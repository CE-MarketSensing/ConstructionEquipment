These competitions included digging a trench, loading a precise amount of dirt, and hauling or maneuvering the machines through obstacles. The third and final round this week in Las Vegas was the ultimate test of precision. Grouped into teams of three – Team Americas, Team Europe, and Team Asia – the nine finalists competed individually and as teams, as they faced three challenges in a specially constructed stadium featuring stands, fans, big-screen TVs, and play-by-play announcers. The finals kicked off with the “Fork ‘n Loader” challenge, where each operator used the Cat 950 wheel loader with Payload technology to load and move material through specified locations on the course. The “Backhoe Services” challenge had operators using both ends of the Cat 420 XE backhoe to open a small box and precisely place small objects inside. This challenge was designed by Jaus Neigum, the 2020 Caterpillar Global Operator Challenge World Champion, and highlighted Caterpillar’s Customer Value Agreements and services offerings. During the final “Trench Run” challenge, operators showed off their trenching skills using a Cat 315 excavator equipped with Grade technology. Final scores were based on the operator’s skills, efficiency, and competence in executing a variety of tasks, with penalties imposed for errors. Awards were given to the overall event champion, the individual with the lowest time in each skills challenge, and the team with the lowest combined score. The operators completed the challenges using Cat construction machines integrated with the latest machine-control and payload technologies, including Cat Payload, Grade and Command, Cat Grade Assist, rearview cameras, return to dig and return to carry.

2023-03-13,"New Cat® 926, 930 and 938 Wheel Loaders feature advanced technologies to simplify operation, improve safety and boost profitability","The innovative Next Generation of Cat® 926, 930 and 938 Wheel Loaders offer a range of new technologies and features designed to boost productivity by simplifying machine operation. Adding flexibility by design, the versatile Cat small wheel loaders offer industry-specific configurations to efficiently handle agriculture, waste, forestry, aggregate and snow removal applications. Customized models can be equipped direct from the factory or through aftermarket upgrade kits installed by a Cat dealer. Delivering efficient power, the Cat exclusive adaptive engine RPM feature automatically adjusts engine speed based on operator input to optimize productivity and minimize fuel burn. Systems are optimized and sized to run at standard lower engine RPM for these next gen small wheel loaders. The productive and efficient 1,200- to 1,500-RPM working range makes the loaders more fuel efficient, while larger pumps run at slower speeds for less wear and longer service life. Innovative drivetrain technology An industry first, these new wheel loaders feature four customized powertrain operating modes. Utility mode: designed for hydromechanical tool use or pick-and-place work with implement power and quick speed, utility vehicle mode delivers fine ground speed control with engine RPM throttle lock. Torque mode: saves up to 5% on fuel by “freewheeling” around corners and on downhills. Hystat mode: provides engine braking with aggressive deceleration, acceleration and no travel until the throttle is applied. Ice mode: for snow-clearing applications, ice mode offers soft directional shifts and extended coast-out for improved control. New auto wheel torque control lets the machine do the work by automatically controlling torque to the wheel and adjusting rimpull control to reduce tire spin. Improving traction on difficult terrain, the new loaders feature standard front axle differential lock with optional limited rear slip differential. On the 926 and 930 loaders, the differential lock is simply controlled on-the-go by the operator with the joystick. The new 938 loader comes standard with automatic differential lock, as well as manual control. Increased precision Cat Payload comes standard on these new wheel loaders with a 250-hour demo mode to test before subscribing. Payload provides on-the-go weighing to help operators hit exact targets to avoid overloading, underloading or misloading materials. Simple in-cab pushbutton kickout settings for upper, lower and tilt allow operators to match bucket position to the task, helping to maximize bucket cutting edge life. Conveniently controlled by a joystick button, a new bucket shake feature provides precise metering of materials in batching or spreading applications and cleans the bucket. Improved safety Incorporating automotive style and amenities, the new next gen cab elevates operator comfort and improves visibility to increase safety. Smaller cab pillars, increased window area, heated and electric rearview mirrors with lower parabolic, and standard rearview camera combine to improve operator visibility around the machine. New options include a multi-view camera delivering a bird’s-eye view around the loader, and rear object detection with visual and audible alarms provides additional alerts to the rear of the machine. New auto temperature control with defrost button provides consistent operating comfort in a range of ambient temperatures. Auto lighting with daytime running lights conveniently illuminates the machine’s lights when the sun goes down. An optional beacon mounted atop the cab gives a visual alert when the operator isn’t inside the cab or wearing the seatbelt to improve safety. The next gen small wheel loaders expand Cat Command for Loading to the global market. Advancing safety and productivity, Command for Loading offers remote control of the loader to remove the operator from hazardous conditions. New for this model series, the command console offers efficient line-of-sight machine operation through the console’s ergonomic control layout of loader functions. The command station positions the operator in a virtual cab with familiar controls and machine displays for remote, non-line-of-sight loader control. Elevating efficiency and productivity, one operator can control multiple machines, one at a time, at different sites from a single command station. Efficient operation The customizable in-cab display delivers an easy view of operating parameters. Using Operator Profiles, up to 50 different operating profiles can be set through the display, which the loader can recall when an operator starts the machine. The next gen loaders now come with two steering option – new force feedback joystick steer control and a low-effort steering wheel – to further customize machine configuration. New joystick steering allows the loaders to travel at speeds reaching 25 mph (40 kmph) as a result of the force feedback feature that stiffens at higher speeds and softens as speed decreases. Additionally, the new loaders offer the option of joystick or single axis levers, and both come with a range of programmable options to meet operator preference. Included with joystick controls, the versatile jog dial offers quick, on-the-go speed, throttle lock, auxiliary hydraulic flow, and wheel torque adjustments as well as screen navigation and creep speed control.

2023-03-13,Caterpillar Exclusive Three-Dimensional Screed Plate System,"As previously announced, Caterpillar Inc. has entered into an agreement with construction solutions supplier, Axenox, Inc., to acquire the intellectual properties of two of the company’s asphalt paving screed products. Under the agreement, three-dimensional screed plates and the modular screed plate fastening system will be available options exclusively for Cat® asphalt paving customers. These new innovations are true market disrupters for the asphalt paving industry,” comments Nate Just, marketing manager for Cat Paving Products. “The innovative three-dimensional screed plate design improves mat density and smoothness as well as density at the joint to reduce compaction expense and improve the chances of achieving bonus. The modular fastening system reduces the time required to replace screed plates by more than 80% to lower costs and maximize paver uptime availability.” Brothers Michael and Stuart Frost, long-time paving contractors and owners of Axenox®, invented the innovative screed system to improve paving efficiency and quality for their paving operations. “Basic screed design had never changed in our lifetime or our father’s, so my brother and I developed our own screed. We knew we had something special with this technology,” says Stuart Frost. Michael Frost adds, “We want to see this effect the industry in a positive way, just like it has for our paving operations. That’s why we chose Caterpillar and the second-to-none support offered by the Cat dealer network as the best way to carry out our vision.” Increased density and smoothness The Axenox® screed plate design is a significant departure from industry standard. Whereas traditional plates are flat, these plates utilize a three-dimensional, angular design. This added dimension delivers lateral compaction confinement to asphalt material. The kneading action helps aggregate to interlock more efficiently than with flat screeds, increasing mat and joint density along with improving mat smoothness. Densities reaching 91% have been measured behind pavers equipped with the three-dimensional screed plates, so there is less of a chance for material shoving and cracking with the roller. These high densities can reduce the number of passes, lowering compaction cost. At the longitudinal joint, higher densities result in improved material containment during compaction to increase final density. Uniform mat temperatures gained by using the angular plates also help to reach specified densities more easily, helping contractors to meet bonus-level work. The stiffer asphalt mat left behind the three-dimensional plates allow the breakdown roller to achieve higher densities before the mat reaches the tender zone. It produces a more stable unconfined edge that resists pushing and shoving by the breakdown roller, so consistent density readings are achieved across the entire mat width. The three-dimensional cast plates are made with high strength chromium carbide, delivering high wear resistance and longer life in the field. Whereas traditional screed plates are run with an elevated front angle of attack, increasing wear, grooves at the front of these plates act as the angle of attack, so they run flat to wear more uniformly and reduce cost. Fast changes A revolutionary new way to secure the plate to the screed, the modular fastening system reduces screed plate change time from days to less than four hours, minimizing replacement costs for the paving contractor. After a one-time installation of the insulated conductor plate, simple screed plate changes are completed using a unique lock-and-go system. This eliminates the time-consuming process of removing asphalt material from the screed to access the nuts and bolts holding the plates in place. Once normal screed set-up and adjustments are completed on the conductor plate, minimal adjustments are required on future screed plate changes. Contact your Cat® Dealer for more information about the new three-dimensional screed system."

So, I grew up doing that,” explained Ferris. “I feel very proud and exited and happy to move on to the next competition and see how we do there.” A look at the events Held on Caterpillar grounds at the Edward J. Rapp Customer & Training Center in Clayton, GOC officials divided the 35 best operators from the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada into eastern and western regions for the semifinal competitions. All competitors completed the same three Challenge events using Cat equipment and technology. “Our Challenge team went to great lengths to ensure a level playing field for all participants, so no one had an advantage,” said Matt Smith, global marketing manager for Caterpillar. “They even tarped the large excavator challenge area so the rain we had the night before the eastern semifinals to ensure that didn’t affect any section of that Challenge event.” Trench Run saw all operators use a Cat 315 Excavator with Cat Grade with 2D technology to dig a 20-ft trench. Depth transitioned from two-feet- to one-foot-deep midway through the trench, and there were marked areas with pipes the operators had to avoid or face stiff time penalties. “I like the excavator,” commented Ryan Totton with Gulf Operators in New Brunswick, Canada, representing Toromont Cat. “You can do almost anything with it.” The Locked & Loaded challenge had operators maneuvering a Cat 950 Wheel Loader through an obstacle course where any slight deviation from the path resulted in the machine knocking balls off cones for costly time penalties. Participants first had to load a targeted 7.5 to 8 tons of material in the bin, requiring two trips through the course. “The final load had to be tipped off to meet target, and the 950 was equipped with Cat Advanced Payload with Tip-Off Assist technology to aid in hitting the target,” explained Jason Hurdis, Global Operator Challenge lead for Caterpillar. The operator then exchanged the bucket attachment used for loading material for a forklift attachment to pick up a sports utility vehicle. The load was then maneuvered through different cones and loaded onto a trailer before being picked up again and returned to its original position, and the operator again switched attachments to complete the challenge. Featuring the Cat 420 XE Backhoe Loader, the Backhoe Bonanza station tested operators’ machine mastery with multiple challenges. They first picked up an I-beam with the loader bucket, place it on a rack and then return it before maneuvering across a trench where they could not touch bungy cords without facing a penalty. Operators also maneuvered through cones with tennis balls, placed a square beam in a cylinder with the backhoe bucket and finally scooped up balls from pylons and deposited them inside an oil drum. “When we set up the course and went through it with our own operators, we knew it was going to be tough, so we raise the time limit from 15 to 20 minutes due to the difficulty,” mentioned Dustin Adams, marketing manager for small dozers and mini hydraulic excavators for Caterpillar. “Most completed the course in under 10 minutes and some under seven. That’s a testament to the quality of the competition.” Other winners The regional GOC semifinals are a culmination of months of competitions held worldwide at the dealer level. “We experienced amazing participation in this year’s Challenge,” said Jessica Nunley, global marketing manager for Caterpillar. “From more than 10,000 registrants, 3,500 machine operators competed in the first round at the dealer level, and only 84 of the best operators in the world made it to the regional semifinals.” Commenting about the challenge, Tony Pennington with Carolina Cat said: “The challenge sends a message to the contractor that they are appreciated. We had a higher number of operators participate during our two-day event this time.” Two-time Carolina Cat winner, Alfonso Fajardo with Spartan Site Services in North Carolina, added, “More people are hearing about the Challenge, and there are more competitors this time, so the competition is really tough. The skills of the operators are at a higher level.” In addition to the overall winners advancing to the finals, the following participants were recognized by Caterpillar with awards.

2022-12-14,Newmont’s Boddington Mine safely hauls more than 100 million tonnes of material autonomously using Cat® MineStar™ Command for hauling,"Western Australia’s largest gold mine, Newmont Corporation’s Boddington Mine, recently surpassed the 100 million tonnes (110 million tons) milestone for material safely hauled using Cat® MineStar™ Command for hauling with the gold industry’s first autonomous haulage system (AHS) fleet. Boddington, a deep open pit surface mine, delivered 19.7 million grams (696,000 oz) of gold and 4.6 million gold equivalent grams (163,000 ounces) of other metals in 2021. The mine’s fleet today includes 36 Cat 793F autonomous and four 793D staffed mining trucks to haul material, and the conversion to AHS was one of the fastest in the industry, spanning approximately seven months to roll out all 36 trucks equipped with Command. Newmont invested $150 million in its autonomous haulage project with goals to improve mine safety and productivity, while extending the life of the mine. The first 231-tonne (256-ton) Cat 793F was converted to autonomous operation in March 2021. A total of seven trucks from Newmont’s existing fleet were retrofitted with Command for hauling, while 29 trucks were new models. In October 2021, the last of the 36 autonomous trucks were in operation at the mine. The mine reached the 100 million tonnes (110 million tons) of material autonomously hauled benchmark by the end of October 2022. “The time period between rollout of the mine’s first autonomous 793F truck to full conversion of the mine’s autonomous fleet to achieving 100 million metric tons autonomously hauled was incredibly short,” offers Kosie Bolton, technology site manager for Caterpillar. “This is a true testament of the great teamwork between Boddington’s talented and dedicated workforce, Cat dealer WesTrac and Caterpillar. The supporting AHS projects will help to improve data understanding and drive operational excellence through data utilization.” Including the autonomous trucks, equipment equipped with MineStar Terrain, and site autonomous vehicles and trucks, the mine has 200 connected assets. An entirely new AHS intelligence office, where all the autonomous trucks and connected assets can be viewed and collected data analyzed, was also completed and dedicated in October 2022. The new workspace brings together all AHS team members in a single space with tiered seating and screens at the front of the room. “Having everyone together in the new office allows us to post issues on the screens in front of all workers to quickly address them together,” comments James Earl, AHS control room superintendent for the Newmont Boddington Mine. “We are extremely proud to deliver the gold industry’s first autonomous haul truck fleet at Boddington. This will help extend the mine’s life, reduce safety risks and lower costs. The project’s record implementation is just another example of Newmont’s trademark ability to set and achieve ambitious goals.” The achievement of this milestone provides further evidence of the transformational strategic alliance between the two companies. Caterpillar and Newmont agreed in November 2021 to collaborate on a number of mining technology initiatives that provide industry leading outcomes for safety, productivity, sustainability and cost.

2022-10-19,"New E-Fence and Indicate technologies for Cat® 6- to 9-ton mini hydraulic excavators simplify operation, improve accuracy, reduce costs and help operators work more safely","Caterpillar introduces two new Mini Hydraulic Excavator (MHE) Ease of Use technologies – Indicate and E-Fence – for the Cat® 306 CR, 308 CR and 309 CR Next Generation Mini Hydraulic Excavators. New to Cat mini excavators, Ease of Use Indicate helps operators to reach grade faster, while Ease of Use E-Fence constrains machine motion to within operator preset boundaries. These technologies are ideal for digging footings, drainage and septic systems, irrigation, electric utilities, and applications near structures or obstacles operators need to avoid. They allow operators of all experience levels to work more efficiently and consistently. Faster grades with Indicate An entry-level grade system, MHE Ease of Use Indicate provides visual and audible indications to bucket position compared to target grade to assist operators in cutting to exact specifications the first time. Regardless of skill level, operators reach target grade faster with improved precision and reduced need for on-the-ground grade checking to create a safer work environment. With Indicate, the operator selects target depth and slope from the in-cab guidance system, and the monitor provides real-time work-in-progress and distance-to-grade feedback. The technology enables operators to reach grade faster without overcutting, saving time, manpower and saving cost overall. Preset boundaries with E-Fence MHE Ease of Use E-Fence automatically constrains machine motion to within operator preset boundaries for ceiling, floor, wall and swing. Operators work confidently and efficiently by avoiding structures overhead, underground, in front, or to the left or right of the machine. Once the E-Fence range limits are established using the machine’s touchscreen monitor, no part of the boom, stick or bucket will pass the predefined limit(s). Setting height limits using E-Fence Ceiling helps operators avoid obstacles such as powerlines, ceilings or tree limbs. Fiber optic cables and underground utilities are protected by the defined depth limits established with E-Fence Floor. Structures in front of the machine are protected by E-Fence Wall, and where the mini excavator is working next to live traffic or walkways or loading trucks, E-Fence Swing is ideal to avoid these areas. E-Fence is ideal for new operators to work within set boundaries and helps minimize job costs from repairs and downtime due to equipment damage and fines from damaging utilities or other structures. For experienced operators, E-Fence allows them to work more efficiently and safely with fewer ground personnel required around the work area. Both MHE Ease of Use E-Fence and Indicate are packaged with Swing Assist and Bucket Assist features at no added cost. Swing Assist, also referred to as return to trench, automatically stops machine swing at one or two set points, ideal for truck loading and trenching applications. It helps operators hit more repetitive swing targets with less effort, reducing fuel use and improving cycle times. Bucket Assist maintains last known bucket angle and keeps the cut accurate in sloping, leveling, fine grading and trenching applications. Current production Cat 306 CR, 308 CR and 309 CR Next Gen Mini Hydraulic Excavators are shipped from the factory Ease-of-Use-ready to reduce installation time in the field. Ease of Use Indicate and E-Fence can be ordered bundled together or as separate feature packages, installed at the factory or through Cat dealers as an upgrade kit.

Today’s D1-D3 dozers also offer a Cat Command for dozing Remote Control (RC) ready option plus include added mounting features and wire harness routing paths to streamline installation of third-party Grade control systems. Simplifying training and operator transition from small to medium machines, small dozers now provide a common technology solution with Cat Command on medium dozer models. Operator assist technologies The Cat operator assist ease-of use features expand on existing technologies: Traction Control, Stable Blade and Slope Assist. Bundled with the Cat attachment ready option (ARO) with Assist and Grade 3D with Assist packages, new Stable Blade Lift and Tilt improves performance over Stable Blade. The feature combines accelerometers with an advanced control algorithm to automatically make minor blade raise, lower, and left/right tilt commands to compensate for machine movement, resulting in a smoother surface. New Blade Load Monitor, Low Slip Traction Control and AutoCarry are integrated into Cat Grade 3D with Assist. Blade Load Monitor produces real-time feedback of current versus target machine load, assisting both novice and experienced operators to fully use machine capacity. Automatically compensating for ground conditions, this technology actively monitors both machine load and track slippage and provides feedback to the operator on current load compared to optimal pushing capacity. With its two operating modes – normal and low slip – Low Slip Traction Control automatically prevents excessive track slip to increase machine efficiency while reducing operator burden. The default normal mode setting automatically limits non-productive track slip when pushing heavy blade loads. Operator-selected low slip operation technology substantially limits track slip in applications sensitive to any minor track slip like material spreading on top of a liner. Working in unison with other operator assist features, AutoCarry automatically raises and lowers the dozer blade to maximize pushing capability and prevent excessive track slippage when pushing heavy loads. When activated by the operator, AutoCarry remains in standby mode until the blade is fully loaded and then automatically engages without the need for Slope Assist or Grade 3D automatics to activate the technology. Faster remote-control installation Cat D1-D3 dozers now offer a RC ready option that simplifies dealer installation of Cat Command for dozing. Cat Command allows the dozers to be remotely operated from a safe distance, eliminating safety risks from potentially dangerous applications. The technology helps increase machine productivity and decrease downtime by allowing production to restart immediately following disruptive processes. By integrating with machine electronics, it allows users to retain the same control as they would operating inside the cab. Maintaining access to advanced machine features, Cat Command for dozing is available in two configurations – line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight control. The ergonomic control layout of the lightweight, over-the-shoulder Command console provides line-of-sight machine control from up to 400 m (1,312 ft) away, allowing for convenient remote operation. Ensuring the user maintains dozer control at all times, integrated Cat electronics activate multiple safety features to stop all machine movements under the following conditions: the all-stop switch is pressed; command stop is activated; wireless communication is lost; a severe fault is detected; or the Command console is tilted more than 45 degrees from normal operator position. The customized non-line-of-site Command station positions the user in a familiar and comfortable seated position, simulating traditional machine control. A single station allows users to control multiple Cat machines one at a time, and it is compatible with other Command offerings for Cat equipment.

Retrofit kits allow miners to expand Command for hauling to existing Cat mining trucks. Since 2019, Caterpillar has won eight of nine greenfield autonomy sites. “In 2023, we will expand Command for hauling to the 139-tonne (153-ton) truck class at ioneer Ltd’s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine. This is the first lithium-boron greenfield project in the United States to use an AHS,” says Sean McGinnis, vice president and general manager for Cat Mining. “We are now seeing a shift toward autonomy requested on new Cat trucks. Whereas large mines with fleet sizes of more than 70 trucks were the early adopters of the technology, we are seeing economic viability for autonomy at smaller mines with a fleet of less than 15 trucks.” Caterpillar continuously monitors the industry for opportunities to broaden the use of automation to help drive safety and efficiency. Beyond expansion of Command for hauling to the Cat 785 for ioneer, Caterpillar sees potential for Cat autonomy in quarry and aggregates. Additionally, Caterpillar’s AHS technology has been deployed on the Cat 789D autonomous water truck (AWT) operating at Rio Tinto’s Gudai-Darri mine in Australia, the world’s first AWT, for automated watering of haul roads.

2022-05-11,"New Next Generation Cat® 906, 907, and 908 Compact Wheel Loaders offer simple intuitive controls, feature-packed options, and an all-round better drive performance","Building on the success of the Cat® M-Series Compact Wheel Loaders, the new Next Generation Cat 906, 907, and 908 wheel loaders boast a reengineered operator’s station, leveraging exclusive Cat technologies to improve operator experience and provide larger wheel loader model comfort on a smaller platform. Featuring the new Cat C2.8 engine, the upgraded drive and powertrain deliver faster roading speeds and drive train performance. The hydraulics and structures have gone through an overhaul, making these new models an optimal fit for many applications. Improved operator experience The new sealed and pressurized cab improves the operator experience, while keeping previous design functional aspects like raised floor pedals and two doors to make cab cleaning easier. Optimum visibility is achieved with larger standard side mirrors, optional parabolic lens electric and heated mirrors, and front and rear camera options. New single-piece front and rear windshields offer 60% better wiper coverage. Seat mounted controls improve operating ergonomics of the new loaders. A multifunction joystick controls travel direction and speed, proportional auxiliary flow, differential lock, and constant hydraulic flow without operators removing their hand from the joystick, elevating operating safety. Like larger Cat wheel loaders, companies will be able to choose from a range of seats, including a new premium heated and ventilated seat. A first for this class size, new in-cab-programmable kickouts with high-definition rotary sensors mounted to the loader arms better protect operators from unwanted shock and vibration due to buckets striking the ground and/or hitting dump stops at max height. Proper kickout operation also saves up to 20% of bucket cutting edge life. Rather than leaving the cab for setting, the operator remains inside the cab while setting upper, lower and attachment kickout positions at the touch of a button. Cylinder snubbing is also enabled to provide the operator with added protection. The heart of the new cab design is the Next Generation control monitor, which offers a range of real-time machine operating information. It allows the operator to configure hydrostatic transmission response, auto engine idle shutdown and a utility powertrain mode that provides operators with a more intuitive means of controlling ground and engine speed, ideal when working with hydromechanical attachments. Upgraded powertrain Specifically designed for Cat products, the new Cat C2.8 engine delivers the same 55.7-kW (74-hp) gross power as the previous engine with 13% more torque, resulting in roading performance and tractive effort improvements. The Cat C2.8 meets EU Stage V and U.S. EPA Tier 4 Final emission standards with alternative emissions packages available. Its shift-on-the-go transmission offers increased roading speeds of 40 km/h (25 mph), and larger fuel tank capacities of 30% for the 906 and 12% for the 907 and 908 deliver extended work cycles. When working in dusty environments, the new reversing-fan option assists in keeping cooling cores clean for more efficient temperature control. Through an in-cab soft-touch button, the system can be turned off, set to operate in an automatic mode or momentarily activated by the operator. Automatic mode uses the factory-setting to reverse direction for 10 seconds every 10 minutes. Frequency and duration of automatic reversing can be changed easily by the operator via the new control monitor. Enhanced hydraulics and structures To meet demand for increased multifunctionality with lift and tilt while powering hydromechanical tools, these Next Generation wheel loaders feature a new standard pressure compensated valve, allowing operators to simultaneously control implements and operate hydromechanical attachments seamlessly. Increased working auxiliary pressures make work easier and improve steering to reduce operator fatigue. Modifications to the optional skid steer coupler improve visibility through the coupler when setting fork tines. In conjunction, realignment of the compact wheel loader fork carriage improves forward visibility. Bucket capacities have been increased across the range adding to the already impressive operating capacity legacy of the Cat machines. New for this class size, an optional Cat 908 high-lift configuration is available, perfect for customers operating in agricultural and industrial and waste markets. When combined with the reversing fan option, the high-lift configuration offers farmers increased operating efficiency and reliability. Available solid tires and the high lift configuration make the new 908 loader ideal for industrial and waste applications. Efficient, high-illumination LED lights options are now available for both working/roading and under-hood-service lights to better illuminate work areas in low-light conditions. Task-focused LED under-hood lighting simplifies servicing in poor ambient light. A unique resistor bank built into the body of Cat LED roading lights keep the lamp assembly warm enough to melt snow and ice, improving efficiency over conventional LED roading lights when operating in colder climates.

2022-05-02,Altorfer Cat kicks off Caterpillar’s 2022-2023 Global Operator Challenge dealer-level competition,"On a cold, drizzly day in March, 25 equipment operators from Iowa, Illinois and Missouri converged on Edwards, Ill. to compete in the first Caterpillar Global Operator Challenge dealer event, organized by Altorfer Cat of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The day-long event challenged the skills of all operators with various trials using the latest Cat® excavators, loaders, dozers and backhoe loaders. “It was definitely challenging,” said Brandon Chandler with Chandler Concrete & Excavating, Foosland, Ill. “We had a lot of good operators here.” Beyond the challenge, Caterpillar’s second Global Operator Challenge seeks to bring awareness to opportunities available for people interested in the industry. “We are highlighting the skilled trades industry and giving operators an avenue to showcase their skills and talents,” explained Jason Hurdis, global market professional for Caterpillar. Referencing the competition, he added, “Caterpillar isn’t looking for the best wheel loader or backhoe loader operator. We are looking for the best overall operator, one who can get in any machine and apply their basic skills and talents to perform on any machine platform for any given task.” The Altorfer Cat challenge, held inside Caterpillar’s Edwards facility, was designed to do just that. A total of four different timed challenges were established using six separate pieces of Cat equipment. “We included the Cat 317 excavator and 982 XE loader, both equipped with Cat Payload as well as a Next Gen D5 dozer with Cat grade control,” said Trevor Shanahan, general sales manager south for Altorfer Cat. Operators quickly maneuvered through various obstacles with total combined time, including penalties, being the determining factor. After the dust settled and final times were calculated, Kent Richmond, project manager for Klocke Inc., Palmyra, Mo. was crowned the Altorfer Cat dealer champion with an overall time of 2,115 seconds. “This was a fun experience. The course was set up well and tested the abilities, skill levels, and coordination of the operator; an all-around good course,” offered Richmond. He, along with 34 other dealer champions selected from March – September, 2022, will travel to North Carolina in October for the North American regional semifinals. Close behind Richmond, taking second place was Chris Dykes, superintendent for McCleary Excavating Co. Inc. of Blue Grass, Iowa with a time of 2,294 seconds. Chandler Concrete & Excavating’s Brandon Chandler placed third in 2,470 seconds. Altorfer Challenge stations To make the 2022-2023 Global Operator Challenge more competitive and robust, Caterpillar set a minimum threshold for dealer competitions of at least three different challenges and three separate pieces of equipment. Altorfer Cat one-upped these standards, opting for four challenges, some including multiple pieces of equipment within a challenge. “It’s tougher than the last challenge,” comments Dykes. All participants took turns at each station. At Station 1, “DOZE IT FIT,” operators used a Cat D5 dozer and Cat Grade with Slope Assist™ to push a barrel around the course with penalties for going out of bounds and crushing the barrel. Participants also created a 20 percent slope with penalty for not making grade. “I didn’t use the technology,” said Mark Weber, Weber Construction, Cascade, Iowa. “I should have used it. I would have scored better.” Station 2: “FORK + LOADER,” first had operators load a Cat 735 truck with 30 tons of material using the 982 XE loader with Cat Payload technology with penalties for not hitting the mark. Bucket capacity meant the third load needed to be tipped off to hit 30 tons, and those using the loader’s Tip-off Assist technology held an advantage. Operators then moved to a Cat 299D3 compact track loader to assemble a metal tree and load tires on the limbs. Station 3: “HARD AS HEX” charged competitors to first pick up a metal bar with a Cat 308 CR mini hydraulic excavator and maneuver it through a series of obstacles. Afterward, competitors moved to a Cat 317 excavator to load 7 tons of material in a Cat 740 EJ truck using Cat Payload with penalties applied for spilling outside the rock box and not hitting the 7-ton target. “Depth perception going up through the (simulated) telephone poles was challenging,” said Chandler. Station 4: “BACKHOE” consisted of a Cat 420 XE backhoe loader putting tires on metal tree limbs, placing large boulders on tires and maneuvering a metal bar to run through obstacles. The final task was to cross a trench without hitting a cord running through the trench. While challenging, the course’s design didn’t include tasks that the operator wouldn’t typically encounter in the field. “The Challenge gives us a great opportunity to showcase new Cat equipment and get our customers in one place,” said Shanahan. “We worked with the (Caterpillar) team at Edwards on the design, and they do such a fantastic job.” The operators’ main take-away at the end of the day was a good time had by all. “It’s just fun,” said Jay Proffitt, Jay Proffitt Construction Inc. of Solon, Iowa. “Altorfer and Caterpillar are so above board on letting you feel like you are the most important person.” In their own words More than two dozen machine operators competed in the Altorfer Cat local Global Operator Challenge dealer event. Here are some of the reactions from the day. “They (our customers) were a little taken aback at the quality of the set-up. We tried to give them a heads-up, but they weren’t quite ready for how awesome this event turned out to be. They were excited.” Trevor Shanahan – Altorfer Cat. “I didn’t come here today thinking about being number one, so I’m excited about it. At regionals, it will be the best of the best throughout North America. It will be good, but it will be rough.” Kent Richmond – Klocke Inc. “Each and every machine is a new experience, even though I have similar types and sizes of machines. It’s a challenge.” Jay Proffitt – Jay Proffitt Construction Inc. “The equipment is brand new and fast, really fast for sure. Definitely challenging. Everything was spot-on, and the guys setting us up were top-notch. They don’t give us any slack.” Andy Joos – N.E. Finch Company, Peoria, Ill. Commenting on the most challenging part of the day, Chris Dykes – McCleary Excavating Co. Inc. mentioned: “The ‘wheelless’ … loader. There’s no steering wheel in it. Imagine driving a car without a steering wheel. It’s different. It’s a smooth machine, but it’s not normal.” “It’s awesome. It’s great to come out and run the equipment. Good or bad, it’s just a great thing. It was a tough course. I was here three years ago, and this is tough.” Mark Weber – Weber Construction.

2022-03-30,Caterpillar Updates Large Asphalt Paver Line for 2022,"Caterpillar Inc. announces updates to the large asphalt paver line. The new Cat® AP600, AP655, AP1000, and AP1055 Asphalt Pavers build upon the proven performance of the F-series pavers that brought fuel efficiency, simplified operation, and more comfort. With new screed offerings, technology that assists with paver setup, better material retention, and enhanced visibility with standard opposite side mirrors, these new models continue to evolve into machines that offer contractors a high return on investment. Front-Extender Screed Additions The new Cat SE47 FM and SE60 FM Screeds utilize extenders located in front of the main screed. These front-mounted extenders are extremely stable for wider width paving and make it easy to quickly reduce paving widths when maneuvering around obstacles by easily drawing material back into the auger chamber. The SE47 FM offers a paving range of 8-ft to 20-ft, 6-in, while the SE60 FM provides a 10-ft to 25-ft 6-in paving range. Optional extension packages as well as berm attachments enable these screeds to perform exceptionally well in a variety of applications in both urban and rural settings. Simple Setup, Repeatable Performance Pave start assistant is an optional machine management tool that simplifies setup for repeatable performance on job sites with similar paving requirements. The integrated system records the functioning conditions of both the paver and screed including paving width, paving speed, and tow-point position to name a few. When moving to a similar job site, the operator simply activates a previously recorded profile from the display menu, and the system conveniently matches machine setup specifications for proven, reliable performance. This option is available on the SE50 V, SE50 VT, SE60 V, SE60 V XW and SE60 VT XW screeds. Material Monitoring Monitoring asphalt in the hopper is a vital function for keeping the paving train running smoothly. However, at times it can be a difficult task. Too much material results in spillage, while too little material starves the feed system. Too simplify this function, an optional sensor has been added for material height with an indicator located on the operating display that enables the operator to quickly determine when to continue paving or when to call for more material. In combination with the height sensor is an optional temperature sensor that keeps the operator informed of the asphalt temperatures being delivered to the paver for a convenient quality control process check. Thermal Mapping Thermal segregation is one of the leading causes of road failure in the asphalt paving industry. Thermal variations can leave uneven surface textures behind the screed. These variations cool more quickly and can lead to less-than-ideal compaction results and shorter life expectancy of the paved surface. Early detection of thermal variation enables timely process control adjustments to be made. To combat these variations, contractors can monitor asphalt surface temperatures utilizing the optional Cat infrared camera and a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) enabled by RTK accuracy. Viewing real-time temperatures, contractors can identify variations and take action to manage the plant-to-paver delivery process and fine-tune paving practices for more uniform lay-down temperatures. Enhanced Material Retention Paver and truck exchanges provide an opportunity for asphalt spills and leaks. A new flashing design on the front of the hopper offers increased memory and temperature resiliency that helps provide better spill prevention. In addition, scrapers located on the backside of the hopper help prevent leaks between the hopper wings and engine compartment. New Styling New trade dress provides a distinguished appearance that helps keep the machine fleet looking modern and up to date. The letter designation has also been removed and will follow serial number recognition for parts and service support. 1 of 4 Cat AP600 Asphalt Paver VIEW FULL SIZE IMAGE Next"
2022-03-16,Caterpillar autonomously hauls more than 1 billion tonnes of material with Cat® Command for hauling in less than a year,"For the first time in mining history, trucks equipped with Cat® MineStar™ Command for hauling have autonomously moved more than 1 billion tonnes of material in less than a year. Roughly 1.2 billion tonnes (1.3 billion tons) were autonomously hauled in 2021 using Command for hauling. In total, Command for hauling trucks have autonomously and safely hauled more than 4 billion tonnes (4.4 billion tons) of material since 2013. To date, trucks equipped with Caterpillar’s autonomous haulage system (AHS) have traveled more than 147 million km (91.3 million mi) with zero loss-time injuries, nearly the same distance as traveling from the Earth to the sun. “Safety and sustainability continue to be top values in the mining industry. We are now entering our ninth year with zero loss-time injuries with Command for hauling, a testament to its safety record,” comments Marc Cameron, vice president, Caterpillar Resource Industries. “A recent five-year study by one of our customers autonomously hauling iron ore reported an 11% reduction in fuel usage – resulting in a 4300 tonne-per-year (4,740 TPY) CO2 emissions reduction – 11% increase in hourly production, 50% higher maximum truck travel speed, and 35% improved tire life.” Autonomous trucks equipped with Command for hauling are operating at 18 mine sites by 10 companies across three continents. Commodities autonomously hauled include iron ore, oil sands, copper, coal and gold. Spanning the 190- to 360-tonne (210- to 400-ton) class sizes, the portfolio of Cat mining trucks capable of fully autonomous operation include the 789D, 793D, 793F, 797F and 794 AC with electric drive. Retrofit kits allow mining operations to expand Command for hauling to existing Cat mining trucks as well as other brands of trucks and loading equipment in their fleet. “We continue to explore new avenues with Command for hauling to make strides toward the fully autonomous mine site and recently surpassed a major milestone of more than 500 autonomous trucks. Our previously announced collaboration with Newmont will introduce up to 16 autonomous trucks through 2023 at the company’s Cripple Creek and Victor mine in Colorado with plans to transition to haulage fleet electrification, supporting Newmont’s target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by more than 30%,” says Sean McGinnis, general manager for Cat Mining. “We currently have in progress high-altitude and new product introduction projects for the smaller 89-tonne (98.4-ton) size class. We have also expanded our Command system to Cat water trucks for haul road dust control at the mine.” The Command hardware and technology is currently deployed on the Cat 789D autonomous water truck (AWT) at Rio Tinto’s Gudai-Darri mine in Australia, the world’s first AWT. Connected with Cat MineStar technology, Command for hauling on the 789D integrates the truck, tank and water delivery system (WDS). The Cat WDS delivers variable waterflow based on truck speed, and the system’s variable displacement pump automatically starts and stops when the truck slows or comes to a halt, preventing overwatering and poor traction at intersections.

2022-01-18,New smart creep for Cat® D3 Series Skid Steer Loaders and Compact Track Loaders maximizes work tool productivity,"Caterpillar will soon launch a new smart creep feature for the full range of Cat® D3 Skid Steer Loaders (SSL) and Compact Track Loaders (CTL) for operating Cat cold planer and wheel saw attachments. Smart creep senses the load on the attachment and automatically adjusts the drive command to keep the cold planer or wheel saw running at the most productive speed. A combination of attachment sensors and proprietary software optimally balances attachment load and machine speed to maximize productivity. By continually sensing the load on the attachment, smart creep increases machine speed when encountering less resistance and automatically slows the machine when encountering higher load. Engine load remains constant, while the operator can monitor hydraulic pressure on the in-cab display panel. Smart creep takes the guess work out of setting the right creep speed for operating the attachment. Without the aid of this feature, setting creep speed too fast can lead to stalling the attachment, and too slow of speed results in productivity loss. Smart creep software smoothly and efficiently determines the optimal machine speed for cutting conditions. With this new smart attachment feature from Caterpillar, the operator needs only to activate the standard creep control system and set the maximum creep speed on the advanced display inside the cab. Once the tool engages the cut, smart creep measures load on the attachment and adjusts the drive command automatically as cutting begins. In the event of the cutter jamming or stalling, an auto reverse feature within smart creep quickly changes machine direction to allow the tool to clear the jam. Targeted availability for smart creep on Cat D3 SSL and CTL machines is the third quarter of 2022. A field installation kit consisting of sensors and machine software for operating the new feature will be made available for existing fleet loaders and attachments. Once commercially available, new cold planer and wheel saw purchases will be shipped from the factory with the required hardware installed, and new D3 SSL and CTL models will come smart creep ready from the factory.
