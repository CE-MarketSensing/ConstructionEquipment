Take advantage of the shift to electrification in the compact equipment segment to secure a fully electric line up of productive and sustainable products across the whole compact range.
Have responsibility for the whole value chain including development, assembly, purchasing and the go-to-market strategy (together with the existing distribution network) for the Compact offering, increasing touch points with customers.
Operate as an independent entity within Volvo CE, fully focused on maximizing the opportunities in the growing market for compact equipment.
Initially be responsible for compact excavators up to 9 tons and compact wheel loaders up to the L50 model.
As part of its ambition to lead the transformation journey through electrification and sustainable power, Volvo CE has set up a dedicated business unit for its range of compact equipment machines and solutions, with the aim of driving growth and profitability in this important and growing product segment.
An increase in population and urbanization has led to the expansion of the construction sector throughout the globe – with a particularly strong increase in the demand for compact equipment. The segment now represents 50% of the total market, compared to 35% a decade ago, with the growth trend likely to continue.
This new global business unit is the latest step forward in the company’s ambitions to lead the transformation of the industry and provide dedicated productivity-boosting solutions built to fit customers’ evolving needs. Thomas Bitter, Volvo CE’s Head of Technology, will take on the role as Head of the Compact Business Unit, from September 2023.
He comments: “Our pioneering work in electrification and digitalization has positioned us as an innovator in compact equipment. And now because of compact equipment’s ever-growing influence on the market, we are focusing our attention on our compact machine portfolio to provide customers with productive and sustainable products and services. The people who join us in this journey will not only develop specialized skills in this important area but be playing an integral role in our wider purpose of building the world we want to live in.”
The new Compact Business Unit will be comprised of committed and passionate people currently within Volvo CE as well as external talent.
Volvo CE was early in leading the way by making an industry-first move to shift its entire branded compact range over to electric and stop development of new diesel variants, back in 2019. Since this strong signal to the market, it has launched five electric compact models: the ECR25 Electric, ECR18 Electric and EC18 Electric excavators and the L20 Electric and L25 Electric wheel loaders. The EC55 Electric excavator has also been introduced to China."
By Press information,6/14/2023,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2023/volvo-ce-moves-headquarters-to-eskilstuna-sweden/,"VOLVO CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT MOVES HEADQUARTERS TO ESKILSTUNA, SWEDEN","Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has today announced that the company's global headquarters will move from its current location in Gothenburg, Sweden, to Eskilstuna, Sweden.","Eskilstuna is already a large cross functional workplace for Volvo CE, with around 2,500 employees from different functions. The move forms part of an ongoing project to strengthen collaboration and innovation with local educational, social and business hubs – such as Mälardalen University, with whom Volvo CE already enjoys a close partnership through which to develop future engineering talent and grow new perspectives and innovations to benefit the company.
The new Volvo CE corporate headquarters will be operational in Eskilstuna – already home to the company’s thriving Technology and Customer Centers – from August, 2023. With its foundations in Eskilstuna over 190 years ago, Volvo CE will be combining the strength of its history with the potential of its future thanks to ongoing investments into the customer center, technology test labs and its recently launched R&D test track.
Volvo CE is a large global company with 17 sites around the world. They all remain important locations for the company’s business, global presence and need to be close to all stakeholders. This announcement will not have an immediate impact on other global facilities or require any move of employees from their current locations to Eskilstuna. Volvo CE will also remain an important part of Volvo Group with its close collaboration in projects and sharing of partnerships to lead the industry transformation.
“With the rapidly changing environment we are living in and the culture we are building, it is a great opportunity to be present at one of our largest global sites. Having our headquarters here will strengthen our collaboration with local educational, social and business hubs, and bring us closer to our operational work. We will of course continue the great and important collaboration with our colleagues across the entire Volvo Group, as well as with our worldwide partners,” says Melker Jernberg, Head of Volvo CE.
“Volvo CE has had a presence in Eskilstuna from as far back as 1832 and it has always played an important role in the local community. We see this decision as boosting Eskilstuna’s image as an attractive business location for companies from Sweden and abroad,” says Jimmy Jansson, Chairman of the Executive Board of Eskilstuna Municipality.
Eskilstuna is located in Södermanland County, less than five hours from Gothenburg and within easy distance of both Vasteras and Arlanda international airports. As well as being the birthplace of Volvo CE, it has a rich industrial heritage that is recognized at one of the city’s popular attractions, the Munktell Museum. It is also known as a pioneer in recycling with the world’s first climate-smart shopping mall selling only recycled or second-hand goods."
By Press information,5/17/2023,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2023/volvo-ce-walks-the-talk-with-sustainability-demonstration-for-top-us-policymakers/,VOLVO CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT WALKS THE TALK WITH SUSTAINABILITY DEMONSTRATION FOR TOP US POLICYMAKERS,Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) brought its industry leading display of sustainable solutions for today and tomorrow to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers’ (AEM) Celebration of Construction on the National Mall event in Washington DC on May 14-16.,"By bringing commercial electric solutions – as well as pioneering prototypes like the Volvo HX04, the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell articulated hauler – to the heart of US government, Volvo CE demonstrates that change is already happening.
But change is not possible without collaboration. The AEM event is a chance to encourage legislators and policymakers to accelerate the infrastructure required to support these solutions.
Volvo CE steers the way with solutions that form part of its commitment to reach net-zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.
Volvo CE played an important role at the Celebration of Construction on the National Mall event, held by the AEM on May 14-16. With its display, it demonstrated that sustainable solutions are available in the here and now, while also showcasing the potential for future technologies. With one of the largest industry line-ups of electric machines, Volvo CE is perfectly positioned to work with policymakers to support and accelerate their deployment.

Stephen Roy, President of Region North America, Volvo CE, said: “We are delivering the solutions we need to reduce carbon emissions and build a better world, but it is policymakers who are making decisions every day that will impact how the equipment industry will grow. In the US, we need federal, state and local governments to ensure the necessary resources are deployed to support the transition to cleaner equipment.”
Solutions for today, like the EC230 Electric excavator, and tomorrow, such as the HX04 fuel cell prototype, were on display.
The AEM event brought together more than 40 construction industry manufacturers and infrastructure-focused organizations to the National Mall, the renowned civic center at the heart of US government in Washington DC. Policymakers visiting the Volvo booth included Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor to the President on Infrastructure and Rep. Rick Larsen, Ranking Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, as well as a number of senior US representatives and leadership from the U.S. Department of Energy.

By Press information,4/20/2023,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2023/strong-start-to-2023-for-volvo-construction-equipment/,STRONG START TO 2023 FOR VOLVO CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT,"Robust earnings and continued demand in Europe and North America have helped Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) increase global sales by 11% this Q1, 2023.","In Q1, 2023, Volvo CE has secured good profitability and a boost to its operating margin with continued demand in large infrastructure and construction projects – particularly in North America and Europe – while increasing its own investments into the biggest technological shift in the industry’s history. 

Compared to the same period last year, Volvo CE is reporting a strong boost in sales of 17% in Europe and 37% in North America. This is more than compensating for a dip in sales in Asia and South America where investment levels have slowed down. With the exception of China, activity in the construction industry has continued to be good across most markets, driven primarily by ongoing infrastructure investments and by the mining industry, which benefits from continued good commodity prices.

Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “Strong profitability and robust sales like the kind we see this quarter is of course important to us and is a testament to the great products and service solutions we continue to bring to the market. But these results also allow us to maintain our industry lead in the sustainable transformation, increasing our investments into zero emission solutions and demonstrating innovative partnerships in what is no doubt the biggest technological shift ever to happen in our industry.”

For the first quarter this year, Volvo CE increased net sales by 11% to SEK 25,109 M from SEK 22,613 M in Q1, 2022 – with the majority coming from machine sales, while service sales remained flat. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 4,587 M (from SEK 2,810 M), corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 18.3%, way up from 12.4% last year. Operating income was positively impacted by a favorable brand and product mix, minimally offset by lower volumes, increased material costs and R&D expenses.

Despite net order intake declining this quarter – heavily impacted by an anticipated drop in China following the pre-buy effect of the emissions regulations change that came in at the end of last year – it was North America that saw the most significant increase of 107% driven by a favorable market outlook. Deliveries in China and Brazil slowed down, while deliveries in North America and Europe, excluding the stopped sales in Russia, increased.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Overall, demand in major markets outside China remained stable this Q1, with notable growth in North America, where many large infrastructure projects and strong commercial construction more than offset a weakness in residential construction amid high interest rates, and in Europe, where construction activity was positively influenced by rental fleet replacements. In South America however, investment levels slowed due to lower business confidence among customers in Brazil. Development in Asia remained flat, due in part to the Chinese market reporting a significant negative correction due to the pre-buy effect of emissions regulations and low economic activity.
While there was fluctuation across the regions, Volvo CE’s global investment into sustainable power solutions continued this quarter – including milestone investments into battery pack production at its excavator plant in Changwon, South Korea and into electric wheel loaders at its Arvika facility in Sweden.
Among the launches already this year was the L120H Electric Conversation wheel loader, fulfilling market appetite for more sustainable solutions in the mid-size range. The introduction of electric products in new markets continued, with a notable launch of the zero-emission EC55 Electric excavator in India.
Another significant success this quarter was the CONEXPO trade show in Las Vegas in March, where Volvo CE launched a range of new service offerings in North America such as Connected Map, Task Manager and Global Load Out solutions, all designed to increase connectivity, productivity and sustainability in work site solutions. The event also marked the handover of the first articulated hauler made from fossil-free steel in North America to a customer, CRH (pictured).

By Press information,3/15/2023,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2023/volvo-ce-helps-customers-see-bigger-picture-with-connected-map-in-north-america/,VOLVO CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT HELPS CUSTOMERS SEE BIGGER PICTURE WITH CONNECTED MAP IN NORTH AMERICA,"Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) at CONEXPO-CON/AGG launched their Connected Map solution for North American customers. The positioning service provides a visualized site overview for all machines — also non-Volvo machines — and vehicles on a site, accessible by personnel in the machines (via Volvo Co-Pilot or Android/iOS device) and in the office (via the Office Portal web platform).","Azadeh Fazl Mashhadi, Service Offer owner site solutions at Volvo CE explained: “With Connected Map, users benefit from complete jobsite visibility. It gives them a visual overview in real time of the position of every machine, every vehicle and every visitor on a site connected to the app, helping to make their operation more efficient and more productive.
“The site management also has total jobsite visibility via the Office Portal, providing at their fingertips all the information needed to optimize traffic conditions for maximum productivity. What’s more, increasing the efficiency of transport operations can also help to cut travel times, minimize material mixing, lower fuel consumption and reduce emissions.”
HOW IT WORKS
Connected Map works by extracting the positioning data from machine telematics or Android/iOS devices with SIM Cards and uploads it to a cloud-based Volvo platform. Whether a Volvo machine, non-Volvo machine, vehicle or temporary site visitor, Connected Map will visualize the position of any unit on site which has the App installed — either in the Volvo Co-Pilot or in an Android/iOS device.
For non-Volvo machines which are regularly on site, Volvo CE recommends fitting the machine with a Generic/non-Volvo Co-Pilot with Map App. This can be purchased as an aftermarket option through the Volvo dealer or alternatively, non-Volvo machine operators can gain access in the Site Map app via any Android/iOS device with a SIM card. Temporary site visitors can also access the app in the same way, enabling easy site familiarization.
Connected Map will visualize a host of typical jobsite features and landmarks, including roads to assist operators in navigating around the site, load zones, dump zones, speed zones as well as restricted zones. Points of interest such as offices, workshops and fuel stations can also be visualized, especially helpful for new or temporary operators. Single lane (narrow road) sections can be defined, notifying the operator if another machine is approaching within a single lane section, helping to avoid traffic congestion.
FAR-REACHING BENEFITS
For Site Managers, the Office Portal makes it easier to manage larger sites and even creates the possibility to manage multiple sites simultaneously. Not only does Office Portal provide a visual overview of all machines, operators, and temporary visitors on site, it also allows the Site Manager to react to the prevailing site conditions. The Site Manager can introduce measures such as one-way traffic or restricted zones and communicate these changes to all users in an instant helping to improve awareness, reduce accidents and increase productivity.
Connected Map users can also stay in the know when it comes to the whereabouts of their machines, thanks to the search functionality within Connected Map, which will look-up and find users or machines in real-time, with the last machine position visible for 30 days.
Away from the office, Connected Map makes it easier for the operator to become more familiar with the site and know where everyone is – including visitors – helping to facilitate a more straightforward, safer, and less stressful operation.
The Site Map application is available for free from the App Store and Google Play. To get started with Connected Map and the Office Portal, customers should contact their Volvo dealer.

The hauler was produced by Volvo CE using fossil-free steel supplied by steelmaker SSAB.
The handover today to Pennsy Supply is another milestone in Volvo CE’s path towards net zero in our value chain by 2040.
Volvo CE celebrated another important milestone in its ambition to drive transformation in our industry towards global climate goals with the handover today to its second customer of a machine made using fossil-free steel.
The A30G articulated hauler was handed over by President of Volvo CE, Melker Jernberg, to Scott Parson, President Americas Materials at CRH – a long-standing customer of Volvo CE – at Volvo Group’s CONEXPO press conference.
Melker Jernberg says: “At Volvo CE, we believe partnership is the new leadership. The handover today to Pennsy Supply demonstrates what can be achieved when we work together with like-minded and forward-thinking partners who share our vision and commitment to sustainability and want to lead our industry to change.”
Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB produced the fossil-free steel using a completely new technology with fossil-free electricity and hydrogen. The result is a significantly lower climate impact in SSAB’s production process – an at least 90% reduction in CO2 emissions - and an important step towards a net-zero emissions value chain.
Scott Parson, President Americas Materials at CRH, comments: “No business can solve the complex challenges such as climate change alone. We need to actively partner with key players throughout our value chain to innovate and create new business solutions. Volvo and SSAB have converted emerging technology in the steel industry into a working model of what the future will look like. We are delighted to be the first recipient of this technology in the US.”
Big actors in the construction industry have a key role to play in leading the industry’s efforts to lower its carbon footprint. Pennsy Supply Inc is part of the CRH group of companies which is the leading provider of building materials solutions that build, connect and improve our world - with over 3,000 locations in 29 countries. Like Volvo CE, the CRH group has Science-Based Target commitments. It aims to be a net-zero business by 2050 and is targeting a 30% reduction in absolute group-wide emissions by 2030. Pennsy Supply Inc, A CRH Company will use the fossil-free A30G at its East Petersburg Quarry in Pennsylvania.
8% OF GLOBAL CO2 EMISSIONS COME FROM STEEL PRODUCTION
Steel is a major component of Volvo CE machines. However, for every ton of steel produced, around 1.9 tons of CO2 is emitted. To achieve its Science-Based Targets and reach net-zero by 2040, Volvo CE recognizes the importance of reducing its carbon footprint across its entire value chain, alongside the electrification of its machines.
VOLVO GROUP’S JOURNEY TOWARDS FOSSIL-FREE STEEL
In October 2021, Volvo Group unveiled the world’s first vehicle made from fossil-free steel. Then in May 2022, Volvo Trucks started to introduce fossil-free steel into parts of its range. In June 2022, Volvo CE became the first manufacturer in the world to deliver a construction machine made with fossil-free steel to a customer. The company will continue to introduce production using fossil-free steel into its machines and components, dependent on aspects such as steel availability."
By Press information,3/15/2023,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2023/volvo-ce-opens-pre-order-tool-in-north-america-for-new-dd25-electric/,VOLVO CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT OPENS PRE-ORDER TOOL IN NORTH AMERICA FOR NEW DD25 ELECTRIC ASPHALT COMPACTOR,Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) announced at CONEXPO-CON/AGG that North American customers can now reserve the new DD25 Electric asphalt compactor online. Deliveries are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2024.,"The pre-order system for the electric machines allows interested buyers to enjoy the convenience of an e-commerce tool while still getting customer support from their local Volvo CE dealer.
The Volvo DD25 Electric made its debut at the Las Vegas trade show and was a popular product among attendees. Roadbuilders were interested in how the machine could benefit their fleets, as were officials from government departments.
“It’s exciting to finally get to show off this new development in our electrification efforts,” said Justin Zupanc, Head of Asphalt Compaction Development. “We’re proud to offer our customers tangible solutions for reducing their carbon footprint, and we’re thrilled to launch our first zero-emission machine for the road segment.”
The addition of the DD25 Electric asphalt compactor brings the Volvo CE electric lineup to six commercially available machines, with a mid-size excavator and mid-size wheel loader in the works.
LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD
The electric driveline of the DD25 Electric asphalt compactor is based on the same proven architecture and components found on the Volvo CE ECR25 Electric compact excavator and L25 Electric compact wheel loader, which have been successful in a variety of different applications and markets over the past few years.
Its zero-emission operation makes the DD25 Electric asphalt compactor ideal for sensitive or urban environments with strict emission regulations and for organizations that are looking to meet their own sustainability goals. Zero tailpipe emissions also mean a cleaner and more enjoyable work environment for operators, site teams and passers-by. If used alongside other electric powered equipment, the DD25 Electric offers the possibility of a zero-emission jobsite.
The DD25 Electric asphalt compactor is expected to operate for a full shift on a single charge (depending upon the type of job and intensity of the work cycle) using the same charging solutions as its forerunners, which allows customers to choose the right charger for their operation. The machine comes with an integrated on-board charger that enables charging from zero to 100% in as little as three hours, depending on AC power level. With an optional off-board DC fast charger, this can be achieved in just over an hour.
The double-drum DD25 Electric asphalt compactor offers 24 kW of available power, which is 30% more than the conventional Volvo DD25B compactor. The result is a more responsive machine in terms of speed and vibrations. It also performs better on grade thanks to the size of its components and better at high elevations when compared to a diesel machine, which loses power as you increase altitude.
Pre-orders opened in North America first and will expand to other regions in the future. Those who would like to reserve a DD25 Electric asphalt compactor may visit volvoce.com/united-states/en-us/products/electric-machines/reservation/."

Designed for customers who need some of the existing system’s functionality – but not all of them – the new ‘Lite’ and ‘Start’ packages unlock varying degrees of access to the core functions of Pass Mapping and Compaction Measurement Value (CMV) Mapping, all powered by the 10” Volvo Co-Pilot touchscreen. With these tailored solutions, customers can now more easily unlock the benefits of intelligent compaction, receiving only the information that is most useful to them and in turn achieving optimum compaction results.
PACKAGES TO FIT YOUR NEEDS
Customers can now choose from three packages from Volvo CE’s suite of Compact Assist tools – whether they are looking for simple compaction measurements right through to complete tracking of both the coverage and compaction of the material – ensuring the most cost-effective and relevant solution, specific to their needs.
1. Lite – The first of the two new bundles, this is the perfect option for those taking the first steps towards improving the quality of their compaction work. It integrates a simple compaction gauge and rear-view camera within the Volvo Co-Pilot monitor, allowing the operator to track the progress of current and recently completed compaction with full visibility behind the machine.
The Lite package is perfect for those taking the first steps in Compact Assist
2. Start – The other latest option combines all the functionality of the Lite package, plus the ability to see completed work across the entire jobsite. With increased functionality, it uses GPS data to provide the operator with a clear map of passes and CMV mapping.
The Start package offers increased functionality
3. Compact Assist – Offering the fullest functionality of the existing Compact Assist solution, this option provides everything that the Start package boasts, as well as high accuracy location and data recording, enabling the creation of reports on the finished job and access to extensive detail on the performance of the roller.
Compact Assist enables the creation of reports on the finished job
INTELLIGENT COMPACTION MADE SIMPLE
Since its launch, Volvo CE’s Compact Assist has been the industry standard when it comes to intelligent compaction tools. Available on the company’s SD75B and SD115B soil compactors in North America, Europe and other selected International markets – and the larger SD135B and SD160B soil compactors available only in Europe and other selected international markets – it facilitates a more successful compaction process, helping operators understand where the ground has been adequately compacted and where more attention is needed – information that is especially useful when working on large jobsites.
One of its essential features is Pass Mapping, where customers can visualize the whole job and keep track of where they have compacted, making it easy to see where work is still required and in turn saving time and money.
Another key tool is CMV mapping, whereby customers are given a complete image of the load bearing strength of the jobsite allowing them to identify a soil mixture that is too wet, for example, or any buried infrastructure. This helps operators to identify areas which require additional compaction or further investigation.
The packages have been created for Volvo Soil Compactors
THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF COMPACTION
With these new more-tailored packages, customers can better integrate the Compact Assist solution into the day-to-day work of their Volvo Soil Compactors, all the while assured of the same great compaction results.
While these packages have been created for Volvo Soil Compactors, Compact Assist is also available for Volvo Asphalt Compactors, including Pass Mapping, Temperature Mapping, as well as Density Mapping and Stiffness (CMV) Mapping tools. 
These packages are available in select North American, European and international markets. For further details and specifications, please visit our Compact Assist page."

Customers in North America and Europe who are already enjoying the benefits of this function have remarked on its ease of use and enhanced safety provision – and the fact it can be easily integrated into their operations.
SET YOUR SIGHTS ON SAFETY
With this solution, customers can operate their excavator in areas where there is a risk of falling objects or where the machine may roll over, such as on demolition jobs. It is also useful for applications where there is a risk of dangerous movement of the machine, for example in areas with poor ground conditions.
Other situations where the Short Range Remote Control can be put to use include tasks where operators need to keep a closer eye on the tool attached to the excavator, for example in piling and drilling applications. This not only provides a better view with increased precision, but also replaces the need for another worker. In addition, the system also enables an improved view for the operator in situations where the view from the cab is deficient, such as during demolition.
In this way, the new solution – demonstrated this week on the Volvo EC250E excavator at the CONEXPO trade show – is delivering enhanced safety, better visibility and increased versatility.
HOW IT WORKS
The solution is offered on request on the EC250E, EC300E and EC350E excavators
The function can operate over a 100-meter distance – more than sufficient in order to still maintain a close eye on the machine during remote operation. Two-way communication via a radio transmitter and radio receiver allows the operator to communicate electronically with the machine.
The system can be easily turned on and off via a switch inside the cab and a light beacon on the outside of the machine alerts those on site as to whether or not the remote operation mode is in use.
The agile system development by CE Engineering Solutions allows for the remote control solution to be completely customized and adapted for unique customer specifications on request.
While it is so far only available on the EC250E, EC300E and EC350E excavators, it is expected that the range will be increased in the future. For now, the Short Range Remote Control is offered on request to Volvo dealers in global markets where these excavator models are available."

Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is launching a new digital solution to simplify the load out process - and deliver on its vision to help customers maximize the productivity of their worksites.","Connected Load Out is designed to improve the efficiency and productivity of the load out process by connecting the loader operator, site office and trucks. It is a digital solution for Volvo wheel loaders with Load Assist and On-Board Weighing and Volvo excavators with Dig Assist On-Board Weighing.
The traditional load out process includes a lot of unplanned work, manual handling and administration, something that affects the work in a non-productive way. Connected Load Out addresses the pain points that truck drivers, machine operators and quarry managers face with the current load out process. It reduces administration and miscommunication by digitalizing orders and load tickets as well as improving visibility, enabling sites to become more productive. And with a more efficient load out process, fuel consumption is lowered, which results in both cost savings and reduced CO2 emissions.
Cecilia Jonsson, Product Owner, Global Load Out Services at Volvo CE, says: “We at Volvo CE continue to develop intelligent solutions that help our customers streamline operations and maximize efficiency. With Connected Load Out, our customers can increase the productivity of their operations by digitalizing the load out process, connecting the site office, loaders and trucks. This enables the site to plan ahead and match incoming orders with available loaders, delivering shorter wait times for trucks and ensuring the loaders are utilized in the most efficient way.”
HOW IT WORKS
Connected Load Out is connecting and sharing information digitally between the wheel loader, site office and trucks in a quarry. Load orders can be sent directly from incoming trucks via the Connected Load Out app to the loader’s Volvo Co-Pilot. The loader operator can see an estimated arrival time and what materials to load, helping them to plan their work more efficiently and reducing stress and the risk of errors. Once the truck enters the site, the loader operator receives a notification on the Volvo Co-Pilot and can call the truck forward for loading and dispatch. A load ticket is created and sent to both the truck and site office making the entire flow visible in the Connected Load Out Office Portal.
Connected Load Out shares information digitally between the wheel loader, site office and trucks in a quarry
A MUST FOR JOBSITE VISIBILITY
Accessed via a cloud-based web application, Connected Load Out is available to view anytime and anywhere, providing a real-time view of the load out process on the worksite. Load tickets and orders can be viewed on the Office Portal and the dashboard can be customized to show the most relevant information for your site and reports can be created.
What’s more, by digitalizing the process there’s less risk of human error, less paperwork and more control, reducing stress and allowing everyone to work smarter.
Connected Load Out is currently available on subscription in select markets in Europe and North America.

In line with Volvo’s vision for zero accidents, the excavator is fitted with Volvo Smart View with Obstacle Detection, providing operators with an enhanced real-time view of their surroundings and automatic alerts should obstacles be detected.
Faster cycle times and improved fuel efficiency help customers to get the job done for less.
Volvo CE provided the first look at a pre-production model of its new EC500 excavator today at the CONEXPO trade show in Las Vegas, North America. This heralds a new generation of excavator, with improvements across cab design and operator interface, safety and productivity.
A successor to the Volvo EC480E, the EC500 is a new 50-ton crawler excavator for the toughest applications, from building and construction, road construction, utilities, quarrying and aggregates to agriculture and landscaping and is the ideal partner for the Volvo A25G to A35G hauler. It will be available in regulated markets including North America, Europe and Korea.
The EC500 excavator is fitted with Volvo Smart View with Obstacle Detection
Stephen Roy, President of Volvo CE North America, said: “We’re excited to share the first look at our next generation excavator. A pre-production model, there will be some differences to the appearance of the EC500 that will be available to our customers, but it gives an insight into the future, with enhanced safety, operability and productivity.
“At Volvo CE we continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions to improve safety and avoid accidents on the jobsite, so the addition of Volvo Smart View with Obstacle Detection is another important step towards our vision for zero accidents.”
The prototype EC500 unveiled at CONEXPO is a new generation of excavator from Volvo CE
DESIGNED FOR THE OPERATOR
The biggest change can be seen in the cabin design and styling, with new layout and features including high-definition co-pilot screen, keyless engine start, wired and wireless smart phone charging and new work mode switch.
A valuable new addition, Volvo Smart View with Obstacle Detection delivers significant safety benefits. Operators enjoy a 360° view thanks to an improved camera system and new radar detection system which provides automatic alerts when the excavator approaches any obstacle, identifying and classifying them as an object or human, and allowing the operator to take remedial action. Three-point access guard rails and a foldable top handrail for transportation are important new safety features.
This next generation of excavator is also set up to access a range of machine options to help operators complete their tasks faster, more easily and more safely, as well as boost their performance and productivity. These include the operator coaching app, Volvo Dig Assist - a suite of tools designed to help deliver excavator accuracy by eliminating the need to manually mark out a site and check depths and grades - and Volvo Lift Assist, all accessed via the Co-Pilot screen in the cab. Volvo Active Control, an automated grading system and part of the Dig Assist suite of tools, will also be available for the first time on an excavator of this size.
Sejong Ko, Product Manager Excavators at Volvo CE North America, said: “With the EC500 and our next generation of excavators, we are utilizing new technologies to help operators work more productively and with more speed, precision and consistency, to help them get the job done every time.”
FASTER CYCLE TIMES AND IMPROVED FUEL EFFICIENCY
New electric joysticks give the operator even more control over the hydraulic system. The hydraulic pumps can be operated together as well as virtually disconnected, allowing the operator to control the boom without affecting track speed, delivering safety benefits and a smoother ride for the operator. This also increases controllability, shortens cycle times and improves fuel efficiency – delivering higher productivity and performance.
Comfort Driver Control allows the operator to move forwards, backwards and steer with the joysticks. What’s more, each operator can set up their own hydraulic settings based upon their preferences and the application they are working on and save them in Co-Pilot so they can be quickly and easily accessed for future sessions.
INCREASED UPTIME AND REDUCED MAINTENANCE COSTS
Increased cooling capacity means the EC500 can handle the most extreme weather conditions and the excavator also benefits from longer service intervals – from 2,000 to 3,000 hours - for the hydraulic oil and filter, bringing both cost savings from reduced maintenance requirements and increased uptime. This means the customers’ machines stay out on the job site and work their best for longer and has a positive environmental impact without compromising on performance.
Manufactured at Volvo CE’s crawler excavator plant in Changwon, Korea, production of the EC500 will begin in Q4 2023 and the machine will be available in select markets. Further models of this next generation excavator will follow."

Using the market recognized conventional machine as the base, which will still be offered to customers, the electric conversion model will deliver the same performance with the upside of doing so emission free.
PARTNERSHIP TO ACCELERATE CLIMATE ACTION
Volvo CE understands that when it comes to delivering a carbon neutral construction industry, we must act now. Which is why it partners with CE Engineering Solutions and selected electromobility partners to accelerate the availability of commercialized electric solutions across all segments and applications. This latest collaboration to expand its line of electric wheel loaders follows Volvo CE’s investment in Dutch manufacturer Limach, announced back in June, to broaden the company’s electric excavator portfolio.
This partnership approach, which allows for speedier implementation to the market, happens in parallel with the company’s continued development of more electric solutions – like the EC230 Electric, a 23-ton battery electric excavator, built on Volvo CE’s own advanced technology. Both approaches are needed if the industry as a whole is expected to reach carbon reduction targets, like Volvo CE has set out in its commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 – with significant emission reductions as early as 2030 – as part of the Science Based Targets initiative.
Carl Slotte, Head of Sales Region Europe at Volvo CE, says: “There is no time to wait – we need to deliver solutions that allow our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Change starts here. Our commitment to partnership allows us to take a leading position in transforming our industry, with electric solutions that are built to fulfil market demand and tailored to suit the changing needs of our customers. Working together, we are scaling up our portfolio of electric machines, extending the versatility of our range and transforming our industry towards a carbon neutral future.”

100% POWER WITH 0% EMISSIONS
The L120H Electric Conversion delivers the same powerful performance as its diesel counterpart, but with zero exhaust emissions and near silent operation. These benefits combine to offer enhanced comfort for both the operator and those working near the machine.
Powered by 240 kWh batteries, it provides a runtime of approximately five hours in most medium duty applications. Consistent with Volvo’s existing charging solutions, it is estimated to charge from 0-100% in just 1.5-2 hours.
With the L120H Electric Conversion, customers can enjoy the following features as standard: Comfort Drive Control, Load Assist with On-Board Weighing plus radar detection with our new Collision Mitigation System. In addition, the L120H Electric Conversion will be supported by dedicated electromobility applications which allow the operator to check battery and charging status and to preheat the cab.
Depending on market demand, it brings the possibility to convert existing customers’ L120H wheel loaders to electric in the future.

Meanwhile China, which has continued to be impacted by low economic activity last year during the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing lockdowns, saw an increase in sales and deliveries in Q4 due to the introduction of emission regulations.
In Q4, 2022 net sales increased by 27% to SEK 27,596 M (21,812), with a contribution from both machine sales and the service market. Adjusted for currency movements net sales increased by 13%, of which net sales of machines were up by 15% and service sales remained on a similar level. For the full year 2022, net sales rose 9% amounting to SEK 100,261 M (92,031). Adjusted operating income for the full year totaling SEK 13,244 M (12,228), and corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 13.2% (13.3).
Global net order intake has continued to remain low with a decline of 23% from Q4, 2021 – although still slightly more orders than the last quarter Q3, 2022 – largely due to restrictive order slotting caused by large order books and long lead times in North America and Europe, as well as stopped sales in Russia. However, deliveries have increased by 4%, again thanks to emission regulations coming into effect in China and the good demand in North America and Asia.
ACCELERATED TRANSFORMATION
While maintaining a steady financial performance, Volvo CE has continued to innovate this quarter by introducing powerful new solutions for the here and now and investing into a more sustainable future. The company is continuing to work towards its vision for zero accident worksites with the introduction of automatic braking feature Collision Mitigation System for Volvo wheel loaders.
Volvo CE also announced a largescale investment into its facility in Braås, Sweden. Over the coming years the plant will be adapted to produce a larger range of articulated haulers with different types of powertrains, including electric. These products will join one of the largest ranges of electric machines on the market, including the Volvo electric compact wheel loaders and excavators, and the larger mid-size EC230 Electric excavator.
Melker Jernberg, Head of Volvo CE, says: “We continue to take steps in our transformation journey – continuing to deliver reliable, efficient and more sustainable solutions fit for our customers’ needs today, while driving investment across our business towards our fossil-free future.”
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Except for China, activity in the construction industry has remained good across many regions, primarily driven by ongoing infrastructure investments and favorable commodity prices. Underlying demand in the North American market remained solid due to steady infrastructure activity and in South America, the overall market in Q4 was impacted by a slowdown of investments in Brazil. Meanwhile in Europe the market remained relatively steady despite signals of a weakening business climate.
Most Asian markets enjoyed continued high demand for commodities, partially off-set by lower construction activity in key markets such as South Korea and Thailand. And while China was still affected by restrictions and lockdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, it did however see a positive development due to the fact pre-bought electric machine sales were coming into effect from December 1, when emission regulations were introduced.

The SEK 65 million (around $6.3 million) investment from Volvo Group will allow the Arvika factory in Sweden – which specializes in the production of medium and large wheel loaders – to expand its facilities with a new building and allow for the phased introduction of new electric wheel loaders.
It is not only a milestone in the plant’s almost 140-year history, but a significant moment for Volvo CE and its determination to be completely fossil free by 2040 – in line with the aims of the Paris Agreement and as laid out in the manufacturer’s industry leading Science-Based Target goals. It is also a pioneering step forward in its ambition for 35% of its machines sold to be electric by 2030.
Coming soon after an announcement to invest in electric haulers from the company’s production facility in Braås, Sweden, it is also a signpost that Volvo CE is committed to achieving more sustainable solutions for customers across all its product lines – and is dedicated to driving that change forward in the here and now. These announcements are part of an investment strategy that allows Volvo CE to advance electric solutions across its production facilities, including also the Konz facility in Germany, Belley in France and Changwon in South Korea, where other electric machines are made.
Site Manager Mikael Liljestrand says: “This is a clear signal of our commitment to building the world we want to live in. It is more than 40 years since we last invested in a new building and what better reason now than to invest in our future, our planet and the next generation. We know that this is not only important to our customers and stakeholders, who rightly have high expectations on us, but it is also close to our hearts to be part of something bigger in building our future.”
Volvo CE has already successfully introduced compact electric wheel loaders to the global market with the L20 Electric and L25 Electric wheel loaders proving to be efficient, zero-exhaust emission solutions capable of driving down carbon emissions while maintaining high productivity across a variety of customer applications. Together with the ECR25 Electric, ECR18 Electric and EC18 Electric compact excavators and the mid-size EC230 Electric excavator, Volvo CE has one of the largest electric ranges on the market.
SUSTAINABILITY TRANSFORMATION
Thanks to the investment, Arvika will erect a new building, approximately 1,500 sq m, which will allow the facility to free up areas inside its assembly factory to be able to build electric wheel loaders. While it has not yet been announced which models will begin their electric transformation and exactly when, production of both electric wheel loaders and more traditional wheel loaders fitted with combustion engines will continue for now on the same production line.
Volvo CE will ensure a phased introduction model by model, taking into account all aspects of the electric ecosystem as it does so, including infrastructure requirements, charging solutions, battery handling and business models. The result will be reliable mid-size and larger electric wheel loaders that can easily be integrated into customers’ business.
It is not the first sustainability initiative from the Arvika facility. Despite actually increasing production last year, the factory managed to reduce its internal climate footprint by 350 tons of CO2 thanks to a variety of emission reduction efforts.
“Our goal at the factory in Arvika, as well as Volvo CE and the entire Volvo Group is to be climate-smart and to produce fossil-free machines,” continues Mikael. “Together, we are quite clear that we want to lead this transformation and be the driving force of more sustainable ways of working for the benefit of our planet.

A compact double-drum asphalt compactor, the DD25 Electric is a zero-exhaust emission solution for small scale compaction projects including street repairs and patching, parking lots, driveways, municipalities and rental houses
Its introduction is an important milestone in Volvo CE’s journey toward electromobility and its ambition to build a more sustainable construction future
The Volvo DD25 Electric will make its debut at this year’s CONEXPO trade show in Las Vegas. The newest addition to Volvo CE’s lineup of electric machines, the DD25 Electric is the first Volvo CE produced electric machine designed specifically for the asphalt industry.
This latest innovation is an important milestone in Volvo CE’s ambition to reach net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 – as validated by the Science Based Targets initiative – and is part of Volvo Group’s target to have at least 35% of its total range of vehicles fully electric by 2030.
Ray Gallant, Vice President Product Management and Productivity at Volvo CE North America, says: “As a global leader in construction solutions, delivering premium products and services, we not only have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, but we are committed to leading the way and providing real-life solutions for our customers that will help them meet their own sustainability goals. We are proud to expand our portfolio of electric machines and extend our offering to the road segment.”
The DD25 Electric is the first Volvo CE produced electric machine designed specifically for the asphalt industry.
PAVING THE WAY FOR ZERO EMISSIONS
The electric driveline of the DD25 Electric is based upon the same proven architecture and components found on Volvo CE’s ECR25 Electric compact excavator and L25 Electric compact wheel loader - the first electric machines available for the construction market, launched in 2020 - which are proving a success in a variety of different applications and markets across the globe.
Its zero-emission operation makes the DD25 Electric ideal for sensitive or urban environments with strict emission regulations and for organizations who are looking to meet their own sustainability goals. Zero tailpipe emissions also mean a cleaner and more enjoyable work environment for operators, site teams and passers-by. If used alongside other electric powered equipment, such as the Volvo EC18 Electric, ECR18 Electric and the ECR25 Electric compact excavators, the larger EC230 Electric excavator, or the L25 Electric and L20 Electric compact wheel loaders, the DD25 Electric offers the opportunity for a zero-emission workplace.
Expected to operate for a full shift on a single charge depending upon the type of job and intensity of the work cycle, the DD25 Electric has the same charging solutions as its forerunners the ECR25 Electric and L25 Electric, allowing customers to choose the right solution depending on their operational requirements. The machine comes with an integrated on-board charger which enables charging from 0 to 100% in as little as three hours depending on AC power level. With an optional off-board DC fast charger this can be achieved in little over an hour, and this also offers a practical solution to top-up the machine’s charge during the lunch break.
Its zero-emission operation makes the DD25 Electric ideal for sensitive or urban environments
HIGH PERFORMING
Combining the proven Volvo Asphalt Compactor platform with battery power, the DD25 Electric offers 24 kW of available power, 30% more than the conventional Volvo DD25B. The result is a more responsive machine in terms of speed and vibrations, which performs better on grade, thanks to the size of its components, and better at high elevations, when compared to a diesel machine which loses power as you increase altitude.
360-degree visibility and high frequency compaction allow operators to achieve a smooth finish asphalt surface with speed. Frequency can be adjusted from 3500 vpm / 55 Hz to 4000 vpm / 67 Hz to cater for different applications.
And with no engine to service - and electric components, batteries and motors all maintenance free, maintenance requirements are reduced too, saving customers time and money.
With the introduction of this latest electric machine, Volvo CE continues to lead the way with products and solutions to help its customers reduce their total cost of ownership and carbon footprint, while meeting its own sustainability goals."
By Press information,1/11/2023,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2023/volvo-ce-introduces-collision-mitigation-system-for-jobsite-safety/,VOLVO CE INTRODUCES COLLISION MITIGATION SYSTEM FOR JOBSITE SAFETY,"Delivering on its vision for zero accidents, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) launches its Collision Mitigation System for Volvo Wheel Loaders – an automatic braking feature that supports operator response and helps reduce the risk or consequences of collision when working in reverse.","The first system of its kind from any original equipment manufacturer (OEM), it assists operators while working in reverse and automatically applies service brakes when the wheel loader approaches any obstacle, alerting the operator to take further action. With wheel loaders spending an average of 40-50% of their time being driven in reverse, the Collision Mitigation System is a valuable solution for operators and site managers.
While not designed to ever replace safe operator behavior, it is a smart tool to further enhance jobsite safety – a central focus and core value for Volvo CE since the company’s inception. As part of the Volvo Group, the company is committed to safety with its Zero Accident Vision which is delivered not only through its products, but also its operations.
Lars Eriksson, Global Product Manager for wheel loaders at Volvo CE says: “We at Volvo CE continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions which not only mitigate the consequences of accidents but strive to avoid them altogether. This new Collision Mitigation System is one important part of our work to reduce the risk of accidents and help fulfil our commitment towards zero accidents.”
HOW IT WORKS
With this new system, customers are moving a step closer to not only eliminating accidents – and therefore improving jobsite safety for everyone – but also reducing any unplanned interruptions that can be incurred during those avoidable knocks and bumps.
It works by identifying when there is a risk of collision and responding by automatically activating the brakes for 2-3 seconds to slow the machine down prior to impact or bring it to a stop to avoid it. This initiation of the braking alerts the operator to intervene.
Collision Mitigation System enhances jobsite safety.
And for seamless stockpiling operations, the system will remember the last slope the machine climbed, allowing operators to reverse down a pile without activating it. It can also be temporarily deactivated for specific site conditions.
Functioning only when the wheel loader is in reverse and driving at speeds of between 3-15 km/h (1.86-9.32mp/h), no matter what gear it is in, it serves as a facilitator to jobsite safety. Even assistance systems like this cannot totally eliminate accidents though, which is why Volvo CE always advocates for safe operator driving behavior.
A BOOST FOR JOBSITE SAFETY
Developed in-house by Volvo CE, the patent-pending Collision Mitigation System for Volvo Wheel Loaders is a factory-fit option currently available on the L110H/L120H equipped with OptiShift, L150H, L180H, L220H, L260H and L200H High Lift wheel loaders.
Requiring a Radar Detect System to be fitted, it works as an additional system to the existing wide range of features, options and site services provided by Volvo CE for its line of wheel loaders, all of which have been designed to elevate jobsite safety and minimize unplanned interruptions.
Collision Mitigation System is available in all markets around the world.

The EC230 Electric, a new 23-ton battery electric excavator from Volvo CE, will play a key role in constructing the neighborhood of 3,000 homes and 14,000 workplaces – helping to build with the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions.
As Sweden’s largest fossil free worksite, it is set to save approximately 2,012 tons of CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 35 trucks driving about eight hours a day over one year.
The 100-year-old ‘Slakthusområdet’ area of Stockholm city center in Sweden, also known as the meat-packing district, will become a testbed for innovation and emission-free construction equipment as work begins on its urban transformation. Construction is set to finish in 2033 and when open to the public, it will provide 3,000 new homes and 14,000 workplaces.
Sustainability has been built in from the project’s inception with a stipulation for fossil-free contracts, including transport to and from the construction site. With a particular requirement that at least one of the larger excavators working on site should be electric, there was only one partner for the job: Volvo CE and its industry-leading range of electric construction equipment.
When finished, the site will provide 3,000 homes and 14,000 workplaces
TRANSFORMATION THROUGH ELECTRIFICATION
The new 23-ton EC230 Electric excavator, offered in selected markets, has already been proving its potential across a range of applications and is one of only a few mid-size electric machines commercially available. Early next year it will be put to work in Stockholm, together with a mobile peak-shaving power unit supplied by Volvo CE, to help excavate 75,000 tons of rock and 96,000 tons of soil in the first stages of the project, for an estimated 2,700 working hours.
Fredrik Tjernström, responsible for Electromobility Solutions Sales at Volvo CE, says: “Partnership is how we can accelerate our journey towards emission-free jobsites. We have powerful and reliable solutions like our EC230 Electric providing all the benefits of electric equipment: zero exhaust emissions, near silence and more comfortable operation. But it is by collaborating with partners like Skanska and the City of Stockholm, who are aligned with our mission to build a better world, that we can really drive the transformation of our industry in a much more holistic way.""
Lisa Kroon, project manager at Skanska, says: “It is Sweden's largest testbed in an urban environment for fossil-free contracting, where we will convert almost 35,000 machine hours to fossil-free. We want to challenge building standards and find new innovations, and we do this in collaboration with, among others, Volvo CE.” 
  Lisa Kroon says: “We can challenge building standards and find new innovations through collaboration”
A TESTBED FOR INNOVATION
Insights from the EC230 Electric’s use will not only be instrumental in helping Volvo CE build the world we want to live in through our electric solutions – providing data on factors such as productivity, cost and scalability – but will also prove useful for other partners in their ongoing ambitions to reduce climate impact through their work.
Anders Österberg, deputy financial councillor and chairman of the exploitation committee in the City of Stockholm, says: “We want to drive the development of fossil-free contracts, and we can do that by setting tender requirements in our procurements. In the contract, where large amounts of rock and soil are to be excavated, one of the requirements is that at least 10% of the machine hours must be powered by electricity.” 
Anders Österberg: “We want to drive the deployment of fossil-free contracts”
Fredrik adds: “The type of procurement that the City of Stockholm has required for fossil-free contracts will contribute to a breakthrough in the transition to electric machines. The EC230 Electric will contribute to 2,700 fossil-free hours in the project.”
Richard Sjöblom, Excavator Operator for Skanska, has had overwhelmingly positive feedback after operating the EC230 Electric, particularly in terms of the ease of charging and the performance of the machine when testing it across different applications. He says: “If I had the choice of an electric or diesel machine in this size class I would choose electric as there are so many advantages over a diesel machine. When the machine was delivered to site there were many sceptics who thought the machine didn’t have the capacity to last the whole day, but they have all been proved wrong!”
Operator Richard Sjöblom says he would now choose to drive electric over diesel
In addition to the EC230 Electric, it is required that all other machines be run on HVO (hydrogenated vegetable oil) – a biofuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90%."

Its zero emissions make it ideal for use in enclosed spaces
Compact but powerful, the L25 Electric makes light work of heavy materials like paper and plastic materials
German firm Böhm Entsorgung is making quite a name for itself in its hometown of Möttingen as a trailblazer in the recycling of paper, wood and plastic. In its enclosed trans-shipment hall, a Volvo L25 Electric wheel loader from Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has just finished sorting a delivery of raw materials for further processing – all completed without emitting any exhaust fumes.
Wastepaper is an important raw material. “In Europe, 75% of paper is currently recycled,” explains Manuel Reinsch, Managing Director of Böhm-Entsorgungs GmbH. “In order to achieve such a high recycling rate, the raw material must first be sorted to ensure that it is as pure as possible, dry, and free from contaminants, such as glue or staples.”
Zero-emission, the Volvo L25 Electric is ideal for use in enclosed spaces
For this reason, Böhm Entsorgung has built a large trans-shipment hall on its 60,000 square metre site, where the containers with wastepaper that has been collected from printing plants, industrial companies and recycling centres can be unloaded and kept dry, whatever the weather.
Between stacks of paper bales, the electric wheel loader uses its shovel to pull apart the mountain of paper that has just been delivered and unloaded from a truck and pushes the material in manageable quantities onto a conveyor belt which then feeds the paper to the press. The fact that the new Volvo L25 Electric wheel loader moves almost silently around the hall goes mostly unnoticed over the noise from the conveyor belts and large presses. However low noise operation was not the deciding factor for the purchase of an electric wheel loader from Volvo CE. “For us, it was crucial that the wheel loader did not emit any exhaust gases because it is predominantly used in enclosed spaces,” explains Manuel Reinsch.
The Volvo L25 Electric packs a battery capacity of 39kWh so it can work continuously for six hours before it requires charging
MAKING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION A CORPORATE GOAL
For this family-run recycling company, an environmentally friendly operation is of great importance. At its state-of-the-art facilities, its 90 employees feed waste and raw materials of all kinds into the recycling process.
Solar panels cover the hall roofs, supplying electricity to power the operation of the presses, shredders and conveyor belts – and now also for charging the firm’s Volvo L25 Electric. “Wheel loaders with an electric drive are an important step for us towards a climate-neutral future,” says Manuel Reinsch. A second electric wheel loader, the slightly smaller, more compact Volvo L20 Electric is already on order from Volvo CE.
With a battery capacity of 39kWh, the Volvo L25 Electric can work continuously for six hours before it requires charging. This is more than sufficient for one working day, as driver Christian Gorowoy determined within just the first few months of use.
Christian is enthusiastic about the performance of the Volvo L25 Electric. “Paper and plastic films are very heavy materials, but the Volvo L25 Electric can handle them effortlessly,” says Gorowoy. He also appreciates the manoeuvrability and good all-round visibility afforded by the machine. And he is pleased that his employer is investing in climate-friendly technologies. “We all need to do something, for the future of our children.”
A LONG-STANDING VOLVO CE CUSTOMER
Böhm Entsorgung has used Volvo CE machines for many years. In its machine park, there are two Volvo L150H wheel loaders as well as two material handlers, an EW240E and an EW160E with elevated cab, both of which are ideal for waste and recycling applications and are used here for sorting old materials and loading the containers.
“The quality, performance and efficiency of Volvo machines speak for themselves,” says Manuel Reinsch. “But the first-class service and excellent support we receive from Alexander Lemke and the entire team at German Dealer Robert Aebi GmbH is just as important.”"
By Press information,10/20/2022,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/volvo-ce-achieves-good-profitability-in-q3-2022/,VOLVO CE ACHIEVES GOOD PROFITABILITY IN Q3 2022,Solid demand in most regions has resulted in a good performance for Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) in this third quarter of 2022 – while the industry transformation is supported by a continued rollout of electric machines in Asian markets.,"Every market outside Europe and China is demonstrating high activity and strong growth for Q3, 2022 thanks to continued development in the commodity and infrastructure segments, resulting in a 23% increase in net sales compared to 2021, a greater increase than the last quarter. This is despite an overall decline in net order intake (32%) and deliveries (7%) – again a smaller decrease than the last quarter indicating a stable growth trend for Volvo CE.
With net sales increasing by 23% to SEK 24,238 M, up from SEK 19,638 M in the same quarter last year, profitability remains strong. When adjusted for currency movements net sales increased by 9%, of which net sales of machines were up by 10% and service sales by 3% - reflecting Volvo CE’s continued focus on service solutions for customers. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 3,773 M (SEK 2,635 M in 2021) with a positive impact from price realization and mix effects, which were partially offset by increased material and freight costs.
PROGRESS FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW
While profitability has been the focus for this third quarter, sustainability has still remained high on the agenda with the continued global rollout of Volvo CE’s electric machines – including the ECR25 Electric excavator in South Korea. In China, a series of customer events were held across the country to introduce customers to the company’s electric offering and charging solutions. Elsewhere, Volvo CE launched a trial test pilot for a product configurator, an online tool that allows customers to ‘build and price’ their electric compact excavators and wheel loaders.
Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “In this quarter we took still more steps on our transformation journey, ensuring that our electric machines and charging solutions are built to fit the needs of our customers in any application and region of the world. Together with our customers, we can lead the transition to a decarbonized construction industry, while still continuing our efforts to build upon our strong financial position.”
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Profitability has been ensured thanks to a robust North American and South American market and good progress in most Asian countries, except China, supported by government stimulus programs and high commodity prices.
After years of growth in China, the largest construction equipment market in the world, the Chinese market continued to be challenging with pricing pressure and weak demand due to lower economic activity combined with restrictions and lockdowns related to Covid-19.
In Europe, construction activity still remained high while a mild slowdown continued with increased uncertainty about the economic development making customers somewhat cautious. While overall global deliveries were down this quarter, deliveries were actually higher in Europe than the previous year, when excluding Russia. The lower global order intake is also an effect of halted sales in Russia and a high order intake in Q3, 2021.

By Press information,10/5/2022,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/volvo-ce-helps-elevate-motorsport-safety-with-electric-car-recovery-solution/,VOLVO CE HELPS ELEVATE MOTORSPORT SAFETY WITH ELECTRIC CAR RECOVERY SOLUTION,The patent-pending tool co-developed by Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) and Granfors Racing has been adopted by the FIA and is the first solution of its kind to be devised as part of motorsport’s electric transformation.,"Adhering to strict FIA safety protocols, the prototype tool allows for electric rallycross cars to be recovered from the racetrack without any personnel handling the car – a first for motorsport.
Volvo CE has co-developed the innovative ‘hands off’ solution with Granfors Racing using a Volvo EWR150E wheeled excavator, Engcon tilt rotator and insulated rescue plate to make recovery quicker, more flexible and above all safer.
Patent pending, it is being trialled as part of the all-electric FIA World Rallycross Championship (World RX) – the next races of which will take place in Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium this weekend (October 8-9).
The new racecar recovery tool is a unique solution in the world of motorsport and is the first of its kind to be introduced to the tracks since the FIA began the electric transformation of its World RX race series. Thanks to the use of this patent-pending solution, the now 100% electric rallycross cars are recovered from the racetracks without any manual intervention – meaning no personnel have to walk on to the tracks and physically strap or hook the car to a recovery vehicle as would previously occur – making it not only safer to intervene, but also more efficient and speedier. 
The solution has been created in collaboration with Granfors Racing and Engcon
Volvo CE co-designed the solution in its role as Official Construction Equipment Supplier and Track Building Partner for the World RX race series, together with Swedish start-up Granfors Racing. After being trialed at the race weekend in Riga, Latvia, in September, it has now been adopted by the FIA as the most efficient recovery solution for the race series. Eagle eyed viewers will be able to see it in action during the upcoming race weekend (October 8-9) in Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium.
Arvid Rinaldo, Brand Communication and Partnerships for Volvo CE, says: “With the speedy introduction of this innovative solution, we are living up to our commitment to push both our industry and motorsport forward when it comes to safety and sustainability. Thanks to this strong partnership with the FIA and Engcon, we are able to accelerate a shift towards electrification that is reliable, efficient and most vitally safe.”
In safe hands
With the advent of electric rallycross racing come entirely new safety considerations given that the rallycross cars can accelerate from 0-100km/h in less than two seconds – quicker than a Formula 1 car – combined with the inevitable care that needs to be factored in when handling electrically charged vehicles.
Benoît Dupont, Off-Road Category Manager for the FIA, says: “Electric racing is a new technology which brings new challenges around safety – we need to adapt to that and create new tools. Volvo CE has been really proactive in helping us, creating a tool that allows us to remove the car in a safe and efficient way. And this is really what we were looking for – to add electric safety on top of efficiency.”
Because safety is not something to be taken lightly, the FIA has introduced a smart traffic-light system as part of its new electromobility safety protocols. Whenever an electric rallycross car comes off the racetrack, a green light on top of the car indicates the safety status of the car. If it turns red, it indicates to those nearby that it is not safe to touch the car and to await official recovery of the vehicle.
The power of three 
To keep in line with this system and to allow the safe recovery of electric rallycross cars that have ‘turned red’, Volvo CE and Granfors Racing came up with their own three-fold safety system. Once drivers have been safely recovered from the car by trained officials, the car is then carefully picked up by a flat insulated rescue plate, which is controlled, lifted, lowered and angled as necessary with a 360° Engcon tilt rotator attached to a Volvo EWR150E wheeled excavator. The combination of these three tools together not only ensures the safe handling of battery-powered vehicles but also provides unrivalled efficiency and flexibility. The EWR150 wheeled excavator, run on biofuels, offers a tight, compact swing essential for the complex maneuvers required during this process and the reliable handling needed to quickly and safely deliver the crashed racecar to the designated recovery area.
Developed in collaboration with Engcon, which provided the tilt rotator attachment, and tested under thorough safety requirements set by the FIA, the result is a collaborative innovation set to break new boundaries in motorsport safety.
Morten Fjeld-Nielsen, Sales Manager for Engcon Norway, says: “It’s fantastic to see Volvo CE finding innovative ways to use our tilt rotators in racing – proving how flexible and adaptable our solutions are to any application. Without this type of tool, the ability to rescue cars in the fast and efficient way that we do now maybe wouldn’t even be possible.”
The solution is also making a huge difference to driver safety. Klara Andersson, one of the drivers for the Construction Equipment Dealer Team, says: “While we always strive to win and every race is an adrenalin ride from start to finish, we know that our safety is always front of mind at World RX, particularly as we navigate this new era for electric racing. With this new robust set-up, we can be confident that our safety is in good hands – and that any interruptions to the race are kept to the absolute minimum.”
You can watch all the action of the race in Belgium on World RX’s live streaming channel RX+."

By Press information,7/19/2022,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/volvo-ce-remains-strong-in-q2-2022/,"VOLVO CE REMAINS STRONG IN Q2, 2022",Moderate fluctuations across different regions have seen sales remain flat for Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) in the second quarter of this year – resulting in a solid performance during challenging market conditions.,"Volvo CE has maintained its strong position on the market – while taking action to build a more sustainable construction equipment offering for today and tomorrow. It has enjoyed a solid performance for the last quarter, despite lower deliveries, down by 27%, due primarily to the market decline in China. Net order intake has also declined by 42% in the last quarter as a consequence of this drop in China and a natural outcome from the high order intake experienced during the same quarter 2021.
However, the downturn in China has been well compensated by growth in the rest of the world. In Q2, 2022, total net sales were flat at SEK 25,814 M (SEK 25,839 M in Q2, 2021) – remaining steady due to market variations which saw sales greatly increase in North America (28%) and South America (121%) but drop slightly in the larger markets of Europe (-2%) and Asia (-24%). While service sales continued to rise, enjoying an increase of 5%, net sales of machines declined by 11%.
Volvo CE is continuing to weather the challenges created by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine by supporting its communities, preparing for the future and providing more sustainable solutions in the here-and-now with its strong focus on electromobility and services. This last quarter has demonstrated its commitment to building a better world with the world’s first customer handover of a machine made using fossil-free steel and investment in Dutch firm Limach to expand its already industry-leading electromobility portfolio.
Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “Thanks to the hard work of our colleagues and supply chain partners, we are enjoying a confident performance with solid sales on a par with last year. With our dedication to expanding our electromobility offering and taking action to place more sustainable construction solutions into the hands of our customers, we not only remain strong in the face of an unpredictable global outlook but are geared for growth.”
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Construction activity in most markets has remained on good levels, driven by both the commercial sector and the ongoing investments in infrastructure. While the Chinese market declined due to lower economic activity and pricing pressures, Asia outside of China instead saw strong growth in key markets supported by government stimulus and high commodity prices. There is a continued need to renew and expand an aging infrastructure in many countries across the world, with the South American market remaining on a favorable trend with demand for commodities on a high level. While construction activity in both Europe and North America remained high in Q2, total market deliveries were impacted by limited machine availability because of supply chain constraints.
The quarter also marked an important event for Volvo CE with the return of its flagship Volvo Days in Eskilstuna, Sweden, for the first time in four years. Under the banner of ‘Change Starts Here’, over 7,000 customers visited the company’s headquarters to take a closer look at its industry-leading line-up of products and services for today and tomorrow.

Vattenfall the Independent Distribution Network Operator has been contracted by Independent Connection Provider Pascon to take ownership of the High Voltage cables from the grid connection point to the Low Voltage supply point for the electric vehicle charging points.
Darren Fitch, Head of UK Sales Area at Volvo CE, says: “We believe in the power of partnership to accelerate our goals towards a carbon neutral future. A global transition to electric vehicles powered by renewable energy is fundamental to those ambitions, so it is great to see a more sustainable way of working in place right from the beginning: building the electric infrastructure we need with electric construction machines like our ECR25 Electric. It is clear that by working together with forward-thinking partners like Vattenfall and Pascon, we can build the world we want to live in, the right way.”
The ECR25 Electric hard at work.
Stewart Dawson, Managing Director at Vattenfall IDNO says: “Vattenfall work with our partners to reduce carbon emissions wherever possible, and we are delighted to be working with Volvo CE and Pascon on this innovative project. Partnerships like this are important to enable us to meet the climate challenge. By connecting Pascon with SMT, the suppliers of the electric digger, we have been able to reduce emissions from the installation of our cabling and the other on-site works.
“Electrification of transport is core to our strategy to power climate smarter living. As demand for electric vehicle charging grows, our strengthened, smart, electricity networks are going to be the thread that ties the whole plan for reaching net zero together.”

By Press information,7/5/2022,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/volvo-ce-enters-gaming-with-farming-simulator/,VOLVO CE ENTERS GAMING WITH FARMING SIMULATOR,"For the very first time, gaming fans will feel all the thrill of driving a Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) machine from the comfort of their living room, thanks to a new partnership with fully immersive video game Farming Simulator 22.","Building the world we want to live in is not only a purpose that Volvo CE lives by, but is also the premise behind Farming Simulator 22 – allowing players to create their own farming ecosystem in any number of ways. It is the latest iteration of the popular game by Swiss gaming developer and publisher GIANTS Software.
Volvo CE’s role in the game will be to provide players with the opportunity to experience a true-to-life logging and forestry worksite through a number of gamified Volvo CE machines – most notable among them will be the new Volvo L200H High Lift wheel loader.
The wheel loader, only recently unveiled by Volvo CE, is characterized by its greatly increased lifting capacity and added power compared to its predecessor, the Volvo L180H High Lift market-leading in the logging industry. It will be featured in Farming Simulator 22, alongside other soon-to-be-revealed Volvo machines.
FULLY IMMERSIVE PARTNERSHIP
Arvid Rinaldo, Brand Partnerships at Volvo CE says: “We are excited to take our first active steps into the booming world of gaming with GIANTS Software. It will not only be a unique chance for players to bring our machines to life, but the game also represents a great opportunity to introduce a younger generation to all the thrill of machine operation.”

While we align for an exciting project, players can look forward to the Volvo CE-powered reinforcement of gameplay aspects in Farming Simulator 22 in the near future.”
FROM REAL WORLD TO VIRTUAL WORLD
Given this is the first time construction machines like the Volvo L200H High Lift have been gamified, developers had to take extra effort to digitalize them. A team of developers visited a real-world construction site to study the machines in action and then transfer the machines’ real-life movements into the virtual sphere. In doing so that they were able to map out a digital version as close as possible to the original.
The most exciting aspect of gaming is that players can do things they generally do not get to do otherwise. So for Volvo CE, it is a chance to introduce operator skills to an audience who may not have been able to access them before.
With this latest version of Farming Simulator, players can add additional levels of complexity – so whether they are a younger player who wants to simply drive a Volvo L200H High Lift wheel loader or a more strategic player looking to create their own unique farming production chain from logging through to market, there is something for everyone. And family-friendly Farming Simulator, which also includes Volvo Trucks in the game, stands out against other popular fantasy games by providing a true-to-life education into the agriculture industry and a unique space for unlimited creativity.

Following the completion of a multi-stakeholder research project aimed at breaking new ground in hydrogen technology, the company has started testing of the world’s first fuel cell articulated hauler prototype, the Volvo HX04. The results of the project will provide important insights into the possibilities provided by hydrogen and fuel cells as Volvo CE continues research for its future product development programs.","Acting on its Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) commitment of net-zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, and driving industry transformation towards carbon neutrality, Volvo CE has accelerated its work into sustainable power sources.
Besides battery-electric solutions, where Volvo CE is already offering the largest range of commercial products, the company’s efforts also include exploring the potential of electrification through hydrogen fuel cell technology. Now, an important milestone has been reached with the testing of a world-first emission free hydrogen fuel cell articulated hauler prototype, the Volvo HX04. 
Carolina Diez Ferrer, Head of Advanced Engineering Programs at Volvo CE, says: “Being inventors of the world’s first articulated hauler more than 55 years ago, we are happy and proud to again drive change with this fuel cell hauler concept. While an early prototype, this innovation will give valuable insights into the opportunities of hydrogen in the energy transformation alongside battery-electric solutions. We believe that by exploring multiple technologies and working in partnership we can create the best path forward to decarbonize the construction industry.”
Driving change through partnerships
The Volvo HX04 is the result of a research project running between 2018 and 2022, with funding from FFI, a national collaboration between the Swedish Innovation Agency VINNOVA, Swedish Energy Agency, and Swedish Transport Administration, to support sustainable vehicle strategic research, innovation and development. Partners include Volvo CE, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, who provided specialist competence on driveline development and safety, and PowerCell Sweden, a developer of fuel cell-based hydrogen-electric power solutions.
The development and building of the six-wheel prototype has largely been carried out at Volvo CE’s facility in Braås, Sweden – the same location where Gravel Charlie, the world’s first articulated hauler, was born back in 1966, giving the Volvo HX04 the nickname “Electric Charlie”. Engineers at the Technology Center in Eskilstuna, Sweden, have contributed with software development and knowledge gathered through its fuel cell test lab. While not commercially available, valuable insights from the concept will inevitably inform future production.
Hydrogen refueling station
Infrastructure for hydrogen is still in development, which means refueling the Volvo HX04 is an important aspect to solve in the project. Shell installed a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling station at the Volvo CE test track in Braås. Both Shell and Volvo Group are founding members of H2Accelerate, a collaboration of companies working to foster conditions for the mass market roll-out of hydrogen trucks in Europe.
Oliver Bishop, Shell’s General Manager for Hydrogen Mobility, says: “Providing the fueling infrastructure for this innovative project gave Shell the opportunity to demonstrate our technical capabilities in hydrogen, and enabled us to support one of our key global collaboration partners in taking another step forward in their decarbonization journey, which goes to the heart and intent of Shell’s Powering Progress strategy.”
How it works
The fueling process for hydrogen vehicles is fast – the Volvo HX04 is charged with 12 kg hydrogen in circa 7,5 minutes, enabling it to operate for approximately four hours. Fuel cells work by combining hydrogen with oxygen and the resulting chemical reaction produces electricity which powers the machine. In the process, fuel cells also produce heat that can be used for heating of the cab. Fuel cells only emit one thing – water vapor.
In principle, a fuel cell works much like a battery except that it generates its own electricity from the hydrogen onboard as needed rather than being charged from an external source. Vehicles with fuel cell electric powertrains have an uptime, range, and fueling time similar to that of combustion engine powered vehicles.
While battery-electric vehicles and biofuels are commercially available today – as more sustainable alternatives to diesel – commercialization of hydrogen-powered machines is expected during the second half of this decade."

So, when asked to support the build of the tracks for the new 680bhp electric cars, the company decided to use its off-road expertise to help World RX in designing and testing a whole new series of track elements that will encourage the racing to be as close as it is thrilling.
WORLD RX TRACKS 2.0
Following a series of workshops on what features make the ‘perfect’ rallycross track, Volvo CE invited the FIA, Race Series organizer Rallycross Promoter GmbH and professional drivers Timmy Hanssen, Klara Andersson and Niclas Grönholm to its specially developed ‘RallyCross Test Lab’ at the GTR racetrack in Eskilstuna, Sweden. Here, Volvo CE has helped test and design jumps, turns and dynamic features to keep the racing electrifyingly close. These included steeply banked turns, chicanes and epic jumps. 

During a three-day test at the Rallycross Test Lab in early May, each track element was closely evaluated, with lots of ideas on how to encourage more overtaking and a greater spectacle for racegoers. The racing experts’ suggested improvements – which were then quickly realized using Volvo CE’s machines, refining each element until it was considered perfect. Once each feature was signed off by the FIA, the build data was captured in 3D on Volvo CE’s Dig Assist in-cab machine control application. These data can then be programmed into Volvo machines and recreated at each of the tracks the race series visits during the coming World Championship. This will not only reduce the build time of each track considerably, but also do it with minimal carbon footprint.
DESIGNED FOR RACERS – BY RACERS
Klara Andersson, driver for the new Construction Equipment Dealer Team, is looking forward to trying out the new tracks
“The new tracks are going to be awesome!” says Klara Andersson, who drives for the new Construction Equipment Dealer Team in the forthcoming championship. “The jumps are epic – the fastest ones we will hit at 100 km/h and fly through the air for 25 meters and more!”

“The new race elements will be thrilling to drive,” agrees Klara’s teammate Niclas Grönholm. “The steep banking means we will be able to drive through turns on full throttle, while other corners are cleverly designed so that there are multiple racing lines – leading to wheel-to-wheel racing and more overtaking.”
NO COMPROMISE CONSTRUCTION
A series of workshops were held to determine the most exciting and efficient track builds.
“Our aim is to create the next generation of thrilling Rallycross circuits in the most effective and sustainable way,” says Arvid Rinaldo, who heads up the partnership and the operational involvement in World RX for Volvo CE. “Our ultimate aim is to support the build and upgrade of tracks with a zero-carbon footprint, but thanks to the use of our electric equipment and latest low-emission engines running on biofuels, even at the outset we hope to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of each track build.

Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 2,810 M (SEK 3,822 M in Q1, 2021), corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 12.4%, down from 15.4%. The operating income has been negatively affected by lower machine volumes and higher material costs, which were partially mitigated by improved price realization and higher service volumes. 

The elevated levels of order intake from the same period last year as the world recovered somewhat from the impact of the pandemic, has meant there has been a drop in order intake for Q1, 2022 – declining by 42%. While mainly due to the continued decline in China, order intake has also felt the effect of a cancellation of orders in Russia and restrictive order slotting due to large order books. Effects from a strained supply chain have also led to deliveries decreasing by 33%.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
The European market grew by 13% in the first two months of the year, influenced by a large number of investments in infrastructure and housing, while North America increased by 20% thanks to the high levels of housing construction and manufacturing in the region. Due to the strong demand for commodities, South America has continued its robust rise in market demand with a 45% increase on the same quarter last year. However, all of this has been affected by a 33% decline in the Chinese market, primarily due to a spike in Covid-19 cases that has led to restrictions and lockdowns across the country, but also due to a price pressure that remains primarily on excavators. Asia outside of China has also been negatively impacted by price increases on machines in India, related to new emission regulations, and has reported an 8% fall.

Volvo CE is demonstrating a solid performance during challenging times, while also continuing its evolution as a sustainable leader, not just for the company but for the industry and society as a whole. This quarter marks the successful launch of its first fully electric machine in the Asian market – the ECR25 Electric compact excavator – now available for customers to buy in South Korea and the introduction of a tailored CO2 Reduction Program aimed at helping customers realize their own unique goals towards carbon neutrality.

By Press information,4/19/2022,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/volvo-construction-equipment-carl-slotte-change-starts-here/,CHANGE STARTS HERE - A CALL FOR ACTION,"“If I were an adult, I would care for the environment a lot more than grown-ups do today - we need to make the world better! I worry that one day I might not be able to play in the forest anymore.” These words from seven-year-old Siri Riutta echo the concerns of millions of children across the world.","Like Siri, caring for the environment comes natural for the younger generation. Their call for action to the older generation, that today holds the power to decide how to combat climate change, is real and at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) we listen and acknowledge the vital role we have to play to drive the change needed. What’s more, we owe it to Siri and to future generations. We are probably the last generation that can make a real difference and build the world we want to live in, rather than the world we are left with.
Carl Slotte, Head of Sales Region Europe, comments on the need for change. “First of all, I am extremely proud to work for a company, like Volvo CE, that has ambitious and concrete sustainability goals. As one of the leading companies in our industry we have a responsibility, and we take it. Our climate targets are clear: from 2040 we shall have 100% fossil fuel free vehicles across the Volvo Group and reach net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions.”
As an enabler and platform to drive the message of change, Volvo CE is today launching the new marketing campaign, ‘Change Starts Here’. This new marketing approach has two main purposes. The first is to take the lead in driving change within the very important areas of sustainability, electromobility and services and to encourage all our stakeholders to join to take action. And the other is to demonstrate to customers how we are transforming our industry through our offering within these three key areas – and to do so while giving them an equally good experience of these messages no matter if they engage through a virtual or physical platform. That is what the omnichannel approach is about.
Last year, Volvo CE announced its intentions to adopt a new omnichannel marketing approach that will allow us to connect with our customers, dealers and other stakeholders via a mix of virtual and physical events. Whilst the challenges we face require us to work more closely and collaboratively, it is just not practical or sustainable for this to be all in-person. So, we are soon launching an exciting new virtual platform and offering our stakeholders choice in how they interact with us. Volvo Days, our flagship customer relationship building event in Eskilstuna, Sweden in June, will, for example, have a new look and feel, with both physical and virtual options to join us and experience what we have to offer. Digital and physical experiences connected in a way not done before – coupled with the red thread of sustainability, electromobility and services.
Carl Slotte
Sustainability is the overarching umbrella for our strategic agenda where clearly defined science-based targets make the foundation for our future development. Electrification is one key to drive a fossil-free industry going forward and Volvo CE is today offering the widest range of electric compact machines on the market and has a clear pathway to grow and extend our electric offering, from compact machines to heavy equipment. Another proof point of our commitment to drive electrification in partnership is the cooperation with the FIA World Rallycross Championship, which gives us a global platform to demonstrate the potential of electric power across industries.
With our services, we have an opportunity to help customers maximize the productivity and efficiencies of their worksites. Our recently launched CO₂ Reduction Program, for example, is just one way we are looking to help customers tackle their carbon footprints and we are continuing to evolve the services and solutions we offer.
We have a real opportunity to make a difference together, and to build the world we want to live in; for us, for Siri and the future generations, customers, suppliers, policymakers. Let´s do this together! Change Starts Here."

In a shared commitment to reduce its environmental impact, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is making it easier for customers to reach their own carbon reduction goals with personalized plans.","Taking advantage of the breadth of its existing solutions and services, Volvo CE has developed a step-by-step approach with the CO2 Reduction Program to help customers realize their own unique goals towards carbon neutrality. There is no one-size-fits-all solution and every customer’s business is different, which is why these tailored solutions offer a practical way to make significant improvements to how machines are used on site today and in the future.
Niklas Nillroth, Head of Sustainability and Public Affairs at Volvo CE, says: “Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time, and one of the most important actions we can take is to help reduce our customers’ emissions. It is vital to get everyone involved and make it easy to contribute as part of one’s daily work. Every step on the path to net zero counts.”
“The services we use have been built on decades of innovation here at Volvo CE, but now for the first time we are bringing them together in one cohesive program that can be individually tailored to best fit our customers’ needs.”
CO2 REDUCTION IN FOUR STEPS
The CO2 Reduction Program is designed to be easily integrated into customer’s plans, while maintaining required levels of profitability and productivity, and is based on four simple steps:
Insights – Volvo CE starts by understanding where the customer currently is in terms of carbon emissions and establishing a baseline to compare against. Using telematics data from connected machines, Volvo CE determines the CO2 footprint for all machines on site – no matter the brand. Mapping this data then allows the customer to visualize the impact of carbon reduction changes over time.
Analyze – The experts at Volvo CE analyze the customer’s machine data and conduct a site study to understand how the material flow, fleet composition, and operator behavior affects the emissions on their site(s). Volvo CE then illustrates where improvements can be made and what actions need to be taken to reduce CO2 /ton. Using Volvo Site Simulation, the experts reveal to the customer the impact of these improvements to help motivate real change.
Improve – After identifying the specific actions required, Volvo CE helps the customer to implement them. This will vary from customer to customer, but Volvo CE is there to support with key services such as Eco Operator training and other efficiency services such as Efficient Load Out – or plan a smooth transition towards electric machines.
Sustain – At this stage the customer will already start seeing the rewards of their efforts, both economically and environmentally. However, the final step is for Volvo CE to support in sustaining these efforts, by continuously monitoring the CO2 level over time, to make sure that the improvements reduce emissions and customers do not slip back into old habits. Volvo CE will also look for new ways to reduce emissions even further in the future.
LEADING THE WAY. TOGETHER.
This customer program is one of many initiatives devised by Volvo CE towards the needed transformation within the construction industry. The company has set an industry-leading target to reach net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 – with a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions across its own operations and a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions across product use as early as 2030.
In 2013, Volvo CE introduced the world’s first carbon neutral construction equipment production facility in Braås, Sweden – which recently built the world’s first vehicle made of fossil-free steel - and in addition currently offers the largest range of electric machines.
Volvo CE encourages customers to find out how they can elevate their efforts to reach net zero or take the first step on their sustainability journey today by contacting their local dealer or visiting the Volvo CO2 Reduction Program."
By Press information,3/25/2022,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/volvo-ce-brings-its-first-commercial-electric-machine-to-asia/,VOLVO CE BRINGS ITS FIRST COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC MACHINE TO ASIA,"The zero-emissions, near silent ECR25 Electric excavator by Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is now available to order for customers in South Korea – responding to the market’s increased focus on more sustainable construction solutions.","The 2.5-ton battery electric compact excavator is the first electric machine by a major manufacturer to arrive in the Asian market – launching first in Korea with further roll out planned for China, Japan and Singapore. The demand for electric equipment has been growing across the region, prompted by stronger emission regulations, government incentives and an urgent desire to build more sustainably. 

The Volvo ECR25 Electric excavator has already proved a success in Europe and North America since it was unveiled in 2019, thanks to its ability to match power and performance with zero emissions, near silence and a much more comfortable work environment for operators. Korea was chosen as the first market for Asia due to its adoption of new technologies and innovative ways of working – as well as its quick response to building an electric charging infrastructure.

Jaetack Lim, Head of Market Korea at Volvo CE Region Asia, says: “Increasingly, authorities are recognizing the need to work more sustainably and embrace new technologies that will allow us to tackle our global climate change crisis with equipment that provides less noise, fewer vibrations and no exhaust fumes. We are proud to be leading the charge by being the first major manufacturer to offer electric solutions to a region that is so significant to the global construction equipment market.”
BUILDING TOMORROW
The introduction to the Asia market represents the next step in Volvo CE’s ambition to move its range of compact excavators and wheel loaders to electric, stopping entirely new diesel engine-based development of these models. As such, the market can expect more electric compact equipment to be introduced in the future. The launch also represents the company’s continued investment into building the world we want to live in – with electric solutions forming a major part of that ambition.

The ECR25 Electric excavator comes with an integrated on-board charger allowing customers to charge from 0 to 80% in under six hours. With an optional fast off-board charger (380V-420V three phase), it takes just one hour to charge from 0 to 80%. For the most accurate picture, Volvo dealers can calculate the expected operating time and optimum charging solution based on customers’ activities. 

It is the ideal solution for customers in Asia looking to meet emission regulations while maintaining the same levels of productivity they have come to expect from its diesel counterpart. Numerous applications range from agriculture and landscaping through to utilities and building – with the added benefit that operators can run the machine in noise sensitive areas and out of standard hours, as well as in low-carbon projects and indoors, without the need for costly fume extraction systems.

A reservation tool for customers to order one of these machines is now open here, with delivery expected in Q3, 2022."

By Press information,2/22/2022,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/why-volvo-articulated-haulers-are-a-cut-above-the-rest/,WHY VOLVO ARTICULATED HAULERS ARE A CUT ABOVE THE REST,"From developing the first series manufactured articulated hauler more than 55 years’ ago, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is continuing to dominate the field, with articulated haulers that really pack a punch – delivering optimum performance at the lowest cost per ton.","Committed to innovation and development, Volvo CE continues to evolve its range of articulated haulers, making them even smarter, more efficient and easier to operate. Uptime is maximized too, whilst maintenance costs are kept to a minimum, reducing total cost of ownership.
EFFICIENT OPERATION WITH HAUL ASSIST
The Haul Assist suite of tools is a game-changing solution designed to get the most out of the Volvo Articulated Hauler. Powered by a 10” Volvo Co-Pilot monitor – which is available on a variety of machines from haulers and excavators to pavers – it provides valuable insight to help customers optimize the efficiency of their haul cycles and boost profitability.
A new addition to Haul Assist, the Tire Pressure Monitoring System enables monitoring of tire pressure and temperature from the comfort of the cab. Inflation pressure having a marked impact on tire wear, proactive monitoring is invaluable to optimize tire life as well as fuel efficiency, machine performance and operator comfort.
Map provides a real-time overview of the on-site traffic to help navigate around more effectively. The whereabouts of every machine and vehicle – irrespective of the type or brand – as well as visitors on site are now visible, so long as they are connected to the map application. Alongside haul roads, Map also shows load and dump zones, and flags single-lane sections, restricted zones and speed-restricted areas, helping to anticipate operating decisions and reduce unnecessary stops.
Also part of Haul Assist is On-Board Weighing, a proven tool that allows payload information to be viewed in real-time, helping to eliminate carry-back and overloading. As well as boosting productivity, this also reduces excessive fuel consumption and machine wear and tear.
SMARTER PERFORMANCE
Operator comfort has always been at the heart of design – from the centrally-positioned operator seat offering excellent visibility, through to user-friendly controls. And a range of automated functions is now offering even more support to enhance ease of operation and performance.
Terrain Memory is a handy feature of the intelligent Volvo drivetrain that identifies and remembers slippery road segments to ensure optimized traction control and off-road mobility. OptiShift enables fast and smooth directional changes, whilst Downhill Speed Control automatically maintains a constant speed when operating on downward gradients; both these, and the Cruise control function, are fitted as standard since 2019 and are available for retrofit on older haulers.
MAXIMIZING UPTIME, MINIMIZING MAINTENANCE COSTS
Not only easy to operate and highly efficient, Volvo Articulated Haulers are also designed to be easy to service. Daily or even weekly greasing is a thing of the past, required instead every 250 hours on a Volvo Articulated Hauler, the longest time interval in the industry. Add to this long engine service intervals – up to 1,000 hours on Stage V and Tier 4 Final models – and less than half the fluid volume of most of its counterparts when measured over the lifetime of the machine. The result is reduced maintenance requirements and consumables, helping to keep the machine at work while lowering maintenance costs and environmental impact.
The improvements introduced to Volvo Articulated Haulers are delivering both performance and cost advantages for customers. New work-enhancing tools and straightforward servicing are just some examples contributing towards more profitable – and sustainable – operations. All part of Volvo CE’s commitment to drive transformation in the industry and achieve its goal to have net zero value chain emissions by 2040.
Not all products are available in all markets."

The current drop in China is due to a saturated market for excavators following last year’s high sales levels and the overall slowdown in construction and infrastructure investments across the region.
In Q4, 2021, net sales increased by 5% to SEK 21,812 M (20,810 M). Adjusted for currency movements net sales increased by 2%, of which net sales of machines were flat and service sales increased by 14%. Primarily impacted by the decline in the Chinese market, global order intake decreased by 24% and deliveries decreased by 18% for the final quarter.
For the full year 2021, net sales amounted to SEK 92,031 M – rising from SEK 81,453 M from last year and demonstrating that the global market is continuing to spring back from the initial hit caused by the disruptions of 2020. Adjusted for operating income, it increased to SEK 12,228 M (10,071), corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 13.3% (12.4%).
Market development
The European market showed a continuation of solid growth (27%) with a high level of infrastructure investments and a recovery in the rental segment. North America’s growth (23%) was supported by investments in commercial real estate and strong housing construction, while South America’s increase of 65% was largely driven by a high demand for commodities. The world’s biggest construction equipment market of China, however, reported a drop of 1% while all other regions in Asia, particularly in Korea and Southeast Asia, continued its rising market development of 19%.
A sustainable outlook
The final months of 2021 saw the first shipment of the 20-ton EC230 Electric excavator for the Asian market from the factory in South Korea – setting yet another milestone for Volvo CE’s electric future. Sales of the company’s compact electric machines, the ECR25 Electric excavator and the L25 Electric wheel loader, continued across key markets with Volvo CE delivering 321 of these machines in the last year. The reveal of a new concept autonomous electric wheel loader, Volvo LX03, also showcased the company’s direction towards decarbonization.
“The industry continues to be confronted by the effects of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in combination with additional challenges such as transport disruptions, global component shortages and an overwhelmed supply chain,” says Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE.
“Yet thanks to the dedicated work of my colleagues, partners and suppliers, we have continued to deliver good profitability and took several important steps forward in our efforts to lead the transition to a carbon-neutral construction industry. The greater flexibility, digitalization and innovation across our products and services – not forgetting the stringent targets we have set ourselves in building a better world – have contributed towards a solid performance for 2021.”

The Electric Worksite (E-Worksite), which launched earlier this year in Gothenburg, Sweden, not only sets the global benchmark for electric jobsites but also tests electric machines’ specific requirements across different tasks within a demanding urban environment. It is a vital next step in the manufacturer’s electrification journey and a testament to its commitment to achieving net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, as validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.
Carolina Diez Ferrer, Head of Advanced Engineering Programs, at Volvo CE, says: “We are already delivering electric solutions that offer zero exhaust emissions, reduced noise, and a much more comfortable work environment, but that is only half the challenge. We are committed to also helping our customers reach their own climate goals through complete site solutions with a holistic sustainable approach. This exciting partnership allows for a comprehensive investigation into the varied infrastructure and support system needs for electric machines to really perform to their best, no matter the task at hand.”
“We are committed to also helping our customers reach their own climate goals through complete site solutions with a holistic sustainable approach” says Carolina Diez Ferrer, here at one of the construction sites in Gothenburg, Färjenäsparken.
Innovation powered by partnership
E-Worksite is a long-running research project that explores the site requirements for electromobility over the next two years across a variety of different applications. It has now completed the development of a new recreation area within the major city park Färjenäsparken and is currently working on the redesign of the Drottningtorget city square, both in the heart of Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden. Here, the customer transformation from diesel machines into more sustainable environmental solutions is guided by a fully holistic exploration of every aspect of site management. The project is funded by the Swedish Energy Agency, with Volvo CE working in close collaboration with Gothenburg City, NCC, Gothenburg Energy, Lindholmen Science Park, Chalmers University of Technology and ABB Electrification Sweden, among many others to conduct a largescale machine demonstration in Gothenburg.
Peter Lindgren, Business Developer Electrified Transports at the City of Gothenburg Urban Transport Administration, says: “To achieve the City of Gothenburg’s climate goals we need to reduce greenhouse gases and we see that electric construction machines will help us in this environmental work by reducing local emissions of both nitrogen oxides and particles, as well as noise. The partnership as part of the Electric Worksite is of great value and we see that this research project has the capacity required to speed up our green transformation”.
In the heart of Gothenburg, Sweden’s second largest city, is the central square Drottningtorget where the L25 electric is being put to the test, offering zero exhaust emissions, reduced noise, and a much more comfortable work environment.
In this first phase, a number of electric machines already available to buy on the market are being put to the test, including the L25 Electric wheel loader and ECR25 Electric excavator, which are carrying out minor construction work, material moving and landscaping. A larger 30-tonne grid-connected excavator will be tasked with more energy-demanding jobs at different construction sites, to start in spring next year.
No one size fits all
Project planners are answering questions such as how to ensure best value for money for customers and what are the most energy efficient methods of supplying electricity to power the machines. Beyond the technology itself, business models, infrastructure and support systems, regulatory frameworks and a mindset change are all required on the road to full acceptance. It is a complex puzzle to solve as there will be no one size fits all. The findings will prove important not only for municipalities in deciding how to develop the appropriate legislation, but also for industry partners in bringing technical solutions to market – both in the immediate future and over the next two decades.
“We want to collectively take on the complex task of understanding the electric ecosystem and guide our customers on how best to move forward in this transition” says Niklas Lindblom, Project Manager at Advanced Engineering Programs, Volvo CE. “Through this partnership we will be connecting all parts of the customer value chain in order to build up shared knowledge and innovation capabilities to ensure our electric future is fit for any construction challenge.”
The L25 Electric offers zero exhaust emissions and low noise.
Launching the project in an urban application allows for a demonstration of the advantages electric machines bring to city life – low noise, low emissions and a much more peaceful environment for society in general."

And the machines are certainly getting the thumbs up from operators.,"Never one to do things by halves, Germany’s largest municipal waste management company, BSR, is leading the way with the purchase of nine Volvo L25 Electric wheel loaders. The 5-ton electric machines are being put through their paces across several BSR sites in the Berlin metropolitan area, helping the city keep its streets and sidewalks clean and clear, pushing waste from the city’s 26,000 garbage bins into boxes and transferring the waste to compacting containers. In the winter, the machines are also helping with the important role of keeping Berlin’s roads free of snow and ice, loading de-icing salt and gravel for the city’s grit spreaders.
With full power and the wide bucket, wet autumn leaves are no match for the L25 Electric wheel loader
Arvid Rüster, Product Manager at BSR, comments: “We saw the Volvo L25 Electric wheel loader at the 2019 Bauma trade fair in Munich and were immediately impressed with it. No noise, no exhaust fumes, no particulate matter. We had to order some!”
Rüster is a Product Manager responsible for sweeping and construction machinery in BSR’s fleet of around 1,800 vehicles and machines. The fleet includes everything from cars and vans to refuse trucks and sweepers, and even encompasses wheel loaders, bulldozers and excavators. Some 230 of these machines are already electric-powered, among them are waste collection vehicles with fuel-assisted electric drives, which BSR put into service via the German Ministry of Transport’s ‘Clean Air’ program. This is also the case for the nine L25 Electric wheel loaders. In this way, the federal government bears much of the additional cost for the electric drive.
Kai Groth, Head of BSR’s Product Management department, believes that ongoing political support and subsidies are important to make electrification of fleets economically viable in the long-term, without the need to raise waste disposal charges in Berlin. Groth is anticipating longer usage times, lower operating costs and less maintenance for the electric wheel loaders.

Berlin is fit for the future
Electromobility has been on the radar at BSR for some time and the company has been developing an intelligent network of charging infrastructure since 2018. Today, a variety of electric vehicles, electric transporters and the new L25 Electric wheel loaders can dock with their On Board charger and recharge sufficiently overnight. In addition, BSR has purchased external fast chargers for the L25 Electric wheel loaders, which enable the machines to be charged from 0 – 100% at 400V in just two hours.
“The L25 Electric wheel loader has a battery capacity of 40 kWh, and this is sufficient for us. The machines are rarely in use for more than one or two hours a day, so they still have enough remaining capacity”, assures Rüster.
It was the ease of operation and intuitive interface, however, that were the deciding factors for Rüster. Not every depot has permanent staff, and it is imperative that the BSR operators are able to operate the all-electric wheel loaders. Around 60 employees have received instruction on the new technology, and all are impressed by its performance. The operators are particularly enthusiastic about how much quieter their working days are with the near-silent operation of the L25 Electric wheel loader and can no longer imagine switching back to a diesel alternative.

Quiet yet powerful
Nico Ast, a BSR employee for 21 years, has already made friends with the L25 Electric wheel loader and is really putting it through its paces this Autumn, pushing wet, heavy leaves together with the 1.8 m wide wheel loader bucket.
Ast says: “Pushing leaves really shows off its power. The L25 Electric wheel loader is stronger than and superior to its diesel brother.” It is quieter and quicker to respond, he adds. The joystick control is also very sensitive. The only thing he still needs to get used to is just how quiet the whirring of the electric motor is. “Given a choice, I would always opt for the electric wheel loader,” the experienced BSR operator says.
When the work is done, Ast heads for one of the 14 charging points at the BSR headquarters in Berlin Tempelhof and in just a few simple steps he connects the L25 Electric wheel loader to the power socket for recharging, so the machine is ready to go again tomorrow.
While electric machines require less servicing than their traditional counterparts, they do need servicing, which is where the specialist expertise of dealer, Swecon Baumaschinen GmbH comes in and the service department in Berlin is well prepared for all service requests.

This week's tests at SCA's timber terminal in Torsboda, Sweden, have demonstrated that it is possible to tele-operate a Volvo L180 High-lift wheel loader, hundreds of kilometers away. And by using a closed 5G network, low latency has proven to be a major advantage – allowing operators to perform the sensitive process of picking, loading and organizing logs remotely.
Tele-operated forestry is expected to deliver improved productivity by allowing one operator to work across multiple – and sometimes isolated – sites around the world. It is also expected to make it both safer, by removing humans from potentially hazardous environments, and more sustainable, through more efficient logistics flows as the loading and unloading of timber can also be done during the night.
Christian Spjutare, Advanced Engineering Program Manager at Volvo CE, says: “We expect tele-operation to open up far greater opportunities for operators than is currently available. Sometimes it can be difficult to hire people in timber terminals because of their remote locations. But tele-operation allows people to work from any location, no matter the distance, making it a more desirable work setting, with the added advantage of more efficient and sustainable work logistics.”
Magnus Leonhardt, Director, Head of Business Development & Innovation at Telia adds: “This partnership is a fine example of how remote control with the latest technology can contribute to more efficient and sustainable construction solutions in the forestry industry. A secure and robust digital infrastructure is crucial for this. The unique technical qualities that 5G offers are also entirely critical, in which extremely quick response times and high capacity enable immediate feedback between operator and machine, which is a prerequisite for being able to safely control machines remotely.”
With a 5G network the response time is extremely low and the high capacity enables immediate feedback.
Remote precision in its grasp
An important aim of this research project is to explore exactly what is required from an operator perspective in making tele-operation a user-friendly and efficient experience. Because each load of timber can be so varied – from an unwieldly pile of heavy logs through to just a few short pieces of wood – it is vital that the lifting process is carried out with pinpoint accuracy and incredibly precise handling.
As a result, there are currently a number of connected cameras and sensors located at strategic points around the machine that transmit real-time data via the Telia 5G network back to the control station. The test will therefor both explore how to mature the technology and gather vital feedback from the operators on the optimum placement of those cameras for handling precision.
Feedback from operators is vital for developing the tele-operation system. Here, from the control station at Torsboda Timber terminal.
Volvo CE has for the past few years been exploring the potential for tele-operation across a variety of segments from mining to urban construction, with this project testing the technology in its most challenging application yet. By remote-controlling processes like timber lifting – which are currently too complex to be fully automated – tele-operation becomes an important enabler for automation, allowing for a more gradual integration of automated processes for customers.
“This research project gives us an opportunity to test our teleoperation platform in a new application with high precision requirements and learn how the system needs to be designed to meet industry needs. Insights from partial manual and tele-operated management enables us to also take steps towards automation in more complex processes”, Christian concludes.
Remote Timber is financed by the participating parties and by VINNOVA’s vehicle strategic research and innovation (FFI) program."

Collaborative machines
The prototype LX03 has been built by a dedicated team of engineers, programmers and workshop technicians from Volvo CE sites in Eskilstuna, Sweden and Konz, Germany, in collaboration with the design team in Gothenburg, Sweden. It is a 5-ton wheel loader that has been developed as a modular concept, with the capability of being made larger or smaller with just one or two changes to the manufacturing process. It also shares its driveline with the L25 Electric, making it a zero emission, low-noise machine with a runtime of up to eight hours depending on its application.
It is designed to be a smart and safe worker, equipped with a brain that has the capacity to adapt to different scenarios, make decisions in real-time and most importantly collaborate with humans. It can be programmed by customers to complete heavy, repetitive or dangerous tasks, reducing the need for a human on site.
Insights from the testing of the Volvo prototype LX03 will feed into applications for today and tomorrow.

After several years of high demand for construction equipment in China, orders in the market there have declined by 26% as reduced government investments has led to lower construction activity. This has been more than offset by a good development in Europe, North America and other parts of the world. Order intake remains stable on a high level.
Net sales in the third quarter increased by 11% to SEK 19,638 M, from SEK 17,619 M in 2020. When adjusted for currency movements they were also up by 11% in the same period, of which net sales of machines increased by 11% and service sales by 13% - reflecting Volvo CE’s increased focus on services. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 2,635 M, compared to SEK 1,963 M in the same quarter 2020 and corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 13.4% (11.1%).
Despite a continued rise in interest for Volvo branded products across all other regions, order intake for Q3 remained flat, though still high. Together with a 9% reduction in deliveries, this is largely driven by the sudden decline in the China market.
Market Development
Across both the European and the North American markets, demand has remained high – the latter thanks to high infrastructure investments and housing construction activity. Asia, excluding China, showed good improvements particularly across South Korea and South East Asia. Continuing uncertainty across market forecasts remains significant due to the inability to predict supply chain capacity and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “Despite industry-wide challenges of supply and delivery constraints, the power of Volvo CE as a truly global leader is clear to see in today’s quarterly results. While sales in China have dipped, the strength of sales in other regions has ensured we have remained at peak performance. This quarter has also demonstrated our leading focus on sustainable power, with several exciting launches and events, ensuring we keep a strong focus on building a brighter future.”
With the launch of three new electric compact machines and the reveal of the world’s first fossil-free steel prototype vehicle this quarter, Volvo CE is now not only the manufacturer with the largest range of commercially available electric machines, but is also taking big strides forward in accelerating more sustainable products, services and processes across the supply chain. In India, the company also launched 16 new machines all of which are engineered to the new CEV 4 emission norms.

During today’s green steel collaboration event, it was announced that more vehicles will follow in 2022 in what will be a series of concept vehicles and components using fossil-free steel from SSAB.","The machine, a load carrier for use in mining and quarrying, was unveiled at a green steel collaboration event today, October 13, in Gothenburg hosted by Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, and Martin Lundstedt, President and CEO Volvo Group. During the premiere, which was broadcasted online and is available to watch here, attendees got to see the world’s first machine made of fossil-free steel. In addition, insights about yet another ground-breaking sustainable steel collaboration were shared. EU commissioner for internal market, Thierry Breton, and the Swedish minister of enterprise and innovation, Ibrahim Baylan, joined the event together with Martin Lindqvist, CEO SSAB and other speakers.
Melker Jernberg says: “Our ambition is to have fossil-free steel used across all our products, with a step-by-step approach. This machine is proof that we really can make fast progress, when we work together in strong partnerships, when we are determined to act and we enable our skilled people to contribute to building the world we want to live in. Not only for our generation, but for generations to come. Our team in Braås is understandably proud to help make this innovation happen.”
“This initiative with SSAB sets the benchmark for a fossil-free future. Just as the nations of the world come together at COP26 to address climate change, so too must organizations and industries work in collaboration to develop innovative new solutions for a greenhouse gas emission free future. Volvo Group is committed to pioneering partnerships such as this with SSAB to develop attractive, safe and efficient new vehicles and machines that pave the way for a more sustainable transport and infrastructure system adopted for the future,” says Martin Lundstedt, President and CEO Volvo Group.
With a commitment to be climate-neutral and achieve net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, Volvo Group is on the path towards developing sustainable transport and infrastructure solutions of the future. Along with the electrification of its vehicles and machines, Volvo is determined to reduce the carbon footprint of its entire supply chain and this latest innovation is one step forward on this path.
“Having the world´s first actual vehicle made using SSAB´s fossil-free steel is a true milestone. Our collaboration with Volvo Group shows that green transition is possible and brings results,” says Martin Lindqvist, President and CEO at SSAB. “Together, we will continue reducing climate impact all the way to the end customer while ensuring that our customers get high-quality steel. We look forward to continuing to work with Volvo Group in research and development to produce more fossil-free steel products.”
A move toward green steel is an important step for Volvo Group, as well as for the transport and infrastructure industries as a whole, particularly considering that around 70% of a truck’s weight comes from steel and cast iron, with the figure for Volvo machines even higher. This first concept machine, produced at Volvo CE’s facility in Braås, is just the start, with smaller-scale series production planned by 2022, and mass production set to follow."

Proven past, electric future


The new electric machines are now available for reserving online
The L20 Electric compact wheel loader and EC18 Electric and ECR18 Electric compact excavators join the already launched L25 Electric and ECR25 Electric. The two existing models are already established on the market and are proving to bring power and performance in a more environmentally sensitive package. The three new models represent the latest additions to Volvo CE’s industry-first commitment to move its range of Volvo branded compact wheel loaders and compact excavators to electric and stop development of new diesel variants. 

The L20 Electric is a proven concept based on the larger L25 Electric model. It features a 1.8-ton payload and a parallel-type linkage offering great visibility over the attachment being used, outstanding lifting height, as well as 100% parallel movements – making it a perfect fit for fork applications too. Expected to deliver up to six hours of active work per charge, the electric machine comes with a choice of battery pack (33kWh or 40kWh) and reduces maintenance by 30%. As well as the more peaceful working conditions offered by its near-silence, operating comfort is also enhanced thanks to the new automatic park brake with hill-hold functionality and a range of customizable work modes.

The short but tough 1.8-ton ECR18 Electric is set to provide the same best-in-class stability and operator experience customers expect from its diesel counterpart but with the benefit of low noise, low vibration and more responsive hydraulics due to the immediate torque. Delivering an anticipated four hours of active work per charge, depending on the environment and task in hand, the ECR18 Electric also benefits from an ultra-short tail radius (perfect for confined spaces). It has been built with durability in mind – from its high profile counterweight to all-round steel panels and hoses routed inside the boom.

Easy to operate and transport, the nimble EC18 Electric offers customers a cost-efficient compact excavator working in 1.8-ton applications. Its variable undercarriage retracts to less than 1m and expands up to 1.35m, allowing it to squeeze into the tightest of areas, while the machine’s design ensures the right frame corner, swing post and cylinder stay within the tracks’ width, resulting in maximum visibility and a reduced risk of machine damage when working alongside obstacles. As well as ergonomic controls, a spacious cab and a range of customizable settings, it also offers the option of an enclosed and heated cab.

All three machines come with an integrated on-board charger allowing them to charge from 0 to 100% in under six hours. With an optional fast off-board charger, the L20 Electric will fully charge in under just two hours, while the ECR18 Electric and EC18 Electric will charge up to 80% in up to 1.25 hours. For the most accurate picture, Volvo dealers can calculate the expected operating time and optimum charging solution based on customers’ activities. With any of these machines, customers can operate in noise sensitive areas and out of standard hours, as well as low-carbon projects and indoors, without the need for costly fume extraction systems. 

Smart solutions for smart machines
EMMA will provide insights to help manage the electric machines efficiently
EMMA will provide insights to help manage the electric machines efficiently Customers of any of the five electric models will also soon be able to take advantage of a new fleet management solution designed specifically for the remote monitoring of electric machines. The Electric Machine Management Application (EMMA) will provide valuable insights into battery level and remaining working hours, charging status, geographic location and much more to help customers boost uptime.

As with the first electric models introduced in 2019 and brought to market in 2020, Volvo CE now has available a reservation tool for customers to order one of these three new machines, available across 12 European countries before expanding to other markets. Customers placing an online reservation by December 31 2021 will receive an extra gift – one Volvo bucket free of charge for ordering the L20 Electric and two Volvo buckets free of charge for ordering either the ECR18 Electric or EC18 Electric.

The CX01 concept utilizes one vibratory asphalt compactor drum that’s actually two independent halves (called a split-drum) kept upright by a self-balancing control system. Capable of being operated either by remote-control or entirely autonomously, the machine is also fitted with both a diesel engine and an energy storage system, making it a flexible electric hybrid solution. It can be operated in diesel-only, hybrid or fully electric modes.
Proving Volvo CE’s capacity for innovation across a variety of segments, this concept machine is the latest in the Concept Lab family of prototype machines that push the boundaries of conventional construction equipment.
“While the CX01 is a conceptual product, the research and development that have gone into it will benefit customers in other ways,” said Justin Zupanc, Head of the Asphalt Compaction Development Team, Volvo CE. “It’s exciting for our engineers to push themselves to develop new and innovative ideas, and we’ve had personnel from the U.S. and Europe involved in the design, build and test phases of this concept.”
Customer-centered design
The CX01 concept provides an opportunity to fundamentally rethink the paving process to address customer needs, both improving the conditions for the operator and increasing productivity. By redesigning the compactors themselves, the operator is removed from the unit — reducing exposure to vibration, noise, dust and other associated environmental conditions — and freed up to autonomously control a fleet of CX units working together to compact asphalt surfaces.
A fleet of these units deployed on larger jobs could work together and communicate not only between each CX unit but also to other pieces of equipment on the site. The machines could survey the jobsite, report on the conditions of the mat — things like density, temperature and passes — and determine when and where to compact.
Compaction cycles can be streamlined, costs reduced and more agile work patterns set up, thanks to the machine’s compact design and precise maneuverability. Rolling pattern, weight and number of rollers can all easily be adjusted to match the width, thickness and speed of paving operation — providing a complete paving solution for whatever the job might be, from light infrastructure to highway construction. The CX01 can be matched with Volvo’s existing Co-Pilot system so that all work can be handled remotely via a touchscreen interface. In addition, it uses GPS position tracking to monitor job performance and help customers better hit their productivity targets.
While the CX01 concept has been purely an exploration, some learnings could be applied to future products.
“Remote control and autonomous operations are areas of focus for us in R&D. Also, while the low-friction water reduction coating on the drum shell is theoretical, it could be a huge benefit on larger machines to decrease the amount of water needed,” Zupanc said. “It is exciting to think how the theories showcased on the CX01 could be realized on compaction production units in the future.”
Attendees of The Utility Expo in Louisville have an opportunity to see the CX01 compactor concept up close in the Volvo booth, K129 , and a machine walkaround will be held Sept. 28 as part of the company’s virtual experience ."

In an audacious engineering challenge set by Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) in collaboration with the LEGO Group, young people from around the world united to take on this fiendishly difficult task.","Devised by engineering experts from both Volvo CE and the LEGO Group, the challenge was proposed to a dedicated team of young robotics students from FIRST® LEGO® League teams, to move the world’s biggest articulated hauler, the Volvo A60H – a 43 ton hauler loaded with an extra 45 tons of rocks – across a distance of 50 meters, using only LEGO Technic® elements. In a bid to showcase the incredible potential of STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) brainpower, it was not a task that could be easily solved.
Yet earlier this year via a nailbiting livestream, that same team of 35 budding engineers watched nervously from all corners of the world to see if the clever solution they had spent hours of deliberation on would succeed. And it did. Using a total of 728,168 LEGO® Technic pieces connected together under a layer of steel plates and transmitting signals to 1,920 motors, the children created enough power on their rolling motorized grid to pull the machine’s six heavy-duty wheels across the required distance in just 30 minutes.
Frida Jönsson, Engineer at Volvo CE, who has been involved in the scheme from the very start, says: “The students showed incredible resilience and tenacity. In total they spent more than 2,000 hours of their own time to come up with a hard-fought solution that could create a pulling force of 10,000 Newtons in order to get the hauler moving.
“Despite their plans very literally turning to ashes on the first attempt (when a fire broke out forcing them back to the drawing board) the teams showed that with collaboration, teamwork and a good dose of creativity, you can always find a way to succeed. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t moved to tears by the pride and sheer joy you could see from the teams when they realized their hard work had paid off.”
Remote working was no barrier for the budding engineers to solve the MOVE IT challenge
In for the long haul
Over three months, four teams of children from all backgrounds all over the world – US, Sweden, Japan and Nigeria – collaborated across time zones, language barriers and a distance of 32,000 kilometers to work on this engineering challenge. Each team was sent the 2,193-piece LEGO® Technic model version of the real Volvo A60H articulated hauler and given 12 weeks to find a way to build a prototype LEGO® Technic model that could be strong enough to move the 43-ton heavyweight. And just to make the task even harder, an extra 45 tons of rocks were added to the machine.
The robust A60H, which loads 34 cubic meters and is durable enough to carry 55 tons, is used to hauling heavy loads in the most challenging of off-road conditions. But on this occasion, it was simply along for the ride.
At a time when getting a good network during a video conferencing call seems enough of a challenge, this team of young geniuses proved that remote working is no barrier to being able to brainstorm ideas and come to a viable solution.
“Our aim is to stimulate a love of STEM and showcase that there really is no limit to what the next generation of engineers can achieve if they put their minds together,” says Arvid Rinaldo, Brand Partnership at Volvo CE. “Using only online discussions, these incredibly smart people were able to solve our challenge without even meeting in person. We had set out to educate and motivate young people, but knowing how to solve complicated tasks like this without ever seeing each other is something we all need to learn in business and something they demonstrated with ease.”
The final set-up was viewed remotely by the team of young people around the world
They worked so well in fact that engineers had to increase the difficulty level of the challenge halfway through. Libor Udržal, Master Builder and Engineer at LEGO Group  says: “We actually had to put an additional 45 tons of rocks inside the hauler to make it more of a challenge! The motors in the LEGO Technic®  6x6 Volvo Articulated Hauler set are designed to move a weight around 3.6 kg but the hauler weighs over 11,000 times more than this. Even with my 20 years of experience, I would have felt daunted by the task in hand.”
This is not the first time the two major Scandinavian brands have teamed up with children to help solve engineering questions. Youngsters also played a vital role in the creation of an autonomous concept wheel loader back in 2018.

The Volvo CE team from Sweden and South Korea has worked closely with Finnish company Norrhydro in the research project, leveraging an idea initially born out of academic collaborations. Today, the innovation has matured into a real-world solution with ongoing customer trials in the field and it is expected to accelerate the introduction of e-mobility across Volvo CE’s larger excavator platform. The company anticipates the new technology to be available in the excavator market in a near future.
“This innovation enables Volvo CE to offer its customers a truly unique electro-hydraulic solution, pushing fuel efficiency to new levels. It’s demonstrating the passion of our engineers to bring forward customer-oriented solutions and systems that will drive the transformation towards net-zero emissions operations. Also, it’s again an example of our strength working in partnerships and achieving amazing results”, says Lars Stenqvist, CTO Volvo Group.
How it works
The innovation enables new ways to reduce energy losses in hydraulics. In the new system architecture all the machine's work functions are connected to a hydraulic energy storage via a common pressure rail, comprised by two or more pressure lines. The energy storage, which consists of hydraulic accumulators, enables energy-efficient recovery of kinetic energy and peak power supply. For cylinder-driven functions, so-called “smart actuators” are used to achieve energy-efficient conversion from hydraulic power to a variable force and speed. The system also allows energy recovery and performance increase of the machine's rotating loads, such as the swing function through the introduction of variable hydraulic machines. Thanks to greatly reduced energy losses and the power contribution from hydraulic accumulators, a smaller power source can be used and the need for cooling is reduced. With a higher available power, cycle times can be shortened, for example when loading a truck, which contributes to both efficiency increases and cost benefits for the customer.
“We are really proud of this recognition, which we share with our collaboration partners”, says Kim Heybroek, Volvo CE Emerging Technologies Research Engineer and a member of the winning team. “The potential in the innovation has been a strong driver for us in the project, making it an exciting journey to be part of, as we see the significant benefits it will offer for our customers and help build the world we want to live in.”
The Volvo Technology Award is a mark of recognition for outstanding technical advances that contribute to the enhancement of the Volvo Group’s high-tech competitiveness and technological expertise. Previous recipients have included world-famous innovations such as the Duo-Prop marine drive, the City Filter used to purify trucks and bus exhausts, Volvo’s side airbags (SIPS) and the Electric Site emission free quarry research project.

Battery electric and fuel cell electric products form a major part of this ambition. But if we want to reduce our environmental impact and build the world we want to live in, there are many more factors to consider.","Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has a commitment to reach net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Developing battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric technology will go a long way to deliver on that ambition, but for a construction company today, there is much more to do to drive industry change. Let’s look at some of the other significant actions that are required on our collective journey to a carbon neutral future.
1. GET EVERYONE ON THE CARBON REDUCTION PATHWAY
“Perhaps the biggest hurdle ahead for us humans lies in changing mindsets. Combating climate change is not only about advancements in technology. We all need to do this together, think differently and change our behaviors and ways of working,” explains Niklas Nillroth, Head of Sustainability and Public Affairs at Volvo CE.
Once a niche responsibility area, carbon reduction efforts now need to be the responsibility of each individual across an organization’s value chain with all parties having an important role to play. At Volvo CE, an inclusive culture and shared ownership form a foundation to driving that change, with employees educated and encouraged to think about how their actions impact the carbon footprint, and how they can make a real difference, big or small. Empowerment like this will accelerate change.
“Climate change is real and one of the greatest challenges of our time. As a world leading manufacturer, we not only have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, we also have the clear vision, determination and talents to drive this transformation that is so urgently needed now. The choices we make today will form the world tomorrow – and we choose to act,” concludes Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. 
2. TAKE ACTION ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH A CIRCULAR APPROACH
Manufacturing is one of the largest single emitters of greenhouse gases in Europe, responsible for some 880 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents a year. As part of its Science Based Targets goals, Volvo CE has set itself the challenge to reduce CO2 emissions in its own operations by 50% by 2030. We know that reducing our vehicles’ emissions through electric solutions is integral to our carbon neutral ambitions, but we cannot forget the importance of our manufacturing processes.
A circular economy approach will be vital here to shift from the linear ‘take, make, waste’ production and consumption model to a more sustainable value chain that designs out waste and pollution, bolsters competitive agility and drives new value. As well as incorporating recycled components for parts supply and manufacturing, Volvo Reman solution is focused on extending and optimizing the life of its machines by refurbishing and refining them to deliver like-new service. The end goal being to deliver a truly circular vehicle or machine that uses renewable energy efficiently, is built without waste, has maximum uptime and an optimal lifespan.
The circular economy approach for sustainable construction manufacturing
3. LEVERAGE THE POWER OF PARTNERSHIPS
Real transformation requires a more cohesive, cooperative way of thinking. As Brunno Muller, Head of Advanced Manufacturing Engineering and Research at Volvo CE, says: “We cannot build the future we want by ourselves. We need to consider how we do this end-to-end, joining forces with partners and sharing experiences.”
Whether that’s working with customers on test pilots to consistently improve the power of new technologies and products, through to collaborating with suppliers to source the best, most sustainable parts and processes, we need to partner with a range of groups from across our business and supply chain if we are to accelerate sustainable solutions. All actors in society need to come together - corporations, academia, policy-makers, and municipality leaders - to accelerate in important areas such as technology adaption, infrastructure and legislative transformation. With our combined expertise, we will be best placed to find new ways of working and to accelerate the changes needed for our carbon neutral future.
4. USE DATA TO DELIVER ON SUSTAINABILITY GOALS
According to a recent report by the World Economic Forum, most of the data in the world (90%) was generated in the last two years. Harnessing the full power of this data is the challenge. With more than 150,000 connected vehicles and machines, Volvo CE is using the data it collects from customers across the globe to deliver improvements in safety, uptime and fuel efficiency, for today and tomorrow. New digital services, like Efficient Load Out, are making it possible for trucks and excavators to communicate more effectively with one another on the job site. By doing so it ensures trucks only depart for their destination once a goal weight has been reached, thereby reducing the number of trips and in turn reducing the associated emissions.
The connected solutions we have made available today, and those that we are working on for tomorrow, allow our machines to operate in the most sustainable way possible. All of these incremental improvements combine to deliver energy efficiencies across all types of machines, whether they are electric or not – a vital step forward in our ongoing journey towards a carbon neutral future."
By Press Information,8/4/2021,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2021/six-seemingly-small-ways-to-make-a-big-impact/,SIX SEEMINGLY SMALL WAYS TO MAKE A BIG IMPACT,"Connected solutions are getting smarter by the day. While you are working hard on the job site, hundreds of thousands of data points are doing their own job quietly in the background to allow you to work more safely, efficiently and sustainably than ever before.","Electric machines may be the face of our net-zero future, but when it comes to a more sustainable way of working the real heart of a construction site is the connectivity that is filtering the numbers, pumping out vital information to every part of the site and keeping operations flowing smoothly. Being part of this digital ecosystem is not only a vital tool to achieving our goal of building a better world, by unlocking efficiencies right across the value chain, but also allows for more effective communication in our individual roles. We are only just scratching the surface of what technology can achieve, but let’s look at some of the most recent innovations significantly contributing to increased safety, uptime and fuel efficiency.
Prevent downtime with virtual real-time tech support
To diagnose and resolve potential machine issues even faster than before, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is enabling dealer field technicians to connect directly to their back office product specialists, as well as Volvo product experts and engineers, through live augmented reality video feeds. Via a Real-time Tech Support app on their mobile phone, field technicians can initiate an interactive video call with their dealer back-office staff and invite a Volvo product expert and engineer, if required, to provide more expertise in diagnosing and resolving an issue. Preventing frustrating downtime for the customer and multiple visits to the jobsite for field technicians, this new support speeds up fault-tracing, minimizes travel and gets the machine back on the job much sooner.
2. Reduce transport emission with efficient loading
As part of a new digital service called Efficient Load Out, trucks and excavators are now able to communicate more effectively with each other on the job site, increasing the efficiency of their work flow and therefore reducing transport emissions. After successful field tests with construction company NCC, a first for this type of service, it proved possible to secure between 96% and 100% load utilization for each transport, compared to the typical 87%. Data shows that 350,000 tons have been excavated and transported in 11,000 trips during the pilot run. The connected process helped reduce the number of trips by 1,600 – and it’s expected to save around 8,000 transports once the whole project is completed. When both excavator operators and truck drivers are logged in to the system, a notification alerts the excavator operator when there is a truck available for loading nearby. During the loading process, the excavator measures the weight of the load to the most accurate degree and only once the goal weight is reached, is the truck driver told to drive to its specific destination. There is also significant value in being able to access all load data through the cloud based portal – allowing for convenient monitoring to ensure the project delivers on time. And without the need for administrators to manage this process, it allows for a significant cost saving.
3. Automated grading for double the productivity
The perfect grade is in reach with an ingenius machine control system that automates boom and bucket movements to achieve the exact depth and angle at the touch of a button. Volvo Active Control boosts digging accuracy allowing jobs to be completed up to 45% faster. With single-lever grading, the arm speed is manually adjusted by the operator while the machine automatically adjusts boom and bucket movements to maintain an even grade and create the desired shape. The steer-by-wire solution can also easily set swing fence, height limit and depth limit to avoid contact with side obstacles, overhead obstacles such as power lines, and underground hazards such as pipes and cables. All of which not only helps operators be more productive behind the wheel, but also makes construction sites that much safer. 
4. Stay on top of fleet management
It’s easy for fleet managers to become overwhelmed by the mass of data being produced by modern construction machines. What good are all these numbers if it’s not easy to make sense of them and take actionable insights to improve the work environment? Volvo ACTIVE CARE has been rolled out globally to proactively take on the burden of monitoring and reporting machine health, freeing customers to get on with the job in hand. It is an intelligent telematics service that bundles together the monitoring of machine health and the provision of weekly reports that together help reduce downtime. Remote analysis delivers multiple benefits, including catching problems before they become failures and helping smooth service scheduling. By knowing what the problem is, dealer technicians need to make fewer trips to the customer site and arrive with the right tools, parts and expertise to increase the opportunity for a first visit fix. This all amounts to increased uptime and reduced cost for the customer.
5. Get the full view with 3D modelling
Volvo CE’s Dig Assist machine control application for excavators has been updated with new features that make it even faster and easier to create plans and put more information at operators’ fingertips – raising the bar once again on productivity, efficiency and safety in digging operations. Via the Dig Assist app on the Volvo Co-Pilot interface, operators can choose from 2D, In-Field Design and 3D tools right from the comfort of the cab. While the 2D app is intended for site levelling and profiling slopes, and the In-Field Design option allows operators to go from a paper drawing to a digital excavation model in minutes via GNSS and RTK navigation technology, it is the 3D option that is the ideal choice for complex and larger infrastructure projects. Providing full three-dimensional functionality, Topcon 3D-MC and Trimble Earthworks for Dig Assist allow designs to be uploaded directly into the Volvo Co-Pilot – this ability to offer both solutions is unique to Volvo. Simply import a project file and get to work.
6. Reach the next level with gamified Operator Training
An app which helps operators make small but important improvements every time is taking its cue from the world of gaming. Operator Coaching forms part of the Load Assist family and is now available in select markets across the world. The latest upgrade gives operators of Volvo’s L110H to L260H wheel loaders real-time information so that they can better understand how their actions influence output. A bit like chasing a top score on a computer game, the new feature allows operators to set targets and objectives for continual performance improvement. Even experienced and proficient operators benefit from the advantages of the new app, as early adopters have reported that it helps them to see their behaviour reflected back in a non-judgemental way, to analyze their productivity from a pure efficiency standpoint and then to suggest areas of improvement they would never have considered before. Operator Coaching is just one example of how gaming trends are influencing the world of construction."

With improved construction activity, high customer confidence and increased investment in infrastructure, order intake has also increased by 35%. Total net sales in the second quarter increased by 13% amounting to SEK 25,839 M (SEK 22,876 M in Q2 2020) – supported by a 17% rise in the sales of services. Adjusted for currency movements, however, net sales increased by 21%. Sales in Asia, including China, the world’s largest construction equipment market, remained the highest but still accounted for a 12% drop, due to a decline in infrastructure investment. Asia (excluding China) continued to solidify its growth with improvements in all key markets including India, Korea and South East Asia. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 3,374 M, up slightly from 3,108 M last year, corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 13.1% (13.6%).
Thanks to a more confident customer outlook and increased investment across most markets, order intake increased by 35% with a significant increase in orders for Volvo branded products and a more modest yet stable order intake in SDLG branded products, affected as they were by the slowdown in the Chinese market. Demand for large and medium sized machines remained strong and higher than for compact machines. Due in large part to higher sales in Europe and North and South America, the latter of which saw a 120% increase in deliveries from the same period last year, overall deliveries increased by 5% in Q2.
Market development
The year up to May has benefited from high customer activity across industry segments, more than positively impacted by increasing volumes in the European, North American and South American markets. In Europe, the majority of countries continued their recovery to see a 30% increase measured in units from the same period last year, while North America saw a 35% rise thanks to high infrastructure and housing construction activity. The South American market enjoyed the biggest surge (71%) due to an increased demand in commodities. Despite its strong start to the year, China began to decline in Q2 in line with decreasing government investment in infrastructure.
Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, said: “Thanks to our commitment to innovation and customer success, we have offset a slowdown in China with a solid increase in demand across our other key regions of Europe and North America. While maintaining a steady recovery from the challenges of last year remains our top priority, we have also continued our journey of innovation with a number of exciting launches this quarter, including our entry into the 50 ton excavator segment and the launch of our first dedicated Fuel Cell Test Lab.”

  The target of net-zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 is a united commitment for Volvo Group across all business areas, and is set for 10 years earlier than the SBTi commitment. This is because Volvo products have an average lifetime of 10 years in the customer use-phase, so for the entire rolling fleet to have net-zero emissions by 2050, it is necessary that all products delivered after 2040 have net-zero emissions.
  Volvo CE has also set its own high interim goals to be met by 2030, including cutting emissions in half in its own operations, facilities and manufacturing processes, and achieving 30% in absolute reductions in the use of its products, whose indirect emissions account for the highest proportion of the company’s carbon emissions. For the construction equipment industry, the majority of emissions are those referred to as indirect emissions, in other words the emissions created when the machines are being used as soon as they leave the factories. 
  Volvo CE President Melker Jernberg says: “Climate change is real and one of the greatest challenges of our time. As a world leading manufacturer, we not only have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, we also have the clear vision, determination and talents to drive this transformation that is so urgently needed now. The choices we make today, will form the world tomorrow – and we choose to act.” 
    STRONGER TOGETHER

Volvo CE is already committed to decarbonization through its industry-leading technology development and engagement in climate change initiatives, such as the Construction Climate Challenge (CCC) and the WWF Climate Savers Program. With SBTi, it has another tool to make sure the reductions are aligned with the latest climate science to reach the Paris Agreement. 
The company is taking a holistic approach to tackling climate change. It will follow its tried-and-tested innovation pathway of embracing the three streams of electromobility: battery-electric machines, hydrogen fuel-cell powered equipment and improved internal combustion engine solutions. It will also continue its work with industry-leading partnerships to accelerate development of new technologies, working together with customers to bring sustainable solutions to market and collaborating with dealers and suppliers to explore new ways of working.
“New exciting technology is definitely one of the key ways to reduce carbon impact,” says Niklas Nillroth, Head of Sustainability and Public Affairs at Volvo CE. “However, another significant driver in achieving these targets will be a new level of collaboration, internally as well as externally though partnerships. Only with joint efforts, where each and every one of us takes responsibility for our part with a holistic mindset, will we be able to collectively reach these important goals. Together we help build the world we want to live in.”
SBTi is a collaboration between CDP, United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It helps companies establish science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transform business operations to fit the future low-carbon economy. "

Recently ranked at 85% by the Global Destination Sustainability Index, Zurich has an impressive record when it comes to sustainability, with 82% of its electricity coming from renewable energies and 43% of its waste recycled. 

In a country that already has strict air pollution directives in place requiring particulate filters for diesel engines and has set out a roadmap for electromobility, a shift towards electric machines then seems the most logical next step.

The Volvo L25 Electric compact wheel loader is demonstrating its value at Eberhard, a company which is proud to be a pioneer in building and environmental services, and offers civil engineering, deconstruction, recycling and the remediation of contaminated sites. From recycling concrete rubble in the 1980s to building the first soil washing plant for 
contaminated soil in the 1990s - which can still boast to be the largest in Switzerland – protecting the environment has always been important to Eberhard. 

Today, the company is building a plant for processing mixed demolition material and has developed zirkulit®, the most environmentally friendly concrete in the world. Silvan Eberhard, Head of Logistics, at Eberhard, said: “We are investing a lot to make our construction sites as environmentally friendly as possible. We’re supporters of the circular economy and sustainability is part of our culture.”
The L25 Electric in operation clearing roads at an Eberhard site
  “The L25 Electric is being used at one of our landfill sites as well as for road clearing, small-scale material handling and as a forklift. With the batteries acting as a counterweight, it can really lift a lot for a compact machine. It’s biggest advantage, though, is that it’s low emission, silent and has minimal vibration. Our operators enjoy working with it. In future, we plan to use the L25 Electric on our construction sites in downtown Zurich, and other cities where requests for low emissions and silence is high.” 

A second Volvo CE electric machine, the ECR25 Electric is in action at B. MEIER ABBRUCH + TIEFBAU AG, the demolition and civil engineering firm. The compact excavator, which has been branded especially in the company’s signature red color, is being used to prepare sites for construction.
The ECR25 Electric – the first compact electric excavator from Volvo CE in Switzerland
  Bruno Meier, CEO and Owner at B. MEIER ABBRUCH + TIEFBAU AG, explains: “The responsibility for looking after our environment falls on everyone. As our organization has grown, we wanted to look at alternative machines that don’t rely on diesel or petrol. The ECR25 Electric is our first foray into the world of electric machines.

“We are using the excavator in built-up areas and complex spaces, such as near hospitals and schools, where its emission-free and silent operation really comes into its own.”

While electric machines require less servicing than their traditional counterparts, they do still need servicing, which is where the specialist expertise of dealership Robert Aebi AG comes in.
The ECR25 Electric gets a makeover from B. Meier AG
The company is providing full servicing and specialists after-sales support for customers of these electric machines.As more countries and organizations look to tackle their own carbon footprints, the market for electric machines is set to grow. And with the right government incentives and regulations demanding low-emission, low-noise machines, along with the specialist support provided by local firms, the future for electric looks bright.

The dedicated lab, located at the Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) Technical Center in Eskilstuna, Sweden, represents a big step forward in the company’s commitment to hydrogen. The lab is also the first facility in Volvo Group to be testing complete fuel cell units, and will as such be a strong contributor to the company’s dedication to fuel cell technology.
Toni Hagelberg, Head of Sustainable Power at Volvo CE, says: “Fuel cell technology is a key enabler of sustainable solutions for heavier construction machines, and this investment provides us with another vital tool in our work to reach Science-Based Targets. The lab will also serve Volvo Group globally, as it’s the first to offer this kind of advanced testing. It’s a really exciting step to accelerate the development of fuel cell solutions towards our united vision for a carbon neutral society.”
Fueling an emission-free world through hydrogen
Volvo CE sees hydrogen fuel cell technology as playing a key role within its overall electromobility ambitions, together with battery electric solutions, as demonstrated by the electric compact machines, and more sustainable internal combustion engine offerings – with all three streams working in alignment on the journey towards a carbon neutral society. While battery electric solutions are ideal for urban construction and other use cases, the size of the batteries is simply too impractical for larger machines and heavy construction equipment, which is where hydrogen comes in as a promising alternative.
“Hydrogen can be produced in many different ways and it’s important to have a life-cycle approach across the entire value chain”, says Hagelberg. “Not only will the research and development carried out at the test lab be dedicated to producing fossil-free construction solutions, we will also look at how the hydrogen itself has been produced, and strive for so called “green” hydrogen produced from renewable energy.”
Hydrogen fuel cell development forms a key part of Volvo Group’s overall electromobility ambition to be carbon neutral by 2040.
  How it works
Simply put, fuel cells work by combining hydrogen with oxygen, with the resulting chemical reaction producing electricity. The process is completely emission-free, with the only by-product being water vapor. In principle, a fuel cell works much like a battery, except that it generates its own electricity from the hydrogen on-board rather than being charged from an external source. This means it can deliver longer driving ranges, and therefore is more feasible for long-haul transportation and heavier equipment.
An added benefit of hydrogen fuel cell solutions, is that they will also be free from the traditional machinery noise pollution. Without a combustion engine, hydrogen powered machines will be comparable to the low noise levels of the electric compact machines.
The Fuel Cell Test Lab is a demonstration of the same dedication to hydrogen fuel cell technology, as the recent launch of cell centric, a joint venture by Volvo Group and Daimler Truck to accelerate the development, production and commercialization of fuel cell solutions within long-haul trucking and beyond. Both form a key part of the Group’s overall ambition to be 100% fossil free by 2040."

For Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE), it’s an opportunity not only for digital transformation, but to build a future that we all want to live and work in.","The Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0 – which was first identified by Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum in his book of the same name - is revolutionizing the way companies manufacture, improve and distribute their products. Volvo CE is embracing the change and putting the power for innovation directly in the hands of its employees with a vision of the future it’s calling Factory 4 Tomorrow (F4T).
Explaining the company’s approach, Lina Stålberg, Manufacturing Technology Development and Governance at Volvo CE, says: “For us, Factory 4 Tomorrow is about far more than just introducing new technologies, there’s a far higher purpose behind it. It’s about building a world we want to live in and workplaces we want to work in.”
Across 14 sites around the world, smart factory teams have been set up, tasked with looking for ways to innovate and impact the business. Working closely with others at the site, these teams are actively seeking ways to solve everyday business problems and challenges with the help of exciting new technologies, such as IoT, AI and machine learning. They will be experimenting and testing to generate new ideas and ways of working. It will be a complete overhaul of every production detail and the innovations that are explored could very well become a reality on the factory floor in the coming years. Automation in the factories and offices, for example, will reduce the need for employees to engage in repetitive tasks, creating a safer and more ergonomic work environment.
Lina adds: “To be successful, it’s critical to create the right culture for change. We want our people to be excited by the possibilities new technologies can deliver and the solutions they can provide to real problems they might face in their day-to-day jobs and lives. That’s why our approach is collaborative and very much bottom-up. We’re empowering our employees to help enact change.”
Factory 4 Tomorrow will explore new technologies and ways of working to make manufacturing more sustainable.
Brunno Muller, Head of Advanced Manufacturing Engineering and Research at Volvo CE, comments: “Our role is very much to facilitate good dialogue and collaboration and provide coaching and mentoring to help guide the site teams on their journeys. We hold the big picture, but it is up to the individual sites to identify areas for change. It’s very inspiring to see how engagement in Factory 4 Tomorrow is growing across the entire organization, from employees all the way up to leaders. And with it, we are all developing new skills and competencies.”
As well as creating an attractive workplace, Factory 4 Tomorrow will transform manufacturing processes at Volvo CE, delivering significant benefits for customers, many of whom are demanding more customization and more individualized products. Thanks to globalization and new technologies, flexibility and speed of change are becoming ever more important. A digital transformation will accelerate Volvo CE’s lean journey towards operational excellence. Optimized manufacturing will also bring sustainability benefits, helping to reduce Volvo CE’s industrial footprint.
Brunno continues: “At Volvo CE, our mindset is very much based on collaboration, both internally between teams and across sites, as well as externally with customers, suppliers and partners. We cannot build the future we want by ourselves. We need to step away from silo thinking and consider how we do this end-to-end, joining forces with partners and sharing experiences.”
Transformation is happening everywhere, and with Factory 4 Tomorrow, Volvo CE is once again demonstrating its commitment to building a future that is cleaner, safer and more connected."
By Press Information,4/22/2021,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2021/good-performance-sees-q1-sales-increase/,GOOD PERFORMANCE SEES Q1 SALES INCREASE 23%,"Thanks to a strong recovery in the second half of last year driven by high activity level in the infrastructure segment and improved construction activity, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has seen overall demand in Q1, 2021 increase sharply from the same period last year, with order intake also rising by 73%.","Demand in China, the world’s largest construction equipment market, was strong due to governmental infrastructure investments. Together with an increase in sales across all global markets and segments, China’s investment helped Volvo CE reverse the negative impact shaped by Covid-19 last year for the first quarter 2021 financial results. Deliveries also increased by 53% in Q1, driven by higher sales in all regions with the largest increase again in China.
During the first three months of 2021 Volvo CE saw net sales increase by 23% to SEK 24,742 M (SEK 20,148 M in Q1 2020) – slightly higher than the same period in 2019 before the pandemic hit. At SEK 3,822 M operating income also rose, up from SEK 2,678 M in the same period of 2020. Earnings were positively impacted by higher machine volumes and capacity utilization in the industrial system, cost reductions and increased service earnings, which were partly offset by negative mix effects. This was reflected in the operating margin, which at 15.4% was up from 13.3% in the same period the year before.
As well as strong infrastructure investment, low inventory levels at dealers and their need to restock also contributed to the increase in order intake to 73% for Q1, 2021. In comparison to the expected slowdown and uncertainty created by the outbreak of Covid-19 of last year, deliveries across all regions increased. Demand for large and medium sized machines were stronger than those for compact machines.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Despite all markets showing increased overall demand, Europe had a slow start to the year impacted by Covid-19 restrictions in key markets such as France and Germany, but has since gained momentum. While its net order intake has increased by 87%, thanks to stronger demand in the later half of the quarter, Europe’s total market development has declined by 9%. In China, Volvo CE’s market development is up 142% in the first two months, when compared to the very low volumes caused by Covid-19 in Q1, 2020. Asia (not including China) also enjoyed a positive start to the year with a 16% improvement, particularly prominent in key markets including India, Korea and South East Asia. South America is also strong, up 41% from last year, reflecting increased demand for commodities. While in North America, expectations for further government infrastructure investments are creating a positive sentiment among customers, leading to a 7% increase from Q1, 2020.
Volvo CE President Melker Jernberg says: “It is heartening to see demand increasing in the first quarter of this year, with sales up across all regions and markets. We can take confidence that we have weathered a tough period for our customers, our employees and the wider industry and are beginning to now see higher activity. In many countries, we have seen increased investment in an aging infrastructure, something which we expect to continue for the future. Together with a high level of construction activity in several other sectors, this is driving demand for both new machines and services, reflected in both deliveries and order intake rising sharply for the first quarter.”

The environmentally-conscious company is already enjoying the benefits of having this emission-free machine on site.","Following the unveiling of the Volvo EC55 Electric excavator in China at the China International Import Expo 2020, the first customer pilot machine has now been delivered to aluminum company Xinyuan for customer testing.
  Xinyuan is using the 5.5-ton electric excavator from Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) for ground grading and earthwork loading at its new plant in Liaocheng, Shandong Province. The customer trial will last 500 hours and focus mainly on testing noise and emissions. The project team will work closely with the customer to ensure improvements based on feedback received.
  “China is the perfect place to test our new machines and gain valuable customer feedback. That is why it’s exciting for us to see this machine already operating at Xinyuan’s site, and how it makes their employees’ daily work easier and more comfortable,” says Mats Sköldberg, Head of Technology at Volvo CE China.
  Xinyuan is already enjoying the benefits of having this machine at its new plant. “We are glad to have this machine working at our site. As an environmentally-conscious company, we strive to achieve zero emissions. We are also happy about the low noise from the machine, which is what we needed,” says Mr. Yang, Director for Equipment Management at Xinyuan.
  The team behind the development of the EC55 Electric excavator at the Volvo Technology Center in Jinan China 
  The Volvo EC55 Electric customer pilot excavator offers quiet and emission-free operation, supporting China’s pursuit of green energy and green vehicles. It is based on its diesel-powered counterpart, the EC55D, and has been designed to deliver even better performance and controllability with the added benefits of quiet operation and zero emissions. Since the energy running costs are 50% lower and the maintenance requirements simpler, the EC55 Electric should also achieve higher uptime and a lower total cost of ownership.
  “We have used local solutions to put together a competitive machine that we believe reaches a high maturity level already. By combining the technology of electrical propulsion with connectivity, we offer an attractive overall package of low noise, zero emissions, high efficiency, high uptime, reduced operating cost and reduced total cost of ownership. We have full confidence in the success of this customer pilot,” Sköldberg concludes.
  This excavator is not commercially available yet but during this research phase Volvo CE aims to mature it quickly so that it can be commercialized as soon as possible."
By Press Information,4/6/2021,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2021/innovation-has-no-gender-volvo-ce-inspiring-tomorrows-female-engineers/,INNOVATION HAS NO GENDER: VOLVO CE INSPIRING TOMORROW’S FEMALE ENGINEERS,"Following the discouraging news that it is around the age of 10 at which girls stop considering engineering as a potential career path, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) saw it as an opportunity to redress the balance.","Through a series of innovation workshops called Vera – in honor of Sweden’s first female engineer Vera Sandberg – Volvo CE together with strategic partner Mälardalen University (MDH) set about reversing this trend by inspiring young girls to recognize their abilities in science and technology. In these workshops, girls aged 10 and over are given a series of challenges, all of which are set against real-life scenarios, and provided with a number of tools and materials to work together to find technological solutions.
  Not only have the girls shown a stronger interest in these subjects as a result, but evidence shows that the long-term benefit of a better gender balance in engineering will result in more inclusive and innovative solutions for society’s complex problems. 
  The influence behind the initiative comes from the findings of researcher Ulrika Sultan from Linköping University, whose work is focused on understanding why girls lose interest in technology education as they get older. In many Western countries there is a cultural tipping point at around the age of 10. Ulrika, who used to be a teacher herself, says: “In our study, we stress that at nine years’ old, girls can and do strive to be the best, but suddenly, just one school year later, they move from being excited to showcase their intellect and problem-solving skills to shying away from revealing their best.”
  But by reaching out to these girls and giving them the support and mentoring needed to boost their perception of these subjects, organizers of the Vera innovation workshops believe it is possible to reverse this trend.
  Anna Sannö (left) and Ulrika Sultan at one of the workshops
Anna Sannö, Research Strategy Manager, at Volvo CE, who is co-managing the initiative along with San Giliyana and Natalie Agerskans from Mälardalen University, says: “At Volvo CE we were really encouraged by this idea that we could reach out to girls at a younger age and show them the potential for a career in engineering. We simply do not get enough female candidates applying for these sorts of technology roles within the company. 
  “It is not just a problem for us, it is a societal problem for us all because if we exclude 50% of the population of technology users from being technology creators, we will see a society only addressed for men by men. In this program it has been incredibly rewarding to work like this with our potential future colleagues.”
  Originally started in 2019 as a way to celebrate the life of engineer Vera Sandberg, the workshops were held across 13 universities in Sweden and were primarily focused on older children, as well as raising awareness among decision-makers. MDH as a university decided to build on Ulrika’s discovery of the importance of reaching girls at a much younger age and opened up the workshops to 10-year-olds. Now the events will be moving online – to keep children safe during the pandemic – until they can meet again in person.
  Students are tasked with solving real-life challenges using technology and teamwork
  At the workshops, students will spend one hour each week over four weeks to solve problems such as how to make traffic safer, how to use technology to help us throw away less food and how to make recycling more fun. The challenges are designed to be rooted in reality with a focus on sustainability. 
“We’ve discovered that the more open ended the challenge and the more recognizable it is to the world around them, the more engaged these girls become,” says Anna. “In the first 15 minutes they are usually quite hesitant, but by the end they are more confident in their opinion and are even happy to present their findings in front of everyone.”
  Importantly, the workshops and materials are presented in exactly the same as what would be presented to boys, letting the girls’ experience the challenges as authentically as possible. In just the same way as organizers recognize that innovation has no gender, there is also no restriction on the gender of the mentors. The sessions are run equally by women and men in order to demonstrate that reversing these gender stereotypes is the responsibility of everyone.
  Every workshop concludes with presentations from Volvo CE engineers and university students and professors. While it is a learning opportunity for the girls, it is also a chance to help school teachers rethink the way they present engineering as a career option for girls. 
  The initiative has proved a great way to connect real life to the work carried out every day at Volvo CE. By taking part in the workshops, sharp-thinking students can better picture themselves succeeding in a career in science and engineering and in doing so play an important role in one day effecting positive societal change."

","The shift will involve:
  Together with dealer partners, an increased focus on local market Volvo branded events to build stronger and more sustainable customer relationships 
A commercial marketing approach aimed at seamless integration of developing digital and traditional marketing channels
Increased investment in digital channels and campaigns to reflect changing customer touchpoints and behaviors 
  As a result, Volvo CE has decided not to attend Bauma Munich 2022.
  Seamless integration of developing digital and traditional marketing channels
  Volvo CE will be refocusing on its own purpose-built audience outreach combining physical, digital and hybrid events. The move will allow for a more flexible, tailor-made offer, however and wherever the customer wants to interact with Volvo products and services. 
  The new approach has been influenced by changes in customer behavior and needs which have accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic. The new approach also reflects increasing demands being made to do business in a more sustainable manner and to reduce the company’s environmental footprint.
  Physical interaction remains a key component of customer engagement
  Carl Slotte, Head of Region Europe at Volvo CE, says: “Whilst physical interaction remains very important, we are beginning to see significant changes in the way our customers want to engage with us both digitally and face-to-face. This is driven both by technological possibilities of doing business more efficiently and the increasing need to do business more sustainably.”
  Future tradeshow participation
  “Despite our withdrawal from next year´s event, we have not ruled out future participation at Bauma or other tradeshows,” he adds. “We will continue to review the way our customers want to interact with us and base our strategy on their needs and demands.”"
By Press Information,3/22/2021,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2021/volvo-ce-trains-technicians-in-transition-to-electric-machines/,VOLVO CE TRAINS TECHNICIANS IN TRANSITION TO ELECTRIC MACHINES,"The shift to electrification requires more than switching to zero exhaust machines – the whole supply chain needs to be empowered to optimize these gamechanging construction solutions. To ease the transition, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is going above and beyond in supporting equipment rental company Loxam to make the most of their new electric acquisitions.","Following the arrival of 18 Volvo ECR25 Electric machines in the Loxam rental branches located across France, Volvo CE is carrying out thorough training sessions to ensure these electric compact excavators are offering the best possible value to customers. Support covers everything from the technical – maintenance, charging systems and mechanics – through to the commercial knowledge required to guide employees, technicians and customers on the market value, site productivity and environmental benefits of going electric.
  Sébastien Perusse, Sales Manager for Compact Machines, at Volvo CE, says: “This is an entirely different approach to how we would normally engage with dealerships during the sale of more conventional construction machines. It’s a great opportunity to not only create a new market that is fully equipped and energized to move to electric machines, but also to engage directly with customers and respond to their own unique requirements.”
  An electric solution for low emission zones
  Loxam, the number one rental company in France and in Europe has been a partner of Volvo CE for more than 25 years. Loxam recently launched its LoxGreen range of equipment in a bid to rent out more environmentally friendly electric, hybrid and natural gas-powered machines – perfectly suited to the requirements of neighboring low emission zones.

Eighteen models of the ECR25 Electric have been sold as part of Loxam’s LoxGreen rental range.
Volvo CE was chosen as an ideal partner to assist in this transition thanks to its reputation for developing reliable electric transport solutions and its focus on safety, strong communication and highly skilled technical support. In addition, the 2.5-ton Volvo excavator is the most popular model in Loxam’s fleet. “We are convinced that the new ECR25 Electric will encounter huge enthusiasm from users compared to other electric models,” says Perusse. 
Not only does it offer zero CO2 emissions, but operators report a far more enjoyable work environment with near silence, low vibration and more comfortable controls. The machine, which was developed and built at Volvo CE’s Belley factory in France, has the same performance as its diesel counterpart, and its battery pack offers a full day’s working time, depending on application.
  The training sessions are a new type of support to help customers and technicians navigate the electric shift.

The goal of these training sessions is to provide Loxam with the new skills required to ensure maximum uptime for these electric models. This includes advice on diagnostics, maintenance and the use and handling of charging systems and electric components, as well as a reminder on the mechanics themselves such as hydraulic pumps, filters and hoses.

They also cover basics on safety and the needs of specific electricity agreements. Another key component of these sessions is advice on how to present an electric excavator to a customer who may be more used to diesel variants and on why they should consider switching to electric. 
Thierry Lahuppe, Loxam Equipment Director, says: “As a leader, we are dedicated to anticipating and pushing forward new solutions to help our customers lower their carbon footprint. We were very interested in sharing our insights during the development process of this new equipment. Today, we are more convinced than ever that we must work together to smartly combat climate change.”
  This extra support was provided as part of the sale of these machines, financed by Volvo Financial Services, and is an example of how new business models are being successfully introduced in order to smoothly integrate electric models into a changing market."

Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has secured its position as one of the most beloved branded toys, thanks to a gamechanging partnership with toymaker Dickie Toys.","Volvo CE released to the market its biggest ever range of toy excavators, loaders, haulers and trucks – and even a fictional wrecking ball – in collaboration with German toymaker Dickie Toys last year. The partnership, which ensured Volvo’s presence in almost every major toy store, has had a flying start, despite the obvious challenges for the retail industry posed by Covid-19, with well over a million products sold in the last 12 months.
  The collaboration represents a unique point in Volvo CE’s licensing journey, following on the heels of successful partnerships with toymakers LEGO® Technic and Bruder, among others, and marking the company’s first venture into fully-immersive play sets for all the ages. It is also the most comprehensive collaboration across the Group, with machines from not only Volvo CE, but also Volvo Trucks and Mack Trucks.
  The toy range marks a successful collaboration between Volvo CE, Volvo Trucks, Mack Trucks and of course Dickie Toys (picture taken at the beginning of the collaboration)
Tim Birks, Merchandise and Licensing Manager, at Volvo CE, says: “Dickie Toys was a natural choice. We share the same core values, we are aligned in our desire for good quality products and we have always been impressed with the ‘feel-good factor’ of their toys. And it’s been comforting to know that these toys have played an important role in keeping children around the world entertained and engaged during some of the hardest months of the pandemic.”
  Family-owned Dickie Toys is a German-based manufacturer and part of the larger Simba Dickie Group, which is one of the top five toy manufacturers in Europe.
  A close relationship between teams across the two brands has ensured a deep consideration for the Volvo identity. By creating ‘real-life’ play sets, as well as individual toys, the partnership aims to inspire imaginative play. 
  “We are delighted about our fruitful and trustful cooperation with Volvo. Children are fascinated by huge construction vehicles, such as from Volvo with its technical expertise. Dickie Toys accompanies children through all stages of their development, therefore Volvo is predestined for our toys range,” says Oliver Naumann, Managing Director of Dickie Toys. “The products are very well received by the consumers and are very successful at the point of sale, as well as on and offline.“

Its vital work in street cleaning and waste disposal ensure that not only is this cathedral city kept clean and safe, but that the surrounding Rhine area and its network of highways are kept open and safe for travellers all over the region. Around 700 employees are on hand to keep some 2,000 km of main road, 600 km of access road and 500 km of residential street free from snow and ice.
ZERO DEGREES, ZERO EMISSIONS
For such a substantial task during the most challenging months of the year, AWB needed a partner that could play a vital role in its operations – one that could not only work with power and performance no matter the conditions, but also one that would limit its environmental impact with zero emissions. Which is why AWB chose the L25 Electric, through Volvo partner and dealership Swecon Baumaschinenen GmbH, to help in keeping its winter service provision moving from its new depot in the heart of the city. As well as being reliable, efficient and good value for money, the electric wheel loader was picked for the task because it produces zero exhaust fumes, low noise and low vibrations, making it an ideal solution for work inside a depot, without the need for a ventilation system.
The L25 Electric is working inside AWB’s depot handling the transportation of grit for the city’s streets
Sustainability has been a core objective at AWB for some time and the company is recognized as a pioneer of environmentally responsible initiatives within its industry. In addition, the company regards itself as a partner to the City of Cologne and is committed to continuously improving the quality of life for its citzens. As such, care is always taken to only employ vehicles and machines that are low emission.
“The wheel loader is an important milestone in our journey to introduce more electric mobility at AWB Cologne and is certainly fulfilling our expectations,” says Dr. Bert Schröer, Head of Mobility and Sustainability at AWB Cologne. “We are managing well with the electric power – even in the cold. Capacity, handling and shovel size – everything fits. So far, there have been no aspects that would make us question our decision. It was definitely the right choice.”
The machine's zero emissions, low noise and low vibrations are ideal for work inside the depot
A MACHINE WITH THE GRIT TO SUCCEED
As the first Volvo L25 Electric to be delivered to a job site in Germany, it has aleady proved a success since it started work back in December. And this new addition to the fleet has an important role to play. Its main task within the 1,700 sq m depot is to feed the screw conveyor which transports the material to the silos, which in turn fills AWB’s grit spreaders. “If the wheel loader doesn’t transport the grit to the silos, then there would be no grit on the streets of Cologne,” comments Schröer. “Maximum reliability and availability are therefore an absolute must.”
As the wheel loader is in continuous operation over three shifts throughout the winter service period, a four-year service agreement was signed. This includes the maintenance of the machine and its components. Fast charging infrastructure was developed at AWB’s depot to enable the L25 Electric to work independently. Swecon places great importance on training its employees, especially to aid in the transition towards electric construction machines, so that they can provide the best possible service to its customers. 
During the summer months, the L25 Electric will still be in demand when it is deployed as an 'allround loader', providing support for AWB's transport works across its 36,000 sq m territory, such as transporting arboreal waste to loading a variety of bulky goods."

This week, longstanding customers K Baugerød Anlegg and Veidekke took delivery of the first electric construction machines in the country – a Volvo ECR25 Electric compact excavator and a Volvo L25 Electric wheel loader.

K Baugerød Anlegg and Veidekke were among the first customers in the world to place an order for these groundbreaking new models during their global launch at the Bauma exhibition in Munich, Germany, in 2019. In signing the contracts, Volvo CE, K Baugerød Anlegg and Veidekke committed to building a sustainable future together.

K Baugerød Anlegg plans to deploy the Volvo ECR25 Electric for its work with cable and pipeline construction in the city of Oslo City, while Veidekke will first use the Volvo L25 Electric in a job for the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. 
QUIET, EMISSION FREE OPERATION
“Our clients request more environmentally friendly solutions, and we want to be in the forefront. The new quiet and emission-free excavator will also make an immediate difference to the quality of life to the operator and other staff on site,” said Sara Iselin Nysveen Bakke, general manager at K Baugerød Anlegg.

Are Ellefsrud, machine manager at Veidekke added: “We are proud to be among the first construction companies in Norway to operate a Volvo electric machine and demonstrate to our customers and wider society that we take our role in caring for the environment and combatting climate change very seriously.”

The recipient of the new products – an electric Volvo FE truck, with electrically powered crane, and a Volvo ECR25 Electric compact excavator – was leading French contractor and long-term Volvo customer Eiffage. The machines support Eiffage’s low carbon strategy and are to work on the ambitious Grand Paris Express transport project in the French capital. This is a rapid transit initiative being built in the French capital that will add 200 kilometres (120 mi) of new track and 68 new stations, ultimately serving two million passengers a day. 

The handover of Volvo Trucks and Volvo Construction Equipment’s first all-electric products was marked with a small ceremony in Paris. It was attended by Benoit de Ruffray, Eiffage Group CEO, and representative of Volvo Truck and Volvo CE’s France-based teams. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, Volvo Group CEO Martin Lundstedt, Volvo CE President Melker Jernberg and Volvo Trucks President Roger Alm participated digitally. 

“By 2030, we want over a third of the machines the Volvo Group sells to be electric. We can’t do this alone, we want to do this together with our customers, partners like Eiffage and the wider society,” says Volvo Group CEO, Martin Lundstedt. “Today is an exciting landmark on this journey to shape the future of transport and infrastructure.”

“Today’s deliveries of this electric truck and construction machine is the start of a revolution in transport and infrastructure solutions,” agrees Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. “Make no mistake, electric machines are not going to remain a niche product area. Over the course of the next years and decades they will become the dominant source of low-or-no emission power. When coupled with clean energy, their potential to support climate change goals, improve air quality and help build the world we all want to live in cannot be underestimated. I’m very pleased that we are starting this journey with friends such as Eiffage.” 

“The support from forward-thinking customers like Eiffage is important for the future development of sustainable transport solutions. Keeping a close dialogue with customers means that we all learn faster and together can accelerate the necessary transition into a fossil-free future,"" says Roger Alm, President of Volvo Trucks.

This first delivery in France represents, for both Volvo CE and Volvo Trucks, an important and real step on the way to zero emissions. Thanks to their low noise and vibration levels, and their absence of exhaust gases, electric trucks and machines are well suited to meeting tough environmental regulation in urban areas, confined spaces, or specific works. They offer new opportunities for urbanization as well as road infrastructures.

The Volvo FE Electric 6X2 truck was built at the Volvo plant of Blainville sur Orne in France. It will be used to deliver and collect tools and spare parts for demolition works of Part 1 – line 16 and Part T2B of line 15 of the Grand Paris Express project. It will do around 150 km per day – all of them with zero exhaust emissions.

The Volvo ECR25 Electric compact excavator, will be used by Eiffage in support of demolition and dismantling activities, again with zero CO2 emissions and far lower noise and vibration levels than traditional diesel engine machines. The 2.5-ton machine has the same performance as its diesel counterpart, and its battery pack offers four hours work time, depending on application. The Volvo ECR25 Electric was developed and built at Volvo CE’s Belley factory in France."

If widely adopted, it could help the industry meet its sustainability ambitions while at the same time improving machine performance.","Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is committed to a sustainable future – achieved through internal developments and external partnerships. As part of this strategy Volvo CE, in cooperation with Finland’s Norrhydro, is developing a new technology that is set to revolutionize machine hydraulic performance. When commercialized, the potential customer and climate benefits are expected to be radical, with machine fuel efficiency significantly increased and CO2 emissions being cut. 

While the full details of the revolutionary technology are closely guarded, the Norrhydro patented system, NorrDigiTM, uses a multi-chamber digital hydraulic actuator that improves system efficiency that much of a machine’s hydraulic system can be discarded or downsized. It removes the need for a main control valve – the heart of a traditional hydraulic system – along with excessive pump capacity, piping and hoses. It uses less energy and offers the prospect for downsizing the engine capacity. 
‘IT REMOVES THE NEED FOR A MAIN CONTROL VALVE – THE HEART OF A TRADITIONAL HYDRAULIC SYSTEM.’
 
The ongoing validations of the solution have demonstrated both efficiency improvement and an increased machine productivity. With carbon dioxide emissions reduced, it is making a radical cut in the machine’s carbon footprint. Volvo CE and Norrhydro have signed a multi-year agreement where Volvo CE will continue to develop the technology in partnership with Norrhydro, and subsequently aim for first mover advantage. Volvo CE has exclusive rights to its use in its products during the development process.
SMART CYLINDERS 
Unlike traditional cylinders with two chambers – one pushing, one pulling – the digital hydraulic actuator uses four chambers that can be connected in up to 16 different permutations, depending on the load required by the desired operation. “It’s a bit like a 16-speed linear transmission,” says Peter Stambro, Vice President Business Development at Norrhydro. “Multi-chamber cylinders have been around for a while, but what makes our ones exceptional is the way they have been combined with advanced electronic control systems, whose complex algorithms and computational speed allow for instant response, but using only a fraction of the energy for the same machine maneuver or action compared to a traditional system.” 

“This is a prime example of how partnerships with outside experts can accelerate our own sustainability journey through technical innovation,” says Thomas Bitter, Head of Technology at Volvo CE. “In research so far, the system shows greatest benefits in larger machines – in the case of excavators, those 30 tons and above. However, in the future, the technology could also be used in electric machines, where its much greater hydraulic system efficiency would effectively extend the battery life and operating window,” concludes Bitter. 
‘IN ELECTRIC MACHINES….IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY EXTEND THE BATTERY RUN-TIME AND OPERATING WINDOW.’
ENTERING FIELD TEST PHASE
With a Volvo EC300E 30 ton excavator as a test bed, the revolutionary technology has passed its initial proof-of-concept phase and durability tests, and is now moving to a field test period, where prototypes are used in real world applications by selected customer partners. It is forecast that the revolutionary system will be offered on the company’s excavators by 2024 at the latest. 

“The ability to develop this radical technology in partnership with a leading player in the construction equipment industry offers many advantages, including accelerating the time to market for commercialized products,” say Yrjö Trög, CEO of Norrhydro. “We will invest in a new multi-million euro world-class manufacturing facility in support of the launch, and I look forward to the market introduction of the NorrDigiTM system together with Volvo CE.,”"

Some of these technologies are already available to customers today, while others are being implemented or part of the company’s innovation strategy.
CONNECTIVITY AND REMOTE MONITORING
Among the exciting innovations already available to customers is Volvo ActiveCare, one of the highlights of the Volvo Services showcase at the exhibition. Volvo ActiveCare is a machine monitoring and proactive maintenance service, using data from connected machines to take preventative action and avoid unplanned downtime. When customers subscribe to the service, data from the Volvo CareTrack telematics system on their machines is fed in real time to the Volvo Uptime Center. Here, case handlers monitor the machines’ performance and if an error code or alarm occurs that might lead to a breakdown, they call the closest dealer to the machine, suggesting an action for the dealer to relay to the customer. Customers can rest assured that potential issues will be noticed, and preventative action taken to ensure maximum uptime for their machines. 
SILENT AND SUSTAINABLE POWER FOR CHINA’S URBAN AREAS
Exemplifying its innovations for the near future, Volvo CE has on display two new electric customer pilot excavators at bauma CHINA – the 5.5-t EC55 Electric and the 22-t EC230 Electric – which will shortly go for testing by real customers in China. These electric excavators are powered by lithium ion batteries and can work a full day with a high-power lunch-hour charge. This is the first time Volvo CE has developed electric customer pilot machines for China. These excavators are not commercially available yet but during this research phase Volvo CE aims to mature them quickly so that they can be commercialized as soon as possible.

The EC55 Electric has been developed in China with locally sourced components for the needs of Chinese customers, using a common electromobility and charging platform. The EC230 Electric, meanwhile, has been designed at Volvo facilities in Changwon, South Korea to suit a broader Asian customer base. 

Although the two excavators differ in size, they will both deliver the same performance as their diesel-powered counterparts, if not better, with the added benefits of zero emissions, low noise, and low total cost of ownership. The energy running costs for the EC55 Electric are expected to be 50% lower than for its conventional diesel-powered counterpart the EC55D, while the EC230 Electric is expected to achieve a 60-70% reduction compared to the diesel-powered EC220E.

“China is the largest electromobility market globally and a leading producer of electromobility components, which provides the demand and means to manufacture a machine locally. In addition, China has an industrial strategy to decrease dependence on diesel and so the electromobility market is expected to move quicker. These factors make China the perfect place to test our new machines and gain valuable customer feedback,” says Mats Sköldberg, Head of Technology at Volvo CE China. 
INNOVATION FOR A SAFER FUTURE
EX03 concept wheeled excavator

Volvo CE is also presenting the 14-t EX03 electric wheeled excavator prototype, which is earlier on its development phase than the EC55 Electric and EC230 Electric customer pilots. The EX03 offers the same low noise, zero emissions, energy efficiency and simple maintenance, but includes several groundbreaking safety features. 

When driving on public highways, a real-time video stream from the front of the excavator will allow vehicles behind to clearly see ahead. When working, a text-based safety screen will alert job site staff to left/right movement and reversing. A communication live stream will also enable the operator to make eye contact with pedestrians and other works to help minimize misunderstandings and increase safety. While still in the concept stage, Volvo CE is exploring the possibility of eventually trialing a similar version of the EX03 in customer pilots.
THE FUTURE OF QUARRYING
Finally, Volvo CE is displaying a miniature Volvo Electric Site model. Volvo Electric Site is the company’s vision for the future of quarrying, which is designed to achieve zero emissions, zero accidents, zero unplanned stops and ten times greater efficiency. Although the Volvo Electric Site is not a commercial offer, it could serve as a model for rethinking production operations to run on green, sustainable power, while increasing safety and efficiency. Indeed, its application is not limited to quarries. 
Volvo Electric Site miniature model
The Volvo Electric Site system consists of four HX02 autonomous, battery-electric load carriers, one LX01 electric-hybrid wheel loader prototype, and one EX01 70-ton dual-powered, cable-connected excavator prototype.

Even the co-developed LEGO® Technic™ 6X6 articulated hauler Volvo A60H model is an engineering marvel – featuring app-controlled operation and fully automatic transmission.,"Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) was the first to popularize the articulated hauler concept in 1966 with the birth of the 10-ton payload DR631 – fondly known as ‘Gravel Charlie’. Some 54 years later the company is still transporting earth, gravel and a host of other materials over rough, muddy, slippery, steep or otherwise impassable terrain. Volvo CE remains the market leader and continues to innovate with its H-Series range – which now includes its biggest ever production articulated hauler – the 60-ton capacity A60H. 
JUST LIKE THE REAL THING
In a classic case of art reflecting reality, the LEGO® Technic™ 6X6 articulated hauler Volvo A60H model is also an impressive work of engineering. Inside its giant box are 2,193 pieces, including six large tyres and heavy-duty motors. And just like the real thing, it is a technological tour-de-force, featuring app-controlled operation and a fully automatic transmission – a first for the LEGO Technic brand.

The 55 tonne (60 ton) capacity A60H (the real one, that is) is designed for heavy hauling in severe off-road operations, including quarries, opencast mines and large earth-moving operations. And the engineers from both LEGO Technic and Volvo CE wanted the new model to reflect the quality, reliability and durability of the real thing. The model certainly is big – measuring 200mm (7in.) high, 200mm (7in.) wide and a vast 600mm (23in.) long. It is also packed with clever features, not least the complex internal gear system – which is fully automatic and motorized – just like the real thing.

The motors are well integrated and hidden under the hauler body and the cab – and the Bluetooth for the control hub is cleverly turned on by rotating the A60’s cab-top beacon. Much like all the electronic machine control systems on the real machine, the model’s Technic Control+ hub and the mobile phone application that goes with it control the model, allowing it to move forwards and backwards, steer side-to-side and elevate and lower the dumper’s hauler body. That’s not all, Control+ also extends the play value, by setting users a number of challenges that highlight features of the machine, such as moving uphill, going through the gears and tipping the load.

The model takes its influence from the ground-breaking features and latest innovations on the A60H. With matched drivetrain, automatic drive combinations, including 100% differential locks, all-terrain bogie, hydro-mechanical steering and active suspension, this machine is unbeatable. Fitted with an active hydraulic front suspension for higher hauling speeds in tough conditions, the A60H (the real one, again), optimizes operator comfort and stability during travel, allowing more material to be moved in a shorter time for unmatched productivity.
THE FUN GOES ON EVEN AFTER THE BUILD
“More than 50 years after we showed the world what an articulated hauler can do, we are still innovating and developing the concept.” says Volvo CE’s Mats Bredborg. “LEGO Technic and Volvo CE engineers have done an amazing job of replicating the A60H in miniature. It doesn’t just look like our A60H, it also follows its philosophy of innovative engineering and clever design. The Control+ mobile app and the automatic transmission are both incredible. Even the safety features – a key element of all Volvo machines – are all present and correct.” 

“This is one of the more complex LEGO Technic sets of recent years,” says Niels Henrik Horsted, Marketing Director, Product & Marketing Development at the LEGO Group. “The clever design is a great challenge during the build process, and the new LEGO Technic Control+ app allows the machine’s functions to be remotely controlled – and the fun continues long after the build is complete, with the app challenges.”"

The EC55 Electric customer pilot offers quiet and emission free operation, helping further China’s pursuit of green energy and green vehicles.","Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has unveiled its latest electromobility project, a 5.5-t electric excavator developed specifically for the needs of the Chinese market. This is the first time the company has introduced any sort of concept machine in China, let alone a mature pilot machine ready for customer testing.

“China is the largest e-mobility market globally and is moving quickly as the country strives for sustainable power and clean, emission-free vehicles,” says Mats Sköldberg, Head of Technology at Volvo CE China. “This, combined with the large local supply of e-mobility components, makes China the perfect place to innovate and test ground-breaking electric solutions.”

QUIET, SUSTAINABLE POWER
The EC55 Electric is based on its diesel-powered counterpart the EC55D and will deliver even better performance and controllability with the added benefits of quiet operation and zero emissions. Since the energy running costs are 50% lower and the maintenance requirements simpler, the EC55 Electric also achieves higher uptime and a lower total cost of ownership.

MADE IN CHINA FOR CHINA
The machine has been designed and built at the Volvo facilities in Jinan, China, using as many Chinese-sourced components as possible. Two lithium battery packs of 350 V – the same voltage found in Chinese homes and electric cars – and a standard Chinese charging solution allow operators to plug and play. 

Typical applications for this class of excavator include materials handling, site preparation in the building and construction industries, landscaping, and light utility work. The EC55 Electric will be able to work continuously on these tasks for four and a half hours without charging or nine hours with a lunch-hour fast charge.
FAST COMMERCIALIZATION
EC55 Electric customer pilot

Volvo CE has also included the latest telematics system in China, enabled by Volvo ActiveCare proactive monitoring, to fulfil Chinese electromobility data regulations and meet aftermarket service requirements. These in-built telematics will provide instant feedback, accelerating the company’s understanding of the excavator’s operation and performance for faster maturation and commercialization. 

“We have used local solutions to put together a competitive machine that we believe reaches a high maturity level already. By combining the technology of electrical propulsion with connectivity, we offer an attractive overall package of low noise, zero emissions, high efficiency, high uptime, reduce operating cost and reduced total cost of ownership. We have full confidence in the success of this customer pilot,” concludes Sköldberg."

Based on tried and tested technology and product design, the prototype is the next natural stage in Volvo CE’s electromobility journey, following on from previous iterations of the smaller fully electric EX02 concept electric excavator. While still in the concept stage with no current plans to bring it to market, the company is exploring the possibility of eventually trialing a similar version of the EX03 in customer pilots.

An exciting feature, on display exclusively for the China International Import Expo (CIIE) 2020 and bauma China 2020, is a video screen fixed to the rear of the EX03, which has three configurations:
A real-time video stream from the front of the machine allowing vehicles behind to clearly see clearly ahead when driving on public highways
A text-based safety screen alerting workers on site to left and right movement or reversing; and
A safety communication live stream enabling the operator to make eye contact with pedestrians and workers, minimizing misunderstandings and increasing safety.
The EX03, the new electric wheeled excavator concept.

Inwoo Kim, program manager for Advanced Engineering at Volvo CE, who oversaw the project, says: “This prototype is a significant step forward in the evolution of medium electric construction machines. As our first electric excavator concept in the mid-size range, we have been quick to build and expand on our existing electromobility technology. With the same power and force as a diesel machine of the same size, there has been no compromise on performance.”

Supported by technology from across the Volvo Group, the 14-tonne EX03 is equipped with a battery pack from Volvo Trucks and boasts the same performance level as a diesel machine of the same class. The electric wheeled excavator prototype aims to deliver zero emissions, higher efficiency, lower noise levels and reduced total cost of ownership compared to its conventional counterparts."

The concept combines intelligent machines, automation and electromobility to challenge traditional ways of working, and achieve zero emissions, zero unplanned stops, zero accidents and ten times greater efficiency. ","As part of the Volvo Group booth at China International Import Expo (CIIE), Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is displaying a mini Volvo Electric Site – a scale replica of the company’s groundbreaking concept for the quarrying industry. Volvo Electric Site project challenges traditional ways of working by electrifying each transport stage in a quarry, bringing together electric and autonomous prototype machines, and site management systems to form a complete site solution. The system is designed to achieve zero emissions, zero unplanned stops, zero accidents and ten times greater efficiency.
The mini site displayed at CIIE is a 5m x 5m construction site with six different scale models:
Four HX02 autonomous, battery-electric load carriers. This autonomous electric hauler was further developed by Volvo CE and has now been handed over for commercialization to Volvo Autonomous Solutions (VAS).
The new TA15 autonomous and electric haulers are part of the TARA autonomous transport solution from VAS. These machines use a lithium ion battery to power two electric motors driving the machine and a third driving the hydraulics. Each TA15 follows an adjustable, pre-programmed GPS path with a vision system which detects people and obstacles in the way.
    One LX01 wheel loader concept, which is a series hybrid with a driveline consisting of electric drive motors mounted at the wheels, electric-driven hydraulics, an energy storage system, a significantly smaller diesel engine, and new machine architecture. This combination enables a 50% improvement in fuel efficiency versus traditional wheel loaders, along with quieter operation and significantly lower emissions.
        The EX01 70-ton dual-powered, cable-connected excavator prototype. The base machine for the EX01 is a Volvo EC750 crawler excavator that has been upgraded to incorporate an electric motor in addition to the diesel engine. If the machine is plugged into the grid, zero emissions are emitted. If the cable is connected, the EX01 will automatically start in electric mode. If it’s not, it will start in diesel mode.
SAFER, GREENER AND MORE EFFICIENT
Although the Volvo Electric Site is not a commercial offer, it could serve as a model for rethinking production operations to run on green, sustainable power, while increasing safety and efficiency. Indeed, its application is not limited to quarries. 
“Volvo Electric Site is especially relevant for China as the country strives to reduce emissions and achieve energy independence. We hope our concept will serve as useful inspiration to challenge traditional ways of working for a greener, more energy efficient, and safer future,” says Mats Sköldberg, Head of Technology at the Volvo CE China. 
The concept was tested for 10 weeks at a real quarry outside Gothenburg in Sweden, where it achieved a 98% reduction in carbon emissions, 70% reduction in energy cost and 40% reduction in operator cost.
TOWARDS COMMERCIALIZATION
Different parts of the Volvo Group are now maturing the technologies to prepare them for commercialization. The electric excavator, which will be unveiled at bauma China, will shortly go for testing by real customers in China and South Korea to gather feedback. The TARA transport solution, including the TA15, will soon be commercialized by Volvo Autonomous Solutions.
“While the Volvo Electric Site presents a futuristic vision, the fact that we are testing some of the components with real customers in China to prepare them for commercialization means that these groundbreaking electric and autonomous technologies could only just be around the corner and help drive China’s industrial strategy towards green vehicles and sustainable power,” Sköldberg concludes."

While net sales in the third quarter decreased by 2% to SEK 17,619 M (17,921), when adjusted for currency movements they were up 6% in the period. Adjusted operating income was also slightly down, at SEK 1,963 M, compared to SEK 2,180 M in the corresponding period in 2019. This equated to an operating margin of 11.1% (12.2%). 

Net order intake in the third quarter increased by 40% compared with the same quarter in 2019. Deliveries increased by 20%, to 19,774 machines, in the third quarter, mainly driven by higher sales in China.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Most markets recovered well from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in the third quarter, with machine utilization at the end of the period at almost 2019 levels. That said, the ongoing uncertainty created by the pandemic weighed on the European market, which up to the end of August was down by 19%.

The North American market was also down by 19%, while South America was up 11%, albeit from very low levels in 2019. In Asia (excluding China), the total market was down 13%. The Chinese market recovered strongly from the impact of the pandemic, driven by government stimulus measures, prompting an increase in demand of 22% in the period.

“After the sharp Covid-19 triggered downturn of Q2 we saw construction activity gradually improve across most markets in the third quarter,” commented Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. “Demand was particularly strong in China, the world’s biggest market, and here we continued to grow our market share. With continuing uncertainty due to the ongoing spread of the pandemic, we will maintain a tight focus on cost control, and prioritize the health and safety of colleagues, customers and business partners.”

Now, in what has been a challenging year for people worldwide, the company is putting a renewed focus on this work with The Building Tomorrow Project.

From building schools for children in Beijing to building homes in hurricane-devastated Panama City, Florida — The Building Tomorrow Project seeks to create real change throughout the globe.

Putting real action behind the project’s purpose, one such example is the company’s commitment to tackle a key issue in the United States: disaster relief efforts.
Homes after hurricanes 
In February, Volvo CE turned its attention to hurricane-affected Panama City, Florida, where some families have been displaced for nearly two years since Hurricane Michael destroyed 10,000 homes in the county in October 2018. Twenty volunteers from Volvo CE and local dealer Cowin Equipment assisted in Habitat for Humanity rebuilding efforts there before the nonprofit organization’s planned builds were temporarily put on pause due to COVID-19 concerns.
A volunteer from Volvo CE (in blue) works alongside the future homeowner and her son in February 2020.
Throughout 2020 and 2021, Volvo CE, has committed to supporting Habitat for Humanity in North America: including in disaster relief areas such as Panama City and in communities served by local Volvo CE dealers.

While building efforts were temporarily paused during the health crisis, building is beginning to resume across the United States. While those efforts ramp up, the organization is encouraging virtual volunteerism to help raise funds in support of future build sites. In addition to the company’s commitment to support home builds as projects resume, Volvo CE North America recently donated $116,000 to Habitat for Humanity — a result of the company’s partnership with Discovery’s Gold Rush TV show and the sales proceeds of a custom Gold Rush excavator announced earlier this spring. The same sale also resulted in a $174,000 donation to Building Homes for Heroes — an organization that builds custom homes for U.S. veterans in need.

“Through our partnership with Volvo CE, Habitat is better poised to address the recovery work in areas affected by natural disasters and the affordable housing crisis that exists in communities around the world,” says Colleen Finn Ridenhour, Chief Development Officer for Habitat for Humanity International.
BUILDING TOMORROW ACROSS THE GLOBE
The work in Panama City is just one of many projects to be highlighted as part of The Building Tomorrow Project. In addition to helping families build adequate housing in North America, Volvo and its employees are helping to empower underprivileged youth in India by providing them with machine operating skills and contributing to the construction of hospitals and schools in Zambia, China and Latin America. While these are just a few examples, similar community projects are happening all over the world.
Operator training in India
But none of this is new. Volvo CE has always been driven by the idea that through the passion, hard work and collaboration of its people, it can make a meaningful contribution to thriving and sustainable societies. 

Bill Law, Volvo CE Head of Brand, Marketing and Communication, says: “The Building Tomorrow Project is not a campaign. It’s a commitment that we have lived and breathed from the very start of our business. It is an ongoing pledge from our Volvo CE family to millions around the world that we’re working to change lives for the better and provide communities with what they need to rise above societal challenges.”

Designed to fit more closely with the brand’s premium look and feel, this new design philosophy and designation policy have already won the prestigious 2020 Red Dot Product Design Award.","Rolling out from this month, new and updated Volvo branded products will now be tagged with just the product type and size on its side – and nothing else. All other product details, such as model series and model variant, will continue to be found on the specifications, brochure or PIN plate, ensuring customers will see no change in how they buy service or order parts for their products.

The real motivation behind this change is to bring the product’s branding in line with the company’s minimalist Scandinavian heritage and long-standing desire for a clean, clear and boundless human-centric design. 
CLARITY IN FUNCTION AND DESIGN
Gustavo Guerra, Design Director for Volvo CE, says: “We always strive for an honest and simple design that still emulates the smart power of our products. But we found that our brand designation did not suit the purposeful and progressive quality of our products. This new move is designed to bring more confidence and clarity not just to the operator but to everyone out on the jobsite – which is what we mean by boundless design.”

Modern construction sites are now much less focused on just the product and more focused on the construction site as a whole. With this updated product designation, Volvo CE aims to create a clearer line of communication for all parties, from the operator out on the job site right through to the back-office function. A rise in new technologies also brings with it a necessary increase in inter-generational product updates, so eliminating the need to change the product name for every update, no matter how big or small, ensures the branding stays clean, simple and purposeful.

“We are at a crossroads where new and traditional ways of working are coming together,” says Gustavo. “As developments in electric, autonomous and connected technologies grow side-by-side with our continued need for diesel equipment, we will soon see the level of product updates also growing exponentially. It’s a time of change for the industry and our branding structure should reflect that too.”
THE FIRST MODELS LAUNCHED WITH NEW DESIGNATION
Whether it is a modification to the cab, operator controls, product frame or technical function, each edit will no longer carry with it long and cumbersome model names when the update is brought to the market. Effectively this means removing the revision status and product specification from the external visual identity and leaving just the product abbreviation and product size. All technical details are communicated as normal on PIN plates and marketing materials. The first models launched with the new designation policy are the first two Electric models of ECR25 and L25 and the ECR58 generation F – which recently won the prestigious Red Dot Award for product design. The award is the most globally recognized mark for industrial design quality. In their statement, the jury said that they were “impressed by the balanced construction that incorporated not only the cabin but also the exterior and the user experience.”

This new design philosophy will have minimal impact on the way customers buy their products, order parts or take them in for servicing. In exactly the same way as today, customers will still be able to look to the specifications on the PIN plate in order to find the detailed configurations required for aftermarket services, parts ordering or repairs.

The change is being introduced on all new and updated models during a staged roll-out from this year forward, set to take until around 2025. 

“This is not just a renaming initiative,” says Gustavo. “This is our design philosophy, a principle that guides us through the creation of the next generation of construction products. A key part of our role is to help our customers navigate the shifting digital landscape, and offer clear and open communication to better manage these times of change.”"

Gencor has announced that they plan to continue the manufacturing of the Blaw-Knox paver line in south-central Pennsylvania and move to a location in Letterkenny Township.

The deal, which is expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2020 will allow Gencor to manufacture and develop Volvo CE’s current North American paver product line and market it under the Blaw-Knox brand. Gencor has announced that it will continue marketing and servicing the Blaw-Knox paver line through selected Volvo CE dealers in North America. 
BRAND WITH A LONG LEGACY
The Blaw-Knox brand dates back over a century when in 1917 Blaw Collapsible Steel Centering Company merged with the Knox Pressed and Welded Steel Company. The firm made its first road paving equipment in 1929 and the brand has since gone on to build an enviable reputation in the paving segment in North America.

Gencor Industries, Inc., is the leading manufacturer in North America of asphalt plants, soil remediation plants, combustion systems, and heat transfer systems to the road and highway construction industry. 

“Gencor is a strong player to take on the Blaw-Knox paver range, as it has extensive expertise in the asphalt industry and a good reputation for quality and customer success,” commented Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. “We see this agreement as being a win-win for us and Gencor. It maintains a valuable product offer to Volvo CE customers, as well as securing dealer distribution and servicing of Blaw-Knox branded paver products in North America.”

Marc G. Elliott, President & Director of Gencor Industries, also commented, saying: “With our already strong position in the asphalt industry, this acquisition will afford Gencor access to the venerable brand of Blaw-Knox, and provide an entry into the hot mix paver segment. We are committed to the long-term growth and development of the Blaw-Knox brand.”"

Adjusted net sales in the second quarter decreased by 14%, amounting to SEK 22,876 M (SEK 26,814 M in Q2 2019). Higher sales in China did much to compensate for lower sales in all other markets. Operating income was also impacted, at 3,108 M was down from the 4,153 reported in the same period the year before, equating to an operating margin of 13.6% (15.5%).
Despite the impact of the pandemic on sales, the second quarter 2020 saw order intake increase by 11%, driven by a strong demand for the company’s SDLG branded machines, which were up by 31%. Notwithstanding that most factories in Europe and the Americas were shut down for a month during Q2, a result of countrywide lockdowns and supply issues, deliveries increased by 8% in Q2.
Market development
The year up to the end of May saw both the European and North American markets, measured in units, shrink by 22%, while the Asian market (excluding China) reduce by 21%. The Chinese market has recovered strongly, and was up 13% at the end of May. The South American market was also in positive territory, up by 8% at the same point in the year.
“While demand for construction equipment in both Europe and North America was weak during the second quarter we were able to leverage our strong position in China, which rebounded strongly in the period,” commented Melker Jernberg, Head of Volvo Construction Equipment. “This is allowing us to act from a position of relative strength and to drive transformational technologies that are moving our industry to more sustainable solutions. We are continuing to invest in electrification, automation and connectivity.”

By Press Information,6/30/2020,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2020/volvo-ce-wins-sustainability-award-from-the-european-rental-industry/,VOLVO CE WINS SUSTAINABILITY AWARD FROM THE EUROPEAN RENTAL INDUSTRY,"Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has scooped the Best Sustainable Rental Project of the Year Award for its Energy management, at the 2020 European Rental Awards.","The awards, which are organized and judged by the European Rental Association (ERA), were announced yesterday, June 30, in the European Rental Awards event that took place digitally this year hosted by International Rental News. 

This independent recognition from the rental industry is a testament to the company’s long term focus on sustainability, and outstanding ability to achieve significant environmental sustainability improvements. The energy management initiative that secured the award, is just one of the many projects in the company’s focus on environmental care. The success of the program lies in building a company-wide embedded culture dedicated to avoiding waste energy and continuously improving. 

The ERA is supporting the industry evolution that today places higher value on the carbon lifecycle of construction equipment throughout the machine life, which of course begins with the manufacturer in the production phase.

Volvo CE has been a member of the WWF Climate Savers program since 2012 and its 2015-2020 commitment was about making a significant reduction in its global energy consumption and therefore its CO2 output throughout the value chain, demonstrating industry leadership and developing innovations towards a low carbon society. In the last five years, the company has: 
Implemented more than 50 GWh’s of energy savings
Switched half of its global energy supply to 100% renewable sources 
Reduced its idle electricity use by 48%
Reduced its energy use per unit delivered to its customers by 27% 
Started a journey of CO2 neutral production facilities – Braas, in Sweden, is already 100% neutral factory since 2014
Niklas Nillroth, Vice President Sustainability & Public Affairs at Volvo CE, says: “Volvo CE’s purpose is to build the world we want to live in, so we are extremely proud to win this award which recognizes our sustainability efforts towards that goal. Our energy management approach has delivered significant benefits to the rental industry at a product lifecycle level, and we believe that the cultural approach taken can be shared and adopted by rental companies of all scales and sizes.”"
By Press Information,6/23/2020,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2020/volvo-autonomous-hauler-wins-red-dot-award/,VOLVO AUTONOMOUS HAULER WINS RED DOT AWARD,The TA15 – part of the TARA autonomous transport solution from Volvo Autonomous Solutions – has won a coveted Red Dot Award for product design – the most globally-recognized mark for industrial design quality.,"The revolutionary TA15 autonomous electric hauler from Volvo Autonomous Solutions has wowed a panel of design experts in Essen, Germany, to win a Red Dot Product Design Award 2020 – a seal of high design quality from the world’s largest and most distinguished design competition.

Commenting on the award, Nils Jæger, President at Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said: “We are thrilled to have won such a prestigious award as the Red Dot. It shows that we are delivering world class designs at the cutting edge of autonomous vehicle technology. We are proud to continue the Volvo Group tradition of being innovative leaders in the commercial vehicle and machine design arenas.”
AUTONOMOUS ELECTRIC ECOSYSTEM
The battery-electric load carrier is a new machine concept, compared to traditional off road hauling, and forms one element of Volvo Autonomous Solutions’ TARA transport solution. It is designed to disrupt today’s off-road hauling. 

The hauler runs on a battery-electric drivetrain based on shared technology from the Volvo Group. The automation system uses GPS, Lidar, Radar and multiple sensors. Being autonomous, the TA15 has no need for a cabin – making for a dramatically new machine profile. 

With a 15 tonne hauling capacity, TA15 forms part of the wider TARA autonomous transport solution concept, so that a series of them can be connected together to form a ‘train’ of machines, for maximum loading and hauling efficiency. The TA15 will be a critical element of the TARA electric and autonomous transport solution.

The autonomous electric hauler was, and will continue to be, developed by Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) based on the former HX02 concept and has now been handed over for commercialization to Volvo Autonomous Solutions, a new business area of the Volvo Group. Operational since 1st January 2020, Volvo Autonomous Solutions’ objective is to ‘accelerate the development, commercialization and sales of autonomous transport solutions, as a complement to the Volvo Group’s current products and services’. Volvo CE also won a Red Dot award itself this year, for a machine that, due to the Coronavirus outbreak, will be introduced to the market later this year. 

“It is exciting that two Volvo products have been awarded this internationally recognized mark of design excellence,” says Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. “On top of that, it is great that this is the result of a great internal collaboration with Volvo Autonomous Solutions. Partnership is the new leadership.”"

Dozens of Volvo CE machines are on site building the reservoir, set to be ready in 2023. Watch the whole story in the new episode of The Megaproject Listing: Restoring the Everglades.","Since 1882, the Everglades have been drained for farming and it is now half the size it was a century ago. But that’s changing. One of largest ecosystem restoration projects in the U.S. in currently underway. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan began 20 years ago and is a giant hydrological restoration project consisting of, among other things, the build of a new basin storage reservoir in the Caloosahatchee estuary, called the C-43 water reservoir project. When complete the reservoir, which is spread over 40km2, will hold excess water from a nearby lake, where it will be treated and then released during the dry season. In total the dam will be able to hold 200 billion liters of water.
UP TO THE CHALLENGE 
Working on a construction project virtually the size of Manhattan comes with its share of dilemmas. And the hundreds of canals that have to be navigated during both rainy and dry seasons, pose even more challenges. Massimo Bugliosi, Project Director with Lane Construction-Salini Impregilo, is the one in charge of solving these issues. He says preparation is essential and relies on the dependable performance of Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) machines. 
There are currently 42 Volvo CE machines working on the construction of the C-43 water reservoir in the Everglades – part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.

Volvo CE machines are versatile and up to the toughest of challenges.
“The key is planning and properly sequencing activities in the right way, and the equipment must be versatile – Volvo machine are up to the challenge,” he says. 

Currently, there are 42 machines from Volvo CE working on the C-43 water reservoir project. This includes a mix of A45 articulated haulers, and EC750E 75-ton excavators– with more on the way. 

“We chose to use Volvo equipment, because it is versatile and can handle the mixes of different kinds of soil,” explains Massimo Bugliosi.

Another challenge is something that no-one can rule over. The weather in South Florida can be rough and unpredictable – not to mention hurricanes coming to visit annually. But this is no surprise to the guys at Lane Construction-Salini Impregilo, who are well aware of the necessary precautions.
A TANGIBLE DIFFERENCE
The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan will boost the quality of life for humans and wildlife alike. The Everglades is home to more that 350 species of birds, 50 unique reptiles – and that’s not all. Every year more than one million visitors, from around the world, flock to the Everglades, helping to drive a rich economy in tourism and recreation. This natural reservoir also provides drinking water for southern Florida’s local population – of 8 million. This ecosystem restoration venture is a huge step towards creating a sustainable future where human expansion no longer poses a threat. 

“To have the opportunity to serve as an essential supplier on a project of substantial environmental impact; is something we all strive for,” says Stephanie McCall, Vice President Key Accounts, Region North America. “Knowing that Volvo CE and our local dealer Alta Equipment is working to preserve the Everglades water estuaries and wildlife ecosystems for generations to come is by far the most rewarding work we could be a part of. ”

By Press Information,4/23/2020,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2020/sales-slip-17-in-volvo-ces-first-quarter/,SALES SLIP 17% IN VOLVO CE'S FIRST QUARTER,"Demand stalled in the first quarter as measures to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic took hold. Despite a recovery in the Chinese market in March, the quarter still saw sales down by 17% and order intake reduce by 7% during the period.","The rapid deterioration of global demand caused by measures in society to contain the spread of the Coronavirus had a negative impact on Volvo Construction Equipment’s (Volvo CE) first quarter 2020 financial results, with sales, profitability, deliveries and orders all showing reversals during the period.
During the first three months of 2020 Volvo CE saw net sales decrease by 17% to SEK 20,148 M (SEK 24,155 M in Q1 2019). At SEK 2,678 M operating income also slipped, down from SEK 3,646 M in the same period of 2019. Earnings were impacted by lower machine volumes and an unfavorable machine mix. This was reflected in the operating margin, which at 13.3% was slightly down on the 15.1% in the same period the year before.
Order intake decreased by 7% in Q1 2020, although demand in China – the world’s biggest market for construction equipment – increased towards the end of the quarter. Deliveries were down, by 13%, to 20,170 machines, compared to 23,139 machines in Q1 2019.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
The major global construction equipment markets of Europe and North America were both down in the first quarter, declining 1% and 2% respectively in the first two months of the year. In Asia (not including China) demand was down by 4% compared to the same period last year. The impact of the Covid-19 virus was more pronounced in China, which fell 44% during the period, due to market disruption. China did see a rebound in March, with demand up 2% compared to the same month in 2019, thanks to government stimulus measures aimed at boosting infrastructure development. 

“The measures to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic began affecting our operations in China in February, and had a severe impact in mid-March, when our global supply chain was disrupted and production halted in most parts of our operations,” commented Volvo CE’s president Melker Jernberg. “It is clear that we are now entering a tough period, with both production stops and low demand having a negative impact on our profitability. That said, we take confidence in the fact that our customers are active in businesses that are important to society, and that our products and services are vital in building sustainable infrastructure for the future.”

By Press Information,3/9/2020,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2020/volvo-ce-introduces-compactor/,VOLVO CE INTRODUCES COMPACTOR WITH INDUSTRY-LEADING 4800 VPM,The new DD128C compactor from Volvo Construction Equipment has the highest frequency in the industry resulting in greater productivity whatever the job.,"The new DD128C compactor delivers the fastest rolling speeds whilst maintaining proper impact spacing to provide the most productive rolling train available. No longer do you need to trade-off smoothness for productivity – you can get both with the DD128C.

Featuring a 2,000 mm (79 in) wide drum with chamfer and radii drum edges, the DD128C offers the high compaction performance and reliability expected from a Volvo machine. This machine also features a large 1400 mm (55 in) diameter drum and auto-reversing eccentrics – an automatic function that ensures eccentric rotation in the direction the machine is traveling, for unparalleled smoothness. It is also equipped with an industry-leading, automatic drum wetting system that provides speed-dependent water flow to minimize water usage and ensures uniform drum coverage to prevent material pick-up.

Offering Volvo’s exclusive eight amplitude eccentric system, the DD128C has the widest range of amplitudes (0.08 – 0.8mm or 0.003 – 0.03in) on the market. This allows for unmatched versatility whether the job is an ultra-thin lift or a deep 10 cm (4 in) lift. Utilizing Volvo’s patented technology to detect the amplitude setting, vibration frequency is automatically adjusted to the highest vpm available for the amplitude setting – so operators can get the highest rolling speeds and best productivity without compromise.
THE POWER TO PERFORM
The DD128C is powered by an advanced 110 kW(148 hp) Volvo D4 Tier 4 Final engine, which delivers high torque at low rpm, ensuring high-quality performance with minimal noise and fuel consumption. Engine operating speed during work mode is a scant 1,850 rpm providing the torque and power needed without the noise and fuel draw. Fuel efficiency is further enhanced with optional auto-idling and auto-engine shutdown features that deliver premium performance. The engine and hydraulics are designed to work together to provide quick eccentric start times and exceptional drum performance in the most demanding conditions.

SAFE, EASY OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE 
Safety is paramount on all jobsites, which is why the Volvo DD128C compactor has unobstructed visibility along with a host of advanced safety features. The ROPS/FOPS certified platform, all-around visibility, adjustable seat w/adjustable seat back and 180-degree rotating console all provide superb visibility of the jobsite, as well as unobstructed sightlines to the mat for excellent rolling precision. Ergonomically positioned controls, noise and vibration isolation, and ample space keep the operator alert and focused. Drum surface and spray nozzle visibility allow the operator to ensure consistent water flow and utilize the fully redundant backup system if a nozzle were to clog.

The DD128C’s intelligently designed swing-up hood allows for unobstructed access to the engine and hydraulic components, enabling easy maintenance, while a single key accesses all service doors. Passive regeneration occurs automatically, without requiring input from the operator, and a service regeneration is carried out by technicians as part of the routine 500-hour service. For added convenience, the water tank can be filled from ground level.

With Volvo’s CareTrack telematics system, road crews are never on their own. The system can remotely access a range of important compactor information, including geolocation, fault codes, and service and maintenance planning.

OPERATOR EFFICIENCY FEATURES: A HELPING HAND
Equipping the DD128C with Compact Assist, Volvo’s unique Intelligent Compaction System, provides the operator with real-time feedback on compaction status, helping them maximize productivity. Pass mapping provides a clear view of where work has been done, and which areas require more attention. While temperature mapping ensures operators are compacting the asphalt before it cools. Compact Assist with Density Direct TM reveals the density of the mat in real-time, giving operators confidence that their targets have been met. All the job data is stored and made available on the machine or over the air with job report summaries and data sets ready to be submitted. The Compact Assist operating system utilizes the award-winning, 10-inch Volvo Co-Pilot on-board interface. 

The Impact Spacing Meter from Volvo provides a visual reference of speed control to maintain proper impact spacing, resulting in consistent smoothness. The DD128C can also limit machine speed to maintain proper impact spacing automatically making the roller operator’s job easier. With these features at their fingertips, operators can unlock the full productivity potential of Volvo compactors and ensure exceptional mat quality.

“The DD128C is our best compactor yet,” explains Chad Fluent, Global Product Manager - Compactors. “This is the most productive, fuel-efficient, and versatile machine we offer.”"

Volvo CE has taken this basis to heart with its ingenious new EC300E Hybrid, now available for order in North America and making its regional show debut at ConExpo-Con/Agg 2020 in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
  Unlike other systems that capture the swing energy of an excavator’s superstructure to electrically assist the engine, Volvo’s novel hydraulic hybrid takes ‘free’ energy generated by the boom down motion and uses it to reduce fuel consumption.
  The powerful and regular boom-down motion charges 5.2 gallon (20 litre) hydraulic accumulators, which then deliver energy to drive hydraulic assist motors that help power the hydraulic pump. There are the same levels of controllability and performance as the standard EC300E, including the ability to work in ECO Mode and Hybrid Mode simultaneously.

The hydraulic hybrid uses ‘free’ energy generated by the boom down motion and uses it to reduce fuel consumption.
RAPID PAYBACK IN DIG AND DUMP APPLICATIONS
All this simple and uncomplicated capability takes load off the engine and in the process delivers up to 15% lower fuel consumption and 12% less CO₂ emissions than a conventional machine. When used in high production ‘dig and dump’ applications - especially those within a 90° swing - the fuel saving payback is approximately two years – and all with no loss of performance.

Not only is the idea simple – the componentry is too – consisting of just a few add-on components that are simple to maintain. At this time, the hybrid system is not availble for aftermarket installation.

Technologies such as this are another example of Volvo CE delivering on its commitment to innovate and develop more sustainable and cost effective solutions for customers."

PEAK PERFORMANCE
Volvo’s optimized hydraulics deliver constant high pressures across each phase of the digging and lifting cycle. The hydraulic system increases pump power for fast and smooth operation, while the electro-hydraulic system controls on-demand flow and reduces internal losses in the hydraulic circuit. The EC950F also comes with a boom-swing priority valve which adjusts the priority of hydraulic flow between boom-up and swing so that truck loading cycle times can be set to truck loading working conditions.

Volvo’s unique ECO Mode helps the EC950F achieve outstanding fuel efficiency while the integrated work mode allows operators to choose the best work mode for the task at hand: select from I (Idle), F (Fine), G (General) and H (Heavy).

To boost machine versatility, the attachment management system can store settings for up to 20 different attachments, enabling the operator to pre-set hydraulic flow and pressure through the in-cab monitor.
OPERATOR’S CHOICE
The sure-footed and solid machine features a wide track gauge, long track length and retractable undercarriage, with an optimized counterweight which can be removed for ease of transportation.

Smart features such as the optional Dig Assist – powered by Volvo Co-Pilot – assist the operator in digging more efficiently. The low-noise and spacious cab, featuring straight travel pedal, further boost comfort. For added visibility, the EC950F comes fitted with rearview camera and can be equipped with Volvo Smart View, which provides 360° vision. 

Convenience and safety are enhanced thanks to a large entrance, including high visibility handrails and conveniently positioned steps, as well as anti-slip plates. The optional FOG (Falling Object Guard) and FOPS (Falling Object Protective Structure) provide further peace-of-mind when working in tough applications. 
MAXIMUM UPTIME
Machine protection is provided by features that include a heavy-duty boom and arm, strong frame structure, heavy-duty underside plate and floating pins on the bucket connection, as well as optional full-length track guard. Like all Volvo excavators, the EC950F is backed by the Volvo Lifetime Frame and Structure Warranty, which covers the frame, boom and arm for the entirety of the initial period of ownership. 

For a prolonged bucket lifespan, Volvo offers a range of wear parts. To cut downtime to a minimum, the new Volvo Tooth System enables teeth changes in minutes: simply place, push and click. Essential maintenance points are easily accessed via the wide-opening and conveniently located compartment doors using central and surrounding walkways.

The EC950F is eligible for ActiveCare Direct™, free for a year, on new purchases. The Volvo remote telematics service provides 24/7/365 active machine monitoring and fleet utilization reporting directly from Volvo. If a machine requires attention, Volvo communicates directly with your local dealer so they can respond quickly. In addition, customers receive a report to identify areas to improve worksite efficiency, avoid unplanned downtime, and catch problems before they occur.

Built for both heavy commercial and light highway tasks, the machines offer easy maintenance and strong performance coupled with serious fuel savings.

“The P5110B and P5170B give contractors a new heavy eight-foot size class option, meeting demand for mid-size pavers that fall between our existing P4410B and 7000B series models,” says Bill Laing, Product Manager, Road Products at Volvo CE. “We also integrated adaptive Volvo engine speed technology into the 5000 series to give high productivity at a very low 1200 rpm. This results in lower operating costs day in, day out.”
PERFORMANCE IS KEY
The 5000B series is powered by the latest Volvo D6 Tier 4 Final engine, the same engine used in high production models like the Volvo L60H-L90H wheel loaders. Engine speed, torque and fuel consumption are optimized to provide the best performance and fuel efficiency, averaging 3.7 gallons per hour for the 5110B and 3.3 gallons per hour for the 5170B. Additionally, the Volvo engines have low vibration and extremely quiet operation, around 79.2 dBa.

The P5110B and P5170B pavers are fitted with a large capacity hopper to ensure continuous paving, while durable rolled wings help prevent material build-up and cut cleaning time. Once loaded, sonic sensors regulate the flow and delivery of material. The P5170B also has the option of front wheel assist for added traction and grade-ability. 

Both models come with an UltiMat160 screed, which features extensions that can adjust paving width hydraulically from eight feet up to 16 feet. The screed’s front-mounted extension supports head-of-material control in the auger channel, further ensuring a quality finish. The screed’s optional bolt-on extensions provide high quality paving up to 18 feet wide. They can also be added or removed quickly, thanks to Volvo’s quick coupling system.

These models also simplify serviceability thanks to ground-level access to common service areas, filters, hydraulic test ports and fuel/DEF tanks. Greaseless bearings in the auger and conveyor and wear parts in the hopper that are easy to access and replace also make servicing these machines easy.
SUPPORT YOU CAN COUNT ON
The P5110B tracked paver and P5170B wheeled paver are backed by the Volvo Lifetime Frame and Structure Warranty, which covers the tractor frame on both machines and the track frame on the P5110B for the entirety of the initial period of ownership. They also come with one year of ActiveCare Direct®, Volvo’s advanced telematics service that provides 24/7/365 active machine monitoring and fleet utilization reporting.
THE DETAILS MATTER
Other features that support productivity and efficiency include:

“The Service Commitment further supports our goal to be the No. 1 uptime provider in North America,” says Stephen Roy, Senior Vice President, Americas at Volvo CE. “The Service Commitment will be our blueprint for ‘getting it done’ with unmatched communication, responsiveness and expertise from both Volvo and our dealers.”
FOUR PILLARS SUPPORT THE PLEDGE
Volvo is the first manufacturer in the industry to make this specific type of commitment, which is based on four pillars:
Uptime — Volvo products and services will help customers maximize uptime, while customers will also take confidence in our sense of urgency and commitment.
Responsiveness — Service will be available 24/7, customers will have parts when and where they need them, service appointments will be scheduled promptly, and machine issues will be diagnosed quickly and effectively.
Expertise — Customers will work with knowledgeable service and parts personnel from Volvo, and problems will be resolved correctly on the first time. 
Communication — Customers will be kept fully aware of warranty coverage, the status of service work and service and parts expectations.
“This level of service is what our customers already expect from us and our dealers, and this commitment is our way of inviting customers to let us know if we’re not delivering,” says Scott Young, Vice President of Uptime and Customer Support at Volvo CE. 
The commitment is designed to be a blueprint for 'getting it done'.
Customer feedback through surveys and conversations with dealers will help the Volvo network continually improve upon the Service Commitment. “The direct comments from the customers will go to our dealers and Volvo as the manufacturer so we can better understand our customers’ priorities and improve in the ways they need us to,” says Scott. 
THE TOOLS FOR SUCCESS
Volvo CE has been laying the foundation for success with the Service Commitment over recent years, and future product and service innovations will expand on it. 

Volvo has markedly strengthened its North American dealer network through acquisitions and territory realignments. These dealers have a deep knowledge of their local markets and solid success in providing a high level of customer service.

Uptime statistics have measurably improved over the past couple of years, thanks in part to ActiveCare Direct™, Volvo’s advanced telematics service. Less than 1% of machines being monitored via ActiveCare Direct turn into critical machine-down cases. This is hard proof of the OEM-monitored system’s effectiveness at pre-empting and correcting issues before they become a problem for the customer. 

In terms of responsiveness, Volvo’s parts distribution footprint has grown with the opening of a new distribution center in Toronto in 2019 and expansion of another in Reno, Nevada, scheduled to go live in early 2020. 

For improved communication, Volvo will continue to invest in technologies that allow technicians, dealers and customers to communicate more efficiently in the field, such as mobile apps.

The tree farm and landscaping company has been a Volvo customer for 34 years with a strong focus on sustainability and openness to new technologies related to environmental aspects. The highly-skilled operators at Leick Baumschulen use compact wheel loaders daily for a wide range of jobs – from pallet handling and loading material to grading and sweeping. 
“This variety of tasks makes it the perfect real-world scenario for us to test our new electric compact wheel loader together with our customer,” says Paolo Mannesi, global compact wheel loader product manager for Volvo CE.

Having already invested in electric golf carts to comfortably show customers around its large yard and display area, Leick Baumschulen wanted to explore the advantages of electrification for its fleet of construction equipment too. 

The owners of the company, Christoph and Michael Leick, strongly believe in electrification and see the benefits in line with their entrepreneurial thinking. They feel it is a big recognition from Volvo to be part of such development and are happy to know that they can contribute to future products with the experience they have in their segment.

The Volvo L25 Electric is powered by lithium-ion batteries that cover an eight hour working shift with one single charge in the machine’s regular applications, which include light infrastructure work, gardening, landscaping and agriculture. The L25 also incorporates two dedicated electric motors – one for the drivetrain and one of the hydraulics. Decoupling the subsystems has led to higher efficiency across the entire machine.
The L25 Electric in action at the customer site.
ALL THE POWER, NONE OF THE NOISE
Leick Baumschulen operators’ first impressions of the Volvo L25 Electric are that it functions much like a conventional diesel-powered machine but with the benefits of electrification.

“It is a product with the right performance and great design. The machine operates like a conventional wheel loader, but with improved comfort for the driver and surroundings – it feels similar when it comes to power but is quieter has less vibration, less maintenance and is emission-free locally,” says Christoph Leick, co-owner of Leick Baumschulen

For Leick Baumschulen the quiet operation of the Volvo L25 Electric is among its biggest advantages.

“We also operate the machine to transport plants in our show area where customers are coming in and out. With this machine, it is more comfortable for our customers and our employees as the noise level is much lower. This means we can keep our conversation and discussions going with our customers when the machine is operating nearby,” he says.
MINIMAL MAINTENANCE
The other main benefit for the company is its ease of maintenance.

“The machine requires less maintenance as it has no engine – we don’t need to check the engine oil and coolant every day or refill fuel. We simply charge it overnight, which is very easy. You just need to plug one end of the charger into the machine as well as the other into a normal household socket. That’s it. There’s actually nothing you can do wrong – it is easy and safe,” he continues.
Mannesi says: “We are really satisfied with the machine performance when it comes to the power, the very low noise level and driver comfort. In some areas it even exceeded our expectations.
  Volvo CE and Leick Baumschulen team exploring the machine features.

“I’m really proud of the team at Volvo CE for all the hard work they have done to make the L25 Electric possible. We can see that the really good teamwork gets reflected in the Project as well as in the Product. It’s so great to see the machine now working at a customer’s site and how it makes their daily job easier and more comfortable. That’s what we get out of bed for.”

The Volvo L25 Electric compact wheel loader is currently being tested by Leick Baumschulen in a pilot phase. The machine will be available for general sale from mid-2020 when Volvo CE will stop the development of new diesel engine-based L20 to L28 compact wheel loader models.

The company continued its R&D efforts during the period and used the quarterly results to announce the next phase of its program to launch an autonomous electric hauler. 
Net sales in the third quarter decreased by 4% to SEK 17,921 M (18,598). Operating income was also slightly down, at SEK 2,180 M, compared to SEK 2,587 M in the corresponding period in 2018. This equated to an operating margin of 12.2% (13.9%). Profitability was hampered by brand, market and product mix, as well as higher R&D and selling expenses.

Net order intake in the third quarter decreased by 9% compared with the same quarter in 2018. Deliveries decreased by 2%, to 16,460 machines.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Up to the end of August, the European market was up 4%, driven by stable growth in Russia, Germany, Italy. North America saw an increase of 7% over last year, thanks to demand for large excavators, haulers and wheel loaders. South America was up by 10%, driven by growth in Brazil. In Asia (excluding China) the total market was down 11% from last year, spread across all markets. The Chinese market was 7% above last year, thanks in part to increased sales of compact excavators.

“After several years of high market levels, demand for construction equipment is slowing down,” commented Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. “Although many markets are coming off their previous high levels, we expect the underlying need for infrastructure development in many markets to support the industry in the longer term.”
COMMERCIAL PILOT FOR AUTONOMOUS ELECTRIC HAULER
Volvo CE also announced that it has signed a contract for the first commercial pilot of its autonomous battery-electric load carrier. The trials will be conducted with customer Harsco Environmental in Sweden, and represent the next stage in the process of industrializing the technology.

Volvo CE’s new collection of powerful short films – the ninth in the Megaproject Listing series – highlights the social impact of the global trade strategy, formally known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Set to promote regional integration and economic co-operation across countries in Asia, Africa and Europe, the $90 billion project began in 2013 and involves connections by road, rail and sea, running from China in the east to London, UK in the west. Its construction in Kazakhstan, the setting of this Megaproject, is a key part of the initiative, where a rail hub called the Khorgos Gateway is being built in the middle of the desert. 

There are more than 400 Volvo machines working as part of 24 separate projects along the New Silk Road – including here in Kazakhstan.

Volvo CE is working on 24 projects as part of the monumental infrastructure project.
The new trade routes are expected to be a game changer for global logistic flows – and the positive effects are already being noticed. Not only are roads which were once potholed and dangerous now dramatically improved, but the speed of trade distribution has been increased and new towns are being developed so quickly that they are yet to be found on most printed maps. In Khorgos Gateway, for example, the total number of handled containers per year is set to surpass 500,000 by next year.

In addition, a large workforce is required to work along the more than 700 kilometer stretch of road in the nearby town of Usharal. As a result more than 1,500 local Kazakhs are working alongside 500 or so Chinese employees in the construction of the trade route, demonstrating incredible cross-cultural collaboration.

Excavators handover to Danish rental company GSV Materieludlejning in Kirke Hyllinge, Denmark.
At today’s handover, the machines – one EC220EL excavator, two EC250EL excavators and one ECR235EL excavator – are fitted with Volvo’s smart connectivity system CareTrack. It works by capturing thousands of machine data points, which are then monitored remotely in a Volvo Uptime Center by dedicated experts. These experts then use state-of-the-art diagnostic software to process huge amounts of data in real-time and filter back to the customer and dealer only the most essential information. 

Thanks to the collected data, wear on crucial parts can be predicted, services planned and spare parts ordered in advance – all reducing downtime for the owner, thus leading to increased productivity. Combine this with Volvo Group’s connected capabilities across the sector – trucks, buses and construction equipment – and it is easy to see how efficiencies are being unlocked across the value chain.

Dan Vorsholt, CEO of GSV Materieludlejning, says: “We are excited to be part of this connectivity revolution and proving what can be achieved with a first-class fleet management system. It is essential that we are able to keep track of every aspect of our business, so being able to monitor our machine productivity, right down to the second, is a major contributor to our success.”"

  Spac, part of the Colas Group, is using the 2.5-tonne excavator to dig trenches at the Saint-Nom-la Bretèche golf course, just outside of Paris, France.
  With zero exhaust emissions and almost silent operation, the Volvo ECR25 Electric is perfect for such environments.
  “It’s exciting for us to see this machine at a client’s construction site,” says Elodie Guyot, electric compact excavator project manager for Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE). “It’s in a very quiet and peaceful area where residents want that quietness and peacefulness to be respected so it’s crucial to have a machine that meets this need.”
  Benjamin Silvent, site manager for Spac says: “For residents and cities in general, it makes our worksites more acceptable because it limits carbon emissions and noise disturbance.”
  Alexandre Birot, machine operator for Spac adds: “When we talk to the guy in the trench we don’t have to yell, we talk normally and he can hear everything. With a traditional excavator we first have to turn the engine off for him to be able to hear. What’s more, when we spend the whole day in the trench, usually he would inhale a lot of fumes but now there’s no exhaust gas for him to inhale. If there were only electric machines in the company that would be amazing.” 
  The Volvo ECR25 Electric replaces a combustion engine with 48-volt lithium-ion batteries and an electric motor that powers the hydraulics to move the machine and attachments. The batteries store enough energy to power the machine for 8 hours in typical applications, such as utility work. An onboard charger enables overnight charging via a regular household plug socket.

Net sales in the second quarter increased by 10%, amounting to SEK 26,814 M (SEK 24,403 M in Q2 2018). Operating income also continued its upwards trajectory, at 4,153 M in the period, up from 3,675 M reported in the same period the year before, equating to an operating margin of 15.5% (15.1%). 
The second quarter 2019 saw order intake increase by 6%, with SDLG branded products increasing by 28%. Order intake was particularly strong in China, rising 21%, driven by strong demand for SDLG branded excavators and wheel loaders. Deliveries were up 12% in the period, again driven by growth in China and stable demand in Europe and North America. 
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
The second quarter of 2019 saw growth in Europe and North America, with a small decline in Asia (excluding China). In the period up to May, demand for construction equipment in Europe was up 5% compared to the same period the year before, while demand for large excavators, road equipment and articulated haulers pushed the North American market up 7%. South America saw demand rise 6% while Asia (excluding China) was down 11% compared to the previous year. The Chinese market saw demand rise by 8%, thanks to growth in the compact excavator segment.
 “Volvo CE continued on the path of increased sales and improved profitability in the second quarter,” commented Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. “Volume flexibility in the industrial system and tight cost control will continue to be in focus in the second half of the year.”

The first of which is an additional home for its prototype vehicles.
Volvo CE will add an extra 12 hectares to its existing 45 hectare demo ground at the Customer Center, specifically for testing of its electric and autonomous machines but also for demonstrating current machine offerings. The 8 MSEK investment in the innovation arena will enable Volvo CE to show the prototype machines to customers in a realistic and challenging environment in complete safety, supported by 5G technology and with charging infrastructure installed on site. The first phase of constructing the nearly 2 km gravel road, which runs in both open and closed forest terrain, will start in the near future.

As Volvo CE transitions to more fossil-free alternatives, the existing fleet of combustion engine machines at the Eskilstuna Customer Center will be running on HVO (hydro-treated vegetable oils). An alternative to diesel, HVO is made from vegetable and animal fats (typically rapeseed oil or abattoir waste) and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 90% depending on the raw material. No special modifications to the engines are required.
“Our new innovation arena is a big statement to customers and the industry about our commitment to building tomorrow. Meanwhile, we show with our switch to HVO that we are also taking small steps to drive sustainability, not just in the future but also in the here and now,” says Carl Slotte, President of Volvo CE Sales Region EMEA, which is headquartered in Eskilstuna.
DEVELOPING THE MACHINES OF THE FUTURE
Over at the Technology Center, Volvo CE is also investing in an electromobility and automation test track for R&D purposes. The 3 MSEK track currently hosts the HX02 electric and autonomous load carriers that in autumn 2018 were tested in the award-winning Electric Site project in a quarry outside of Gothenburg, Sweden. The HX02 models are now being optimized to be ready for the first commercial pilot which is due to start before the end of 2019.

In March this year, telecommunications company Ericsson installed a 5G mast at the Technology Center so that Volvo CE could test remote-controlled machines with extremely short response times. Launched in partnership with operator Telia, this was Sweden’s first 5G network for industrial use.
Other recent developments at the Technology Center include the opening of four new test rigs at the beginning of 2017, three of which are dedicated to the early stages of software development for electric machines.
“If we are to continue to lead our industry in the market, we need industry-leading R&D facilities to refine and develop current and future technologies. Our new test track, 5G collaboration with Ericsson and Telia, and electromobility rigs will prove an enormous competitive advantage for us,” says Gustav Edholm, Vice-President of Advanced Engineering and Core Technologies at Volvo CE.

REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Meanwhile at the axle and transmission factory, Volvo CE’s focus is on reducing energy consumption to support the company’s overall sustainability goals. The two greatest sources of energy consumption at the plant are the ‘hardening centre’, where machine parts are heated to a high temperature and then cooled to ensure a strong surface and a long life, and the ‘paint shop’, where components are heated so the paint dries.
The company has invested 5 MSEK in an energy recovery system that will conserve around 60% of the heat generated in the hardening centre and transfer it to paint shop. It is estimated that the system will decrease overall energy consumption in the factory by 4%.
Work began on installing the energy recovery system in the middle of April and will be completed by the beginning of September. Meanwhile, Volvo CE will continue to investigate new processes for the painting process to further reduce energy consumption.
“We have assembled an enthusiastic team with responsibility for tackling energy consumption at the factory,” says Anders Bergstrand, General Manager of the Eskilstuna factory. “This latest investment is just part of our sustainability journey.”
GOING FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY
“These excellent examples from the Eskilstuna site are part of our roadmap towards becoming a carbon neutral and landfill-free site,” says Anne Bast, Vice-President of corporate communications, who is responsible for driving sustainability strategy in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa). “But we can do more. It is in our power to continue to push the boundaries of innovative and sustainable solutions for a better tomorrow. This makes good business sense for us and our customers because these solutions improve efficiency and uptime, while reducing cost – but it’s also the single most important mission we have for the future of our planet.”"

With a depth of up to 392 meters below sea level, this pioneering project is the eighth exciting installment in Volvo Construction Equipment’s (Volvo CE) Megaproject Listing.","Using new bridge and tunnel building techniques and set to cut travel times in half, the complete reconstruction of the E39, along the West Coast of Norway, is at the center of a new series of films launched today – putting the people and machines behind this innovative project in the spotlight. 
Norway is well-known for its breathtaking coastline, with high mountains and deep fjords. But there’s a downside to this spectacular landscape. At the moment, the Coastal Highway Route E39 between Kristiansand in the south and Trondheim in the north is a journey of around 21 hours. Yet about a third of Norway’s 5.3 million people live along this highway, which is also an important trade route for Norwegian businesses, as some 60% of the country’s export goods are produced on the West Coast. In addition, when the E39 leaves Norway it proceeds to Denmark, making it an important entry point to the rest of Europe. 
  And if – like Håvard Langåker, a truck driver for Vassbakk & Stol – your job means driving this stretch of coastline, then things can be hard. “I go and get the rocks at the construction site and then I drive it to the other sites in need of material,” explains Langåker. “On the road I need to wait for ferries, stand in ferry lines, deal with cancelled ferries and narrow roads. We have island and fjords with roads which follow the coastline. It takes the longest way, not the shortest, therefore it is quite time consuming.” But all this is about to change.
  This pioneering project along the Norway coast is set to cut travel times in half.
Costing US$39 billion, the reconstructed Coastal Highway Route E39 will reduce the journey time between Trondheim and Kristainsand from 20 hours to just 11. And the Rogfast Tunnel, set to be complete in 2026, is a big part of this improvement. Set to be the longest and deepest subsea road tunnel in the world, it will stretch 27 kilometers in length and 392 meters below sea level at its deepest point. 

But building tunnels at this depth poses a challenge. In order to make the journey as safe as possible for road users, construction will include the building of two separate tunnels for traffic flow. In addition, every 250 meters will be passages that connect the two tunnels, allowing for a quick and easy exit in case of emergencies.

Volvo CE will be showcasing its role in this innovative project as part of the latest installment of the award-winning Megaproject Listing. Tiffany Cheng, Global Director, External Communications, at Volvo CE, says: “When complete, this tunnel will make the lives of people who live and work in Norway and beyond that much easier. To be a part of this exceptional project, and to have a role in improving access through this beautiful corner of the world, is a real point of pride for us at Volvo CE.”

And how will they perform? After inviting members of the public from around the world to come up with their own inventive concepts, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) and LEGO® Technic are displaying the incredible results for the first time in FutuRE:BUILD. This exclusive exhibition is coming to London Transport Museum in the heart of Covent Garden, London, from May 10th – 16th.
  Highlighting the technical ingenuity of budding engineers young and old, the many entries have been whittled down to the top 10 models chosen by a panel of judges. Together they showcase a broad spectrum of technologies, including driverless automation, 3D printing, solar panels and drones. Inspired by the futuristic vision behind the LEGO® Technic Volvo Concept Wheel Loader ZEUX – entrants were asked to build their own models using at least 50% existing LEGO® Technic bricks. And once the wheels were set in motion, the public’s imaginations went wild.
  Arvid Rinaldo, (Brand Communication & Partnerships) at Volvo CE, says: “We were overwhelmed with just how far people went with their creations. The best-in-show were picked because they prove that the boundaries of our future construction machines are seemingly limitless. Some of these designs look like they have come straight out of a sci-fi movie. We are at an exciting point in time for the industry and these models are actually not too far removed from what could be coming to our construction sites of the future.”
  The sheer breadth of concepts on display serve as inspiration to future generations of engineers.
  Runner up prize-winning model Volvo ICARUS, by James Cox, is a mobile solar power plant with advanced off-road capabilities.
The grand prize winner – Transylvanian native Vida András – is a 27-year-old Romanian architect who was inspired by the challenge of finding an environmental solution to construction machines and presenting that in the most elegant way. His self-driving model, the Volvo Rottweiler is fitted with a pneumatic drill, a dozer and a 3D printer – making it capable of autonomously taking on any construction challenge in the most hard-to-reach places.

He says: “To me, the design is not just about playability, it’s about really exploring the potential for future technologies. In my industry, 3D printing is one of the biggest trends at the moment, so I wanted to incorporate that into my model. I have 20 years’ experience playing with LEGO sets. I’ve loved it forever and have always had this confidence that I could sit down and build for hours and eventually it would all come together in the end.”
Runner up prize-winning model Volvo Excavadrone, by Marco Pirola, works on both land and in the air.
A panel of judges, including members of LEGO® Technic and Volvo CE, critiqued the entrants on a number of factors: overall coolness and originality, most inspired details, relevance to the contest theme and best use of LEGO elements. A truly diverse competition, winners range in ages from 14 to 47 and come from all corners of the globe from the UK to Hungary and the USA to South Africa. Other models on display include Volvo ICARUS, a mobile solar power plant with advanced off-road capabilities, and The Volvo Excavadrone built to operate on land and in the air.

Sam Mullins, Director for London Transport Museum, says: “We’ve all enjoyed the imaginative play of LEGO bricks and I am sure our visitors will be thrilled to see these fantastic, futuristic creations. As well as offering a great day out, one of the key things we do at London Transport Museum is to turn childhood enthusiasm into a career in engineering. These driverless diggers will certainly inspire young minds. And budding young inventors should also pop into our Future Engineers gallery after exploring the new FutuRE:BUILD exhibition.”"

  Pump It Up was the launchpad for Volvo CE’s Excavator For Any Challenge campaign – a brand initiative to boost awareness of Volvo CE’s excavator offering to a wider consumer audience. To do that, the film needed to be fun, funky and on point to an audience who knew little or nothing about construction equipment. With currently over 50 million views, the film surpassed even the wildest expectations, going truly viral as well as appearing in printed media around the world. The campaign is being supported by an ongoing series of marketing initiatives, aimed at boosting Volvo CE’s market share of the global excavator market.
  Revealing the toughness and intelligent engineering behind Volvo’s full range of excavators, the film tests the limits of heavy equipment during an exhilarating and entertaining army boot camp, led by mean drill instructor Dolph Lundgren.
FUTURISTIC FUN
The Volvo Concept Wheel Loader ZEUX came about following a number of fun and informal team building workshops in Billund, Denmark, the home of LEGO® Technic.
The result was a game-changing model that combines automation and drone technology. The model itself then went on to influence the creation of a number of potentially revolutionary patents for the construction industry.
“We are thrilled to accept these awards. A team of Volvo marketeers, operators and designers worked seamlessly to make these ideas come to life. Some of the stunts in Pump It Up, like the pull-up exercise, have never been attempted before on screen,” said Mats Bredborg, Head of Brand and Market Communication for Volvo CE.
“I’m very proud of all the hard work that the teams put in. We look forward to another year of successful projects at Volvo CE.”"

It marks its very first job since it was unveiled to a global audience earlier this month.
  Designed and created by garden designer Chris Beardshaw, The Morgan Stanley Garden considers how resources can be managed more sensitively throughout the creation of the show garden. Chris and his team have sourced a range of environmental materials and building methods to create this year’s garden – the start of which will be the ECR25 Electric.
  Chris says: “We are incredibly proud to debut Volvo’s electric excavator during the creation of this year’s garden. RHS Chelsea Flower Show offers the perfect arena to showcase the machine because it is such an intense work zone right in the heart of London so reducing exhaust emissions and lowering the noise levels is an absolute game changer.”
  The machine will be working hard over the next week and a half where it will be excavating the site and trenching for tree pits and a central water feature. Once the job is complete it will then be moving on to its next big project where it will be used in one of the first customer pilots for Volvo CE’s electric compact product range.
The zero-emissions compact excavator, the first in Volvo’s pledge to commit to a line of electric compact machines, at its launch in bauma.
Because the machine is electric, no particulate matter, nitrogen oxide or carbon dioxide is released into the environment. In addition to zero exhaust emissions, it also delivers significantly lower noise levels, reduced energy costs, improved efficiency and less maintenance requirements, compared to its more conventional diesel counterparts. Capable of operating for eight hours of work at a time, it will be charged overnight using the show’s electricity grid.
Ahcène Nedjimi, Electromobility Specialist at Volvo CE, says: “What greater way to showcase the true potential for electric machine technology than on this global platform. Volvo CE has always been committed to delivering zero emissions in the construction industry and now we are fulfilling this promise with a machine that represents a brighter future not only for our industry, but for society as a whole. This exciting project is the best possible demonstration of how we are driving forward sustainable innovations with our partners across any and every task, big and small.”
There are more than 157,000 visitors set to attend the five day-long RHS Chelsea Flower Show when it opens to the public on Tuesday, May 21 – all of whom are there to see cutting-edge garden design and the latest horticultural trends. Designer Chris Beardshaw has a strong reputation at the event, having received seven Gold Medals and four BBC People’s Choice Awards and last year was awarded Best in Show for The Morgan Stanley Garden for the NSPCC (UK children’s charity).
And this year’s garden in the heart of London is a fitting setting for Volvo’s cleaner, quieter and more efficient machine.

During the first three months of 2019 Volvo CE saw net sales jump by 15% to SEK 24,155 M (SEK 20,914 M in Q1 2018). These higher sales, plus improved prices and product mix, helped to positively impact operating income, which rose to SEK 3,646 M, up over a quarter (26%) compared to the SEK 2,888 M posted in the first quarter of 2018. This was reflected in operating margin, which also saw strong improvement, at 15.1%, compared to 13.8% in the same period the year before.
Deliveries were also up 5% during the period, to 23,139 machines, compared to 22,102 machines in Q1 2018.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT
The major global construction equipment markets of Europe and North America both saw growth in the first quarter, growing 3% and 4% respectively in the first two months of the year. The European market was driven by good demand from Germany, the UK and Italy, while growth in North America was boosted by growing demand for large wheel loaders, road equipment and articulated haulers. A recovering Brazil helped demand in South America rise by 5% during Q1, while Asia (not including China) slipped 4% compared to the same period last year. China, meanwhile, delivered stronger demand than expected, rising 23% compared to the first quarter of 2018. 

“The global market for construction equipment remained good in the first quarter,” commented Volvo CE’s President Melker Jernberg. “We are successfully managing these increases in volumes, and this good cost control is helping to deliver encouraging levels of operating income and operating margin.”

  Cairo has been Egypt’s capital for 1,000 of the country’s 5,000 year history, is located close to some of the world’s most renowned and ancient heritage sites and is currently home to some 23 million citizens – more than a fourth of Egypt’s entire inhabitants. The city’s dense population has created some of the worst traffic congestion in the world, with the average citizen spending anywhere from four to five hours stuck in traffic every day. And the problem is only set to worsen as the population is projected to reach 40 million by 2050. The government’s solution is simple: move the capital. 
  In this episode released today, Volvo CE will showcase its role in building the new capital. The city will stretch over 700 km2 – about the size of Singapore – and have 21 residential districts, 2,000 schools and colleges as well as 1,250 new mosques and churches. It will also be the first smart city in Africa, with solar parks and electrified transportation. In a country where 96% of the population are crammed into 4% of the land – a new city of this stature next to a treasure trove of valued antiquities is a welcome addition.
  Volvo machines building Egypt's new capital.
Egypt’s ancient construction feats are still marveled at today. But unlike The Great Pyramids of Giza – which took an estimated 85 years to build – this modern-day megaproject has risen from the sands in record time. Construction of the new capital began in 2017 and is set to be completed in 2022. Furthermore, most of the government buildings are scheduled to move into the new city as soon as June this year.

The machines, which are the first to be shown from a new electric range of Volvo branded compact excavators and compact wheel loaders, deliver zero exhaust emissions, significantly lower noise levels, reduced energy costs, improved efficiency and less maintenance requirements, compared to their conventional counterparts. From mid-2020, Volvo CE will begin to launch its range of electric compact excavators (EC15 to EC27) and wheel loaders (L20 to L28), stopping new diesel engine-based development of these models.
ECR25 Electric.
ELECTRIC OPERATION
To make the ECR25 Electric and L25 Electric, the combustion engines have been replaced with lithium-ion batteries. The ECR25 is fitted with lithium-ion batteries and one electric motor which powers the hydraulics in order to move the machine and the attachment. The machine’s batteries store enough electric energy to power the ECR25 Electric for eight hours in its most common applications, such as utility work. The L25 Electric incorporates lithium-ion batteries which allow for eight hours of operation in the machine’s regular applications, including light infrastructure work, gardening, landscaping and agriculture. The L25 Electric also incorporates two dedicated electric motors, one for the drivetrain and one for the hydraulics. Decoupling the subsystems has led to higher efficiency in both the systems and the entire machine. Both the ECR25 and L25 Electric have onboard chargers that enable overnight charging via a regular household plug socket. A fast charging option, requiring more powerful grid access, will also be available.

“The ECR25 and L25 Electric are revolutionary machines that demonstrate Volvo CE's commitment to future technology,” says Scott Young, Director Electromobility and Automation. “As the machines are electric, no particulate matter, nitrogen oxide or carbon dioxide are released into the environment. This, together with the fact that they have extremely low noise levels, makes them ideal for use in cities and densely populated areas.”
L25 Electric.
FROM CONCEPT TO REALITY 
The launch of the ECR25 and L25 Electric follow positive reactions to Volvo CE’s concept machines over the last few years. This includes the prototype EX02 fully electric compact excavator and the prototype LX02 electric compact wheel loader. “While the ECR25 and L25 Electric are different machines, the learnings from these research projects have helped to build the foundations for the new range of electric compact machines,” explains Young. “The technology we have been developing is now sufficiently robust and this, together with changes in customer behavior and a heightened regulatory environment, makes now the right time to launch our electric compact machines.”

Now that the first electric compact machines have been unveiled, a number of machines will be used and tested by customer’s in pilot projects before production begins mid-2020.
INNOVATING FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE 
“Unveiling our first commercial electric machines marks a significant moment in Volvo CE’s journey towards building a more sustainable future,” says Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. “In line with the Volvo Group’s strategic focus on electromobility in all business areas, we are driving leadership in electromobility and delivering sustainable solutions that support customer success. The electrification of construction equipment will produce cleaner, quieter and more efficient machines – this represents the future of our industry.”"
By Press Information,4/9/2019,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2019/increased-uptime-thanks-to-volvo-active-care/,INCREASED UPTIME THANKS TO VOLVO ACTIVE CARE,"The global rollout of Volvo ACTIVE CARE is another unique industry first by Volvo CE. It takes the number-crunching out of machine telematics – thanks to the combination of fleet monitoring and comprehensive, actionable machine reports. ","With the rise of onboard telematics and remote connectivity it’s easy for fleet managers to become overwhelmed by the mass of data being produced by modern construction machines. With Volvo Construction Equipment’s (Volvo CE) unique Volvo ACTIVE CARE now set to be offered globally, Volvo proactively takes on the burden of monitoring and reporting machine health, leaving customers more time to focus on their operations. Volvo ACTIVE CARE is an intelligent telematics service that bundles together the monitoring of machine health and the provision of weekly reports that together help reduce downtime. 
Remote analysis delivers multiple benefits, including catching problems before they become failures and helping smooth service scheduling. By knowing what the problem is, dealer technicians need to make fewer trips to the customer site and arrive with the right tools, parts, and expertise to increase the opportunity for a first visit fix. This all amounts to increased uptime and reduced cost for the customer.
HOW IT WORKS
The process is simple: machine data points are captured via CareTrack – Volvo’s telematics system – and monitored remotely via machine-to-machine connectivity by Volvo Uptime Centers around the world. Here dedicated Volvo experts who really understand the machines use state-of-the-art diagnostic software to process the information. When a critical alarm or a fault on a machine is detected, the dealer is informed, along with diagnostics information on the fault. The dealer then notifies the customer about the issue and plans when the corrective action can be performed. 
Fortunately critical issues are a rarity, but customers are regularly reassured that their machines are being constantly monitored via weekly Uptime reports. These reports highlight areas of opportunity to increase the availability of an individual machine – or fleet of machines.
Insightful weekly reports.
WEEKLY INSIGHT, LONG-TERM IMPACT
The greatest benefit of Volvo ACTIVE CARE and the dedicated Uptime Centers is that a customer no longer has to spend time digging for the insights among a mass of machine information — that’s being done on their behalf by Volvo and their Volvo dealer. 
This more regular interaction helps Volvo, the dealer, and customers work together to identify actions that can greatly impact one of the biggest drivers of profitability – uptime.

“Through Volvo ACTIVE CARE, we are strongly committing to ever higher uptime,” says Koen Sips, Vice President Customer Solutions at Volvo CE."
By Press Information,4/9/2019,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2019/new-application-puts-haulers-on-the-map/,NEW APPLICATION PUTS HAULERS ON THE MAP,"The latest update in a suite of applications offered for the Volvo Co-Pilot interface, Haul Assist now features a real-time tracking map that helps improve hauler fleet traffic flow on site, along with the efficiency-boosting On-Board Weighing feature.","Maps do so much more than helping you get to your destination. The new Map feature on Volvo’s updated Haul Assist application now allows operators to monitor the hauler traffic around the site and proactively adjust their driving according to traffic conditions, especially around load and dump zones.
SEEING AROUND CORNERS
Operated via Volvo Co-Pilot — the award-winning in-cab interface with a 10-inch high-resolution touch screen — Haul Assist’s Map functionality allows operators to not only identify their position but also the position of other haulers fitted with the technology. This knowledge comes into its own on sites with restricted visibility, allowing operators to see where other haulers are, thereby reducing potentially dangerous situations. In all circumstances, being able to monitor traffic flow helps operators anticipate the optimum arrival time at load or dump areas, thereby avoiding congestion and waiting times, and improving overall site efficiency.
A new real-time tracking map helps improve hauler fleet traffic flow.
STAYING IN TOUCH
The application works by using the hauler’s in-built GPS function for positioning purposes and combines it with a digital connection via Volvo Co-Pilot to communicate with other machines. The system can also record how fast the hauler is travelling and emit an alert to remind operators to maintain a safe working speed.

The Map function can plot out haul roads and preferred routes to help operators navigate their way around the site. It can highlight when the hauler is approaching a pre-defined section of narrow or single lane road, and even visualize meeting/passing areas. The map can also highlight any reference points or notable areas of the site. 
ON-BOARD WEIGHING
Load and dump zones can not only be visualized on the map, but can also trigger certain sub-functions, such as activating On-Board Weighing information. On-Board Weighing helps to optimize the haul cycle by ensuring every hauler journey moves the correct payload. The highly accurate system eliminates under-loading for good productivity and over-loading that increases machine wear and fuel consumption. 
The system can help monitor production against targets.
The system monitors the amount of material moved, providing useful data and a real-time view of the productivity of each hauler. This can help when monitoring the production against targets for each project. The addition of Map enhances On-Board Weighing even further, giving the ability to include GPS coordinate data in its reports, allowing the ability to measure material moved from-and-to different coordinates.
DATA BECOMES INFORMATION 
Haul Assist’s ability to capture and store detailed production information in Volvo Co-Pilot gives a real boost to the efficiency of the operation. The data can be exported over the air to a cloud portal or via a USB storage device, and used to create a report, either manually or automatically – on a daily or weekly basis.
Data can be exported manually or automatically.
VOLVO CO-PILOT – APPLICATION INTERFACE
Built on the Android operating system, Volvo Co-Pilot is designed in a way that makes it easily scalable as future software updates, additional functionality and new applications are developed. The system is 3G-compatible when equipped with a SIM card, allowing for the system to automatically and wirelessly receive software updates without any required action from the owner or operator. 

In addition to Haul Assist, Volvo Co-Pilot also serves as the interface for several other applications, including Load Assist, a complete load weighing management system for Volvo wheel loaders, as well as the Volvo Intelligent Compaction system, Compact Assist with Density Direct™, which offers the industry’s first and only real-time density mapping tool, available exclusively for Volvo asphalt compactors.

Now with greater fuel efficiency and improved hydraulics, the EW60E makes light of a wide range of excavator tasks.
Among the new features is a new hydraulic main control valve that offers additional functionality. When a higher hydraulic flow is required for a particular movement, the main control valve is able to combine the flow of several pumps to optimize the machine operation. Particularly for grading, flow can be combined into the arm cylinder to make arm speed faster. Not only is the EW60E now more versatile, it is also more efficient. This comes courtesy of a new engine management feature – ECO mode. Fitted as standard, ECO mode lowers the engine speed – but without any impact on performance, resulting in reduced fuel consumption.
GO WITH THE FLOW
For high controllability, productivity and a comfortable operating experience the EW60E is equipped with responsive controls that ensure smooth movements, as well as adjustable hydraulic flow. Four-wheel drive and a top speed of 30kmph guarantee excellent mobility on and off road. Well-balanced driveline, and the front axle locks while working for optimum stability. An optional fixed boom and offset boom provide versatile performance in a range of operations from confined jobsites to major construction areas.
  The EW60E is equipped with a number of features.
The new Volvo engine complies with forthcoming Stage V regulations. With the auto engine shutdown option – a unique offering from Volvo – the engine stops automatically after a pre-selected time, lowering fuel costs and noise. A consequence of the engine being inactive is reduced maintenance costs and improved resale value of the machine.
  The EW60E is equipped with a number of features combined to increase machine availability and reduce downtime. Ground level service access and convenient greasing points reduce service time and maintenance costs. Service intervals can easily be monitored via the in-cab screen, which shows reminders when maintenance is needed.

The EC60E’s highly responsive controls ensure the machine does exactly what the operator intends for fluent movement throughout operation. The operator can set the machine to their own style and to suit the job at hand for easier control and increased performance. The auxiliary hydraulic flows, electric dozer blade and boom offset speed can be adjusted by the operator and tailored to three different work response modes –‘Active’, ‘Normal’ or ‘Soft’.

The EC60E is fitted with an upgraded hydraulics system that features a new design of main control valve. Offering the operator additional functionality, when a higher hydraulic flow is required for a certain movement, the main control valve can combine the flow of several pumps to optimize the machine operation. Particularly for grading, flow can be combined into the arm cylinder to make arm speed faster.
The machine is built to fit any job site.
MULTI-FUNCTION TOOL CARRIER
For outstanding versatility, the EC60E can be equipped with a wide range of durable attachments that are suitable for a wide range of applications, including utilities, building, agriculture, landscaping and forestry. These attachments can be easily changed to save time and reduce costs, and the machine’s design, hydraulics, piping and in-cab switches combined with the Volvo attachments range to allow the EC60E to take on a variety of tasks with ease.

The addition of either a mechanical or a hydraulic quick coupler allows attachments to be changed quickly and efficiently. A complete range of buckets from general purpose reinforced buckets to ditching buckets is available, allowing the machine to work on a wide range of applications. Volvo’s durable hydraulic breakers are fully compatible with the EC60E. The wide range of breaker tools (or bits) has been built to break all kinds of material and combines excellent performance with low noise and vibration levels. The machine can also be equipped with the Volvo thumb, designed to work with both Volvo direct fit buckets and quick coupler to make many tasks possible, including piling, placing, loading, lifting and carrying.
The quick coupler allows for a variety of applications.
LOWER COSTS, GREATER UPTIME 
The Volvo engine and improved hydraulics work together to offer superior fuel efficiency. With the auto engine shutdown option – a feature offered by Volvo alone – the engine stops automatically after a pre-selected time, lowering fuel costs and noise. Helping to lower fuel bills further is the standard-fit ECO mode. When activated, the function slightly decreases the engine speed – but not performance, resulting in lower fuel consumption. A stopped hour meter reduces maintenance costs and increases the resale value of the machine.

Volvo CE has taken this idea to heart with its ingenious new EC300E Hybrid, which is now entering field testing. Unlike other systems that capture the swing energy of an excavator’s superstructure to electrically assist the engine, Volvo’s novel hydraulic hybrid harvests ‘free’ energy generated by the down motion of the excavator’s boom and uses it to supercharge the hydraulic system. 

The powerful and regular boom-down motions charge 20 litre hydraulic accumulators, which then deliver energy to drive hydraulic assist motors that help power the hydraulic pump. There are the same levels of controllability and performance as the standard EC300E, including the ability to work in ECO mode and Hybrid mode simultaneously.
Volvo’s novel hydraulic hybrid harvests ‘free’ energy generated by the down motion of the excavator’s boom.
RAPID PAYBACK IN DIG AND DUMP APPLICATIONS
All this simple and uncomplicated cleverness takes load off the engine, and in the process delivers between 10-12% lower fuel consumption, up to 12% less CO2 emissions – and all with no loss of performance. When used in production ‘dig and dump’ applications (esp. those with a 90o swing) the payback of this simple approach can be a little more than a year. The machine provides the same levels of controllability and performance you would expect from the equivalent conventional machine, and up to 17% fuel efficiency improvement dependent on application.

Not only is the idea simple – the componentry is too – consisting of just a few add-on components that are simple to maintain.
This technology helps take the load off the engine.
While not commercially available yet, EC300E Hybrids are currently undergoing field tests at customer sites in order to validate the technology in real world applications.

Technologies such as this are another example of Volvo CE delivering on its commitment to innovate and develop more sustainable and cost effective solutions for customers. "
By Press Information,4/9/2019,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2019/top-grades-at-top-speed-with-volvo-active-control/,TOP GRADES AT TOP SPEED WITH VOLVO ACTIVE CONTROL,"With its automated boom and bucket movements, the new Volvo Active Control creates a semi-autonomous excavator that achieves the perfect grade at a touch of a button.","Who wouldn’t want to make creating the perfect grade easier? For novice operators it’s difficult to get the depth and angle just right, and for experienced operators it can be a bit…well… repetitive. Fortunately, both operators can now celebrate, thanks to an ingenious new automated grading machine control system from Volvo Construction Equipment.
Initially offered on the new EC220E crawler excavator, but soon to expand more widely through the range, Volvo Active Control is a machine control system that is operated via the 10 inch in-cab Volvo Co-Pilot tablet. The system guides the operator through the functions in order to automate the digging process. Once the required parameters of the job are entered into the system and the job launched via a button, the excavator automatically adjusts the boom and bucket movements to make precise cuts, follow the desired shape and deliver exactly the right angle of grade – all in a radically shorter timeframe.
A BETTER JOB IN HALF THE TIME
The benefits of the system are unquestioned. Such is the speed and precision offered that grading times are almost halved (45%) compared to conventional grading. And there is zero need for rework, because the system gets it right first time. Safety is also improved, as the system is so accurate that a second person is not needed to take depth/grade checks.
A wholly Volvo designed system, Volvo Active Control is powered by the company’s Dig Assist application, and uses ‘drive-by-wire’ technology to control the excavator’s electro-hydraulic system. With Volvo Active Control in charge to automatically adjust boom and bucket movements, the operator can achieve the perfect job one-handed – with only the left hand needed to control arm speed.
TAKE THE WORRY OFF YOUR MIND
The technology allows for a number of functions to deliver the perfect grade.
Volvo Active Control manages a number of functions to deliver the perfect grade – but also ensures hazards are avoided. A depth limit feature stops the bucket digging below a pre-set limit, thereby avoiding collision with known underground utilities. A height limit, meanwhile, helps prevent bucket, boom or stick colliding with power cables, ceilings etc. by setting a pre-set safe elevation. Finally, a swing fence prevents the machine hitting obstacles to its side. And loading trucks can be made easier, thanks to a swing position control that allows the operator to pre-program the location of the pile and the truck.
Even servicing is improved, as there are no hydraulic pilot lines to worry about – helping boost machine uptime further."

Designed for use with Volvo CE’s wheeled and crawler excavators, integrating Trimble Earthworks on Volvo excavators complements the Volvo Dig Assist capability to enable the use of 3D constructible models, as-built data, remote support, design and asset management, and other Trimble Connected Site® technologies. 
MACHINE CONTROL: KEY TO FUTURE OF AUTOMATION
Using the Volvo Co-pilot as the primary user interface, there is no need for additional monitors and sensors. All that is needed is the download of the Trimble Earthworks application and the installation of an additional CPU. When Co-Pilot with Dig Assist is ordered, all the hardware that is needed is fitted onto the machine at the factory. For 3D, a customer can order Volvo Trimble Earthworks Grade Control Platform to also be factory fitted. The Volvo excavator then works seamlessly with the Trimble Connected Site ecosystem.
  Integrating the Trimble Earthworks 3D grade control solution on Volvo excavators complements the Volvo Dig Assist capability. The addition of 3D functionality allows 3D constructible models to be wirelessly imported to the display in the cab of the machine. Ideal for larger, complex infrastructure projects, 3D designs can be imported into multiple excavators so everyone is using the same model. The user interface will also be familiar to those using Trimble solutions.
CUSTOMER CHOICE – INTEGRATED AT THE FACTORY
""The Volvo Co-Pilot provides the perfect machine control interface,"" said Jeroen Snoeck, Director of Connected Site and Machine Services at Volvo CE. “Many customers already have a 3D and surveying supplier preference. Since we don’t see ourselves in the surveying and 3D design businesses, we are happy to collaborate with leading technology partners such as Trimble. And that’s how we deliver our customers the best of both worlds: Their well-known Trimble solution integrated with the factory integrated Volvo Dig Assist and Co-Pilot platform.
  “Working with Volvo on an integrated 3D grade control solution showcases the benefits both companies bring to our mutual customers,” said Jean Francois Sourdoire, Trimble Business Development Manager for EAME. ""The tight integration of Trimble Earthworks with Volvo Dig Assist gives contractors a way to more easily adopt construction technology for faster ROI.”
  Trimble and Volvo are conducting global customer validation testing in preparation for the international release later in 2019."

Offered for Volvo wheel loaders between L60 to L350, and for Volvo excavators from 14 tonne capacity up to its largest 95 tonne machine, the new tooth system digs deeper and stays sharper for longer. The low profile design offers greater penetration capability and higher bucket fills, offering quicker cycle times and as much as an extra 20% more penetration over the life of the tooth – boosting productivity and extending effective tooth life. The design also features a more self sharpening design, further helping to reduce fuel consumption.
FITTING GEOMETRY
Protected welding, stronger adaptor nose and clever design helps give the system added robustness, while the system’s greater durability means longer change intervals and reduced bucket wear. Because they are designed exclusively for these Volvo machines, the teeth and adaptors are specifically matched to the specification, size and model of machine. 
Featuring smooth surfaces in critical areas, the new tooth system helps to distribute stress while working. With the optimum balance of wear protection and weight, the tooth system has been engineered to unlock the potential of these machines – delivering maximum performance, breakout force and uptime.
The new tooth system helps to distribute stress while working.
PLACE. PUSH. TWIST.
The ultimate in wear parts, even the best teeth need to be replaced eventually, but changing teeth with Volvo’s new generation tooth system couldn’t be easier – or faster. A true hammer-less system, the teeth feature a new locking system that has a reusable locking pin. Offering excellent fit and retention – and an auto-tightening effect once fitted, the reusable pin locks into place simple by twisting it a quarter turn. Taking just a few minutes, installation couldn’t be simpler – place, push and twist – that’s it.
THE RIGHT TOOTH FOR THE TASK
There are five types of tooth available for the excavators: general purpose, abrasive material & rock, pick point, twin pick and spade nose. There are two adaptor types offered, and also an optional mechanical wear cap available, which fits on the standard adaptor and extends tooth life further. For wheel loaders there are three types of tooth available – general purpose, abrasive material and rock, along with three types of adaptor.

By Press Information,3/29/2019,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2019/volvo-ce-exceeds-wwf-energy-savings-target-two-years-early/,VOLVO CE EXCEEDS WWF ENERGY SAVINGS TARGET TWO YEARS EARLY,Volvo CE has already surpassed its 2020 energy saving target as part of a global commitment with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).,"More than two years ahead of schedule, Volvo CE has achieved its end of 2020 WWF Climate Savers commitment, aimed at reducing the amount of energy the company produces in its plants. 
  The company had originally planned an ambitious target to save 40 gigawatt hours (GWh) across its factories from 2014 to 2020. But in fact, employees have already saved a total of 44 GWh – enough energy to power almost 1,500 houses for an entire year.
  Johan Wollin, Global Director for Energy Management, at Volvo CE, says: “It was an ambitious target, but we were confident we could achieve it. This represents a significant improvement in production site energy efficiency and has also helped to reduce our energy bill by 10 million SEK each year. If we add the non-energy benefits the accumulated savings over the last five years have contributed with more than 100 million SEK in cost savings.” 
SHARING BEST PRACTICE
Volvo CE has achieved its target thanks to a determined effort across its global manufacturing facilities.
In Pederneiras, one of Volvo CE’s primary production hubs for Latin America, everyone is fully behind the initiative. Volvo CE Safety Engineer Cláudia Rocha, says: “This is important because without their support, it would be hard to implement things such as skylights for daylight harvesting. It’s not just management, though – every employee has a role to play in cutting down on energy use. We are encouraged to submit improvements and keep an eye on actions relating to sustainability.” 
Meanwhile, with more than 300 pieces of large production equipment and 110,000 m2 of floor space, reducing energy usage in Volvo CE’s plant in Eskilstuna, Sweden, isn’t easy. “By being more conscious of idle electricity, and making small changes to everyday behaviors, we’ve managed to save more than 10 GWh,” explains Boris Radojcic, Energy Leader, at Volvo CE. “All of the improvements we’ve made so far have been achieved with either no investment or a very small one.”
REDUCED ENERGY = REDUCED COST
While this achievement will inevitably reduce the company’s wider environmental impact, there are also other added benefits. 
Birgitta Sjögren, Project Manager from the IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, says: “The most obvious benefit is the cost reduction associated with using less energy. Volvo CE has managed to achieve something positive for the environment. In addition to this, working with energy efficiency has brought about many non-energy benefits, which have helped to improve safety, quality, and productivity. Lastly, by making continuous improvements in the area of energy management, we are also training the organization to work with continuous improvements in all other areas. The energy use of a plant tells you a lot about its overall level of operational excellence and we can see potential for future improvements.”
“Starting this year, all plants have been challenged to continue the improvement rate of 2% energy reduction per year by 2023,” concludes Johan. “We are also being more ambitious with regards to idle electricity by revising the current 15% target down to 12% in 2020 and then further to 10% in 2022. Today, we have at least three plants that are already below 10% such as Changwon, Pederneiras, and Bangalore. Together, we will continue to participate in energy saving activities and, ultimately, help Volvo CE to achieve its mission to become the world leader in sustainable transport solutions.”
Editor’s note: Volvo CE has been a member of the WWF Climate Savers program since 2012, following the Volvo Group. The Climate Savers objective is to recognize corporate leadership on climate solutions. The Volvo CE commitment 2015-2020 focus on energy efficiency throughout the value chain, demonstrating industry leadership and developing innovations towards a low carbon society. It includes driving the Construction Climate Challenge – The Construction Climate Challenge (CCC) is an initiative hosted by Volvo Construction Equipment to promote sustainability throughout the entire construction industry value chain and provide funding for environmental research."

Volvo CE will then become one of the first in the world to use 5G technology to test remote-controlled machines and autonomous solutions.","The 5G network will be used at Volvo CE’s research and development facility at Eskilstuna to further develop solutions for remote control of construction machinery and fully automated solutions. It will also be used to increase understanding of how connected machines can create added value for the customer. 
“Automation has several levels and having 5G is an important technical support to enable us to drive development in this area. These trials in Eskilstuna will include the remote control of a conventional wheel loader but also further tests of the HX02 concept load carrier,” says Melker Jernberg, President Volvo CE.
  “We can see that the industry’s interest in 5G is considerable. Automation of the entire flow will mean new ways of working and greater gains from efficiency. But to connect business-critical machines and vehicles requires a solution that is able to handle the massive amounts of data with guaranteed connection. That is what 5G can give us. And we are proud to lead the 5G-development in Sweden together with our partners,” says Anders Olsson, CEO of Telia Sweden. 
  Even with fully-automated systems, human intervention is still needed now and again for control. Todays’ remote-control technology has a time lag that makes it difficult to control at high speed or with high precision. 5G will make remote control simpler and safer.
  “With extremely short response times, high capacity, and a high level of accessibility to the mobile network, commercial and standardized 5G technology can be used for applications such as remote control of heavy machinery in real time. This opens up new opportunities for greater efficiency, cutting costs and reducing risk in hazardous environments. 5G enables us to create a safer, more efficient and sustainable society. In cooperation with Telia and Volvo CE, we are now putting theory into practice in Eskilstuna. The 5G technology is ready for the world to switch on,” says Magnus Frodigh, Head of Research at Ericsson.
  Volvo CE, Telia and Ericsson have worked together before to deploy the latest technology to contribute to safer and more efficient mining, and in the summer of 2018, Volvo CE joined Telia's 5G partner programme. Volvo CE expects to be able to apply the lessons learned from tests at Eskilstuna to its global activities. 
  “We are testing locally in Eskilstuna, but we operate globally. Connected machines and autonomous solutions are the future. They can give our customers more efficient production, logistics, greater flexibility and safer work. By minimizing the potential safety risks and downtime associated with sectors such as mining, we can get closer to our goal of zero emissions, zero accidents and zero unplanned stops. It will be exciting to see how far 5G can take us on that journey,” concludes Melker.
  ABOUT 5G
This is the fifth-generation mobile network. Compared with 4G, 5G is faster, has shorter lag time, higher accessibility and is able to handle more connected devices at the same time. It opens up totally new areas of application within industry, key social functions and our everyday lives.

He has also challenged all employees to help the company exceed its commitment of having 25% female leaders by 2025.","To mark International Women’s Day today (March 8th), Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE), has laid down the challenge of exceeding the company’s target of having 25% female leaders by 2025. This is because he believes that diversity is a major contributor to the company’s success and it will give Volvo CE a competitive advantage in the construction industry. “Generally speaking, the construction industry is not as diverse as it should be,” says Melker. “I strongly believe that the more diverse the company, the better it is. Diversity brings huge advantages as different people bring different perspectives. That’s why I am challenging our employees to go even further and help us exceed our target of having 25% female leaders at Volvo CE by 2025. We have a lot of talented, successful and inspiring women at Volvo CE and we are committed to encouraging even more to join our company.”
LEADING THE WAY
International Women’s Day is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. The day has occurred for well over a century, since the early 1900s. 
“I believe that Volvo CE is one of the best places to work in the world and I want to encourage more women to join us here,” says Johanna Huggare, Manager Intelligent Machines Platform. “I am part of a task force to increase the number of female employees and I have also started a female leadership network at my site in Eskilstuna where we are trying to increase the number of female leaders. Volvo CE is a fantastic, progressive company, it’s so much more than a construction equipment manufacturer – we are helping to build a better world for future generations.”
CELEBRATING DIVERSITY TOGETHER
“International Women’s Day is a great moment to reflect on our own progress and recognize each other’s diverse talents,” concludes Melker. “I encourage everyone to pause, share experiences, and create a dialogue around diversity and inclusion. Celebrate what you’ve achieved when it comes to diversity and reflect on how you can embrace and include diversity in your daily business activities.”"

The treasured Sundarbans delta is home to the Bengal Tiger and proclaimed a UNESCO World Heritage Site – but is under the continual threat of devastation without urgent and long-term action.

Situated along the Bay of Bengal, the Sundarbans is home to several endangered species and 4.5 million people. Following a devastating cyclone in 2009, fertile soil was destroyed, livestock killed and the mud walls protecting the islands washed away. As a result, the area is extremely exposed to flooding with tides so dramatic that about a third of land disappears and reappears every day. The problem is also compounded by a lack of clean water in India, a country where 80% of the water is polluted.

The campaign reveals how 20 Volvo excavators have been working on the heritage site to physically build up these embankments again and ensure the land and livestock are protected from the damage caused by saltwater flooding.
The historic region between India and Bangladesh is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Blending cinematic content with a story rooted in purpose, the digital partnership will take the form of a series of short films released to a global audience during a one-month-long joint campaign. This will not only be broadcast from today as part of Volvo CE’s award-winning ‘The Megaproject Listing’ – a global digital campaign showcasing some of the most incredible construction projects from around the world – but also across National Geographic’s digital channels.

Bill Law, Senior Vice President of Communications at Volvo CE, says: “This incredible project is another step forward in our global fight against climate change and we are proud to play our part in very literally building a better world. We are delighted that we can highlight the significance of this scheme alongside National Geographic – not only do we share the purpose of building tomorrow, but this partnership allows us to deliver this message to an even greater global audience.”

","Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) ended 2018 strongly, not only posting its best set of annual financial results ever, but also helping parent company the Volvo Group achieve record results. Growth in both machine and service businesses, and increased demand from construction, infrastructure and mining in all major markets, helped Volvo CE deliver strong improvements in sales, operating income, and order intake.
In Q4 2018, net sales increased by 21% to SEK 20,323 M (16,730). Operating income rose by 19% and amounted to SEK 2,157 M (1,820), corresponding to an operating margin of 10.6% (10.9). Earnings were positively impacted by higher sales, which were partially offset by higher production costs and selling expenses. 
For the full year net sales increased by 27%, to SEK 84,238 M (66,313). Adjusted operating income increased to SEK 11,306 M (7,917), corresponding to an operating margin of 13.4% (11.9). 
MARKET CONDITIONS
Demand in Europe improved during the fourth quarter, and was up 12% by the end of November, helped by strong growth in Russia, and moderate growth in the UK, France, Italy and Germany. North America was up by 16% over the same period in 2017, helped by greater demand for excavators (compact excavators up 10%, larger excavators up 23%), while South America saw a gain of 20%, up from low levels in Q4 2017 and driven mostly from growth in Brazil. Excluding China, Asian markets were up 11% compared to last year, boosted by an improving India. The Chinese market itself was strongly up, growing by 35% above 2017, driven by greater demand for excavators (compact and general purpose) and wheel loaders. 
ORDERS AND DELIVERIES
During the fourth quarter of 2018 Volvo CE saw net order intake increase by 9%, largely driven by strong demand for SDLG branded machines in China. Order intake in Europe increased by 2% compared to the same period in 2017. In North America order intake declined by 24%, due to lower orders on medium and large machines after strong demand in Q3 and a particularly strong period in the corresponding quarter of 2017, (which saw order intake up by 86%). In Asia, order intake was up by 26%, while in South America it dipped by 5% and by 22% in Africa and Oceania.
Deliveries increased by 24% during the period, again boosted by higher volumes in China on SDLG products, and good growth in all major regions.
“2018 was a record year for Volvo CE, driven by good demand from all major regions in the construction, infrastructure and mining sectors,” says Melker Jernberg , President of Volvo Construction Equipment. “In the future, we see further potential to increase volume flexibility in the supply chain, to improve quality and to grow our service business. An even stronger service business means that we can provide better support for our customers and also better balance the cyclicality in construction equipment sales.”
During the year Volvo CE continued its drive to develop next-generation solutions, progressing its position in electrification, automation and connectivity. The company demonstrated electric machine prototypes during 2018 and, in a 10-week trial, the company together with customer Skanska tested the Electric Site concept. It is based on autonomous, electric and connected Volvo machines running in a quarry. Results showed that Electric Site can deliver significant reductions in carbon emissions as well as operator costs.
In early 2019 Volvo CE announced that it will stop developing diesel-powered smaller compact equipment in favor of fully electric machines. "

The results are now in and they are even better than expected. The tests showed a 98% reduction in carbon emissions, a 70% reduction in energy cost and a 40% reduction in operator cost. The results also indicate that the Electric Site project takes a big step towards helping Volvo CE achieve its future vision where work sites are ten times more efficient, with zero accidents, zero unplanned stops and zero emissions. Together, these results support the potential for a 25% reduction in total cost of operations. However, at this stage, the reduction in total cost of operations is just a prediction. As the prototype machines are part of a research project and are not commercially available, it is impossible to give a guaranteed figure.
  “Over the last ten weeks, we’ve made incredible progress, learnt a lot and seen huge potential in the Electric Site solution’s environmental, efficiency, safety and cost benefits,” says Uwe Müller, Chief Project Manager for the Electric Site at Volvo CE. “In fact, we have decided that we want to learn more, so we will extend our test period with Skanska until the end of the year. The results we have seen so far confirm that this research project is a step towards transforming the quarry and aggregates industry and creating emission-free quarries.”
A POWERFUL PARTNERSHIP
Volvo CE and Skanska revealed the results from the Electric Site research project in front of customers, dealers and the media
The Electric Site project aims to electrify each transport stage in a quarry – from excavation to primary crushing, and transport to secondary crushing. It incorporates electric and autonomous prototype Volvo CE machines, new work methods, and site management systems, which together form a complete site solution. New technology encompasses machine and fleet control systems and logistic solutions for electric machines in quarries.
  “With climate change reshaping our industry, we need to find new, sustainable solutions and build partnerships with organizations that have different competencies,” says Anders Danielsson, President and CEO of Skanska. “Our ambition is that this collaboration with Volvo CE will help us and our customers to reduce our carbon footprint. The power of partnership will make it happen.”
PROTOTYPE MACHINES IN FOCUS
The Electric Site project involves eight HX02 autonomous, battery-electric load carriers, which transport the material from the primary mobile crusher up to the secondary static crusher. When it came to energy use per ton, the HX02s proved that they could help Volvo CE take a big step towards achieving its future vision where work sites are ten times more efficient. The second-generation prototypes incorporate shared technologies and components from the Volvo Group. They use a lithium ion battery to power two electric motors which drive the machine; the hydraulics are driven by an additional electric motor. The HX02 is fitted with a vision system, which allows it to detect humans and obstacles in its vicinity. It can follow an adjustable, pre-programed GPS path.
The LX01 prototype electric hybrid wheel loader delivered more than a 50% improvement in fuel efficiency at the quarry, as well as significant reductions in emissions and noise pollution, compared to its conventional counterparts. Its job was to organize the piles of material at the site. The LX01 is a series hybrid that incorporates a driveline that consists of electric drive motors mounted at the wheels, electric-driven hydraulics, an energy storage system, a significantly smaller diesel engine and new machine architecture, including a new design of the lifting unit. It’s this combination that enables the substantial gain in fuel efficiency.
  The EX01 70-ton, dual-powered, cable-connected excavator prototype loaded the primary crusher at the quarry. The base machine for the EX01 is a Volvo EC750 crawler excavator that has been upgraded to incorporate an electric motor in addition to the diesel engine. At the quarry, the machine was plugged into the grid, so zero emissions were emitted. If the cable is connected, the EX01 will automatically start in electric mode. If it’s not, it will start in diesel mode. The EX01 is operated in exactly the same way as a conventional Volvo excavator.
The fleet of HX02 autonomous, battery-electric load carriers
BUILDING TOMORROW, TOGETHER
“At Volvo CE, we believe in a sustainable future and we are doing our best to build the world we want to live in,” concludes Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. “The Electric Site is one example of how we are trying to achieve this. With this research project we are combining intelligent machines, automation and electromobility to challenge traditional ways of working in the quarrying industry and explore new alternatives. We will now further mature the technologies involved and the reliability of the concept. Developing, testing and validating prototype machines with a customer at an early stage in the process speeds up development and ultimately brings more value to us and our customers.”

Now a brand-new city is being built from scratch to ease the boom town’s accelerated urbanization.","In the fifth episode of The Megaproject Listing, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) breaks ground on construction of the New Santa Cruz – a sibling city just 20 minutes outside of Santa Cruz – which is being built to house more than 370,000 new inhabitants and 10,000 new businesses. An unprecedented model for urban development, the scheme is designed to further boost economic growth and become a symbol for sustainable urban planning.

Fueled by profits from oil, gas and food production and advantageously bordering Brazil and Paraguay, Santa Cruz is now close to almost three million residents. It is the 14th fastest growing metropolis in the world and its urban sprawl is set to expand even further with a doubling of its population over the next 15 years. The city’s rapid growth, coupled with its strategic location in the heart of Latin America and an expansive infrastructure network, has led to the conception of an urbanization masterplan.

Volvo CE’s latest cinematic campaign confronts the reality of increased population growth head on by showcasing the first seeds of an ambitious megaproject in the heart of the Global South. Through a series of short films, Volvo CE is inviting viewers to take a closer look at the people and numbers behind this innovative construction project and offering a unique insight into a largescale operation to tackle global urbanization.

Bolstered by a $2.5 billion investment and led by developers La Fuente Group, New Santa Cruz will be made up of 700 hectares of commercial space, 3,000 hectares of housing and a further 2,500 hectares of green space. The multi-dimensial site will combine the need to accommodate commercial trade with the need to provide sustainable living and will make use of existing connections from the Viru Viru international Airport, the Bolivia Brazil railroad network and major highways in and out of the country.
Construction of New Santa Cruz is being carried out in phases with the groundwork for the first phase only just beginning. More than 100 Volvo machines, among them compactors, wheel loaders and excavators, were chosen to lead on construction because of the machines’ ability to operate in Bolivia’s conflicting climates – suited to both the high and dry conditions in La Paz and the wet lowlands of Santa Cruz.

Tiffany Cheng, Global Director, External Communications, at Volvo CE, said: “This inspiring project is a prominent example of the way our cities are evolving in the modern age. Not only is New Santa Cruz destined to transform the region and become a hub for economic trade, but it will stand up to the pressures of increasing population growth. Urbanization is a challenge for us all, but Volvo CE is proud to be a part of the solution”

Here are four things you might not know about the quarry and aggregates business, from what the future has in store to the various uses inactive quarries can take on.","1. IT’S BIGGER THAN YOU’D THINK
Quarrying and aggregates is big business in virtually every part of the world – and market figures suggest it’s only getting bigger. Experts predict that between 2018 and 2026, the market for construction aggregates will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 6.8%. With this kind of growth, the industry will naturally become more valuable, too. According to Future Market Insights, it will be worth $468.2 billion by 2024. As well as contributing to the global economy, the industry is also a major employer. It is estimated that the quarry and aggregates industry employs more than 4 million people worldwide. 
  Asia Pacific is the largest region of supply, accounting for around 65% of the total market in 2017. China, which is also the world’s biggest producer of coal, gold and most rare earth materials, was the largest aggregates producer last year, accounting for around 42% of the total market.
2. IT’S NOT JUST STONE THAT GETS QUARRIED
Broadly speaking, quarried materials include sand, gravel, clay, dimensional stone and crushed stone – the latter of which is estimated to hold a significant share of the total market revenue. These materials are used directly in construction and are also key ingredients for manufactured building materials, such as asphalt and cement, making them an integral component in the construction of our roads and buildings. To create one kilometer of road 10 meters wide, for example, could use over 500 loads of crushed stone from Volvo CE’s R100E rigid hauler.
3. THE FUTURE IS ELECTRIC
Right now, Volvo CE is working on one of the biggest breakthroughs the industry has ever seen. Together with its customer Skanska, Volvo CE is testing the world’s first ‘emission-free’ quarry. This is part of the company’s ‘Electric Site’ research project, which aims to electrify each transport stage in a quarry – from excavation to primary crushing, and transport to secondary crushing.
  Three concept vehicles are being tested at the Electric Site: the HX02 (an autonomous, battery-electric load carrier), the EX01 (a dual-powered, cable-connected excavator) and the LX01 (an electric hybrid wheel loader). Although these machines are still in the prototype phase, they could potentially deliver up to a 95% reduction in carbon emissions and up to a 25% reduction in total cost of operations.
4. DISUSED QUARRIES ARE SURPRISINGLY USEFUL
There are roughly 500,000 extraction sites worldwide, producing up to 50 billion tons of aggregates. When quarries are put out of action, they don’t go to waste – and some go on to have surprising uses. A conservation project in the UK by the Royal Society for the Preservation of Birds (RSPB) turned 50 abandoned quarries into nature reserves packed with grassland, woodland and wetland that would be home to more than 50 ‘at risk’ species. A disused limestone quarry in Dalarna, Sweden, has been transformed into a concert venue playing host to acts including Led Zeppelin and Patti Smith. Other fascinating reinventions include a former granite quarry turned soccer stadium in Portugal.

The 80s powerhouse behind films including Rocky IV, Universal Soldier and The Expendables drives the action in a cinematic display of man against machine.
  Click here to watch the film.
  In the film – a comic nod to the action movies that Dolph Lundgren is renowned for – a line-up of Volvo excavators weighing between 1.5 to 95 tons are put through their paces in an exhausting assault course.
  During a series of extraordinary stunts, the machines are seen pulling Dolph Lundgren atop a huge concrete block across an unknown desert location, flipping gigantic tires across a muddy track and taking part in what is thought to be the world’s first ever excavator pull-up – fulfilling the film’s final message that they really are ‘excavators for any challenge’. All of this is set to the iconic beat of the 1989 hit song ‘Pump up the Jam’ by Belgian music group Technotronic.
  Bill Law, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications at Volvo CE, said: “This is a good demonstration of the flexibility and strength of our excavators, from the small to the mighty. The result is a feel-good mini movie with Hollywood impact. Some of these stunts are a little out of the ordinary, but we wanted to be daring and set ourselves a challenge to push them further. Our excavators work hard every day at construction sites all over the world, something that requires precisely that power and stamina, together with skilled operators behind the wheel.”
  Dolph Lundgren has starred in major Hollywood productions for more than 30 years and is currently enjoying a surge in popularity thanks to leading roles in new Hollywood blockbusters Creed II and Aquaman, both out later this year. With a background in engineering and a scholarship to the renowned US university MIT, he is well matched against the brains and brawn of Volvo’s excavator range.
  He said: “This job was probably the most unusual role I’ve ever taken on. It was fascinating to see Volvo’s excavators and its skilled operators performing all the various physical exercises - with absolutely no movie stunts involved. Honestly, I didn’t think it was even possible. Being born in Sweden, I have a long relationship with this classic Swedish brand. As a young boy, I rode in the back of my dad’s Volvo. To me, Volvo represents some great Scandinavian values, like clean design, excellent quality and a true care for the environment. I’m really pleased to get this opportunity for us to work together.”
  Few machines are as versatile as the excavator. This campaign highlights the ability of Volvo excavators to deliver optimum power and performance for almost any task. While pull-ups and tire flips are not everyday activities, these stunts are entirely authentic and were carried out by professionals in a safe and closed environment. In the real world Volvo’s range of machines can be relied on for everything from site preparation, trenching and excavation to demolition, truck loading and pipe laying.

At an event at the factory, Volvo CE President Melker Jernberg thanked the 2,200 employees, business suppliers and customers for their commitment over the last two decades, and highlighted the importance of excavators to the future success of the company.
1998 AND ALL THAT
Volvo CE acquired the construction equipment business of Samsung Heavy Industries at a difficult time for the Korean economy. Shaken by the after-effects of the Asian Financial Crisis, the outlook was far from certain. But neither the company nor the workers had any reason for concern. Since the acquisition Volvo CE has surpassed its original objective to triple production – today production is four times higher, while profitability has jumped five times.
“The foundation of Volvo CE Korea 20 years ago is regarded as one of the most successful acquisitions in Volvo’s history,” said Volvo CE President Melker Jernberg. “Not only did it boost South Korea’s economic credibility at a time of global financial uncertainty, but it established Volvo CE’s position as a market leader in excavator production. Since that time, we have grown the business to unprecedented levels with innovation, technology and productivity at the heart of our operations.”
  Senior leaders gather in Changwon for the celebration.
Volvo CE now exports excavators to 120 countries worldwide from its Changwon Plant, a factory that accounts for more than half of the company’s global excavator production. As of June 2018, the plant had produced 200,000 excavators, and exports have surged 10-fold since 1998.
  SungMo (SM) Yang, Vice President of Excavator Business Platform at Volvo CE and Country Management Team Leader of Volvo CE Korea, said: “The Changwon Plant has demonstrated remarkable growth, firmly establishing itself as a stable and leading global manufacturer in an ever-changing construction equipment industry. Thanks to 20 years of innovation, an outstanding work force and continued cooperation with local suppliers, we are set to continue this growth well into the future.”"

By Press Information,9/12/2018,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2018/volvo-ce-unveils-electric-compact-wheel-loader-concept/,VOLVO CE UNVEILS ELECTRIC COMPACT WHEEL LOADER CONCEPT,"Volvo Construction Equipment demonstrated the LX02 electric compact wheel loader at the Volvo Group Innovation Summit in Berlin. The prototype machine delivers zero emissions, significantly lower noise levels, improved efficiency and reduced operational costs.","Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) unveiled its latest concept machine – known as the LX02 – to industry specialists, policymakers, the media and academics at the Volvo Group Innovation Summit on Wednesday September 12th. The electric compact wheel loader prototype delivers zero emissions, significantly lower noise levels, improved efficiency and reduced operational costs, compared to its conventional counterparts.
  The LX02 was presented at the Volvo Group’s fourth Innovation Summit – which was held in Berlin, Germany – alongside autonomous and electromobility innovations from across the Volvo Group. The event focused on infrastructure and transport in cities of the future as well as how new concepts can have a positive impact on society through increased transport efficiency, reduced environmental impact and improved traffic safety. At the summit, Volvo CE also demonstrated its EX02 fully-electric compact excavator prototype and presented the company’s electric site research project.
ELECTRIC OPERATION
The LX02 is a second-generation prototype that is part of a research project and is not commercially available. To make the machine electric, the combustion engine has been replaced with a lithium ion battery. This stores enough electric energy to operate the machine for eight hours in its most common applications, such as light infrastructure construction and landscaping. The LX02 also incorporates two dedicated electric motors, one for the drivetrain and one for the hydraulics. Decoupling the subsystems has led to higher efficiency in both the systems and the entire machine.
  “The LX02 is a revolutionary zero-emissions prototype that offers improved efficiency and lower operational costs, without compromising on machine performance,” says Ulrich Faß, Emerging Technologies Manager. “It incorporates the latest advanced chemistry battery technology. As it’s electric, no particulate matter, nitrogen oxide or carbon dioxide are released into the environment. This, together with the fact that it has extremely low noise levels, makes it ideal for use in cities and densely populated areas, as it can be used without disturbing people. This is the same for the EX02 100% electric compact excavator, therefore the machines would be ideally suited to working alongside each other.” 
  Like the LX02, the EX02 is also part of a research project and is not commercially available. The prototype machine delivers zero emissions, 10 times higher efficiency, 10 times lower noise levels and reduced total cost of ownership compared to its conventional counterparts. 
CLEANER. QUIETER. MORE EFFICIENT.
  At the summit, Volvo CE also presented its electric site research project which aims to transform the quarry and aggregates industry by reducing carbon emissions by up to 95% and total cost of ownership by up to 25%. Volvo CE and its customer Skanska Sweden are currently testing the electric site solution in a real production environment for ten weeks at Skanska’s Vikan Kross quarry, near Gothenburg, Sweden. The system incorporates prototype electric and autonomous machines including the HX02 autonomous, battery-electric load carrier, the LX01 hybrid wheel loader and the EX01 cable-connected excavator. These machines are part of a research project and are not commercially available. 
  “The electrification of construction equipment will produce cleaner, quieter and more efficient machines – this represents the future of our industry,” concludes Patrik Lundblad, Senior Vice President of Technology at Volvo CE. “We are currently in a period of exponential technology growth and are at the start of a paradigm shift. At Volvo CE we are developing technologies connected to electromobility, automation and connectivity that will benefit our customers and the environment by contributing to increased machine performance, productivity, efficiency, safety and sustainability. Our future products and services will play an important part in building a sustainable society.”"

The system, which incorporates electric and autonomous Volvo machines, will run in a real production environment for 10 weeks – delivering an anticipated 95% reduction in carbon emissions and 25% reduction in total cost of operations.","Swedish companies Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) and Skanska are turning the quarrying industry upside down in a groundbreaking study to create the world’s first ‘emission-free’ quarry. Drawing on the electromobility and automation expertise of the Volvo Group, the research project, dubbed Electric Site, aims to electrify each transport stage in a quarry – from excavation to primary crushing, and transport to secondary crushing – although a negligible amount of diesel power will still be used. The system’s efficiency, safety and environmental benefits are set to impact both customers and society at large.
  Volvo CE and Skanska began testing the Electric Site concept on 29th August at Skanska’s Vikan Kross quarry near Gothenburg in Sweden, which produces aggregates for construction purposes as well as for asphalt and cement. Production will run for 10 weeks and has been designed to achieve the same output as Skanska’s usual equipment but, crucially, with up to 95% lower carbon emissions and up to 25% lower total cost of operations.
  “This is the first time that anything like this has been attempted in the quarrying industry and, if successful, Electric Site could serve as a blueprint for transforming the efficiency, safety and environmental impact of quarries around the world,” said Gunnar Hagman, CEO of Skanska Sweden.
Overview of the Electric Site
With Electric Site, Volvo CE and Skanska are challenging traditional ways of working in the quarrying industry. The project has involved developing new concept machines, work methods and site management systems which together, form a complete site solution. New technology encompasses machine and fleet control systems and logistic solutions for electric machines in quarries.
“We have had to completely rethink the way we work and how we look upon machine efficiency – pushing the boundaries of our competence,” said Melker Jernberg, president of Volvo CE. “The total site solution we developed together with our customer Skanska is not a commercial solution for sale today and we will evaluate the outcome of the tests but we have learnt so much already, elements of which will be fed into our future product development,”
FROM ELEPHANTS TO ANTS
Three rigid haulers, for example, have been replaced by eight smaller prototype HX02 autonomous, battery-electric load carriers to transport the material from the primary mobile crusher up to the secondary static crusher.
The protoype has advanced significantly since the HX01 was first shown to customers and members of the international press at the Volvo Exploration Forum in September 2016. “The HX01 was our proof of concept,” explained Uwe Müller, chief project manager for Electric Site at Volvo CE. “Once we knew it was feasible, we updated the design requirements for the HX02 to incorporate shared technologies and components from the Volvo Group, such as electric motors, batteries and power electronics. Integrating a completely new drivetrain was crucial to take full advantage of the groundbreaking electromobility developments that are happening inside the Volvo Group. Another new feature is the addition of a vision system, which allows the machine to detect humans and obstacles in its vicinity.”

ELECTRIC UPGRADE
The primary crusher on the Skanska site is loaded by the 70t dual-powered, cable-connected EX01 excavator prototype, which had not previously been seen by customers and press. The base machine for the EX01 is a Volvo EC750 model that has been upgraded to incorporate an electric motor in addition to the diesel engine.
  “To fit the new components in the machine without increasing its size required a significant amount of repackaging work,” Müller explained. “However, in terms of the operator interface and controls, nothing has changed – it’s operated in exactly the same way as a conventional Volvo excavator. If the cable is connected, the machine will automatically start in electric mode. If it’s not, it will start in diesel mode.”
  “Because the machine will be relatively static – only moving a few meters once or twice a day as the excavator works its way through the blasted rock – it’s ideally suited as a fully electric machine on a cable. This has allowed us to make it a zero-emission excavator when it’s plugged into the grid. However, we’ve designed it with flexibility in mind, so that we have the option of using the diesel engine when it’s needed, for example, to reposition the machine or quickly move it prior to blasting,” he continued.
STRONG AND SILENT 
The piles of material on the site are organised by the LX01, Volvo CE’s prototype electric hybrid wheel loader. The machine can deliver up to a 50% improvement in fuel efficiency, as well as significant reductions in emissions and noise pollution compared to its conventional counterparts. The LX01 is a ‘series hybrid’ that incorporates a driveline that consists of electric drive motors mounted at the wheels, electric-driven hydraulics, an energy storage system, a significantly smaller diesel engine and new machine architecture, including a new design of the lifting unit. It is this combination that enables the substantial gain in fuel efficiency. The prototype – which has 98% new parts and a fundamentally new machine design – can do the work of a wheel loader that is one size larger.

  As the country continues to attract new investment and flies the flag for sustainable business development, the Dubai World Central airport will play a pivotal role in transporting a growing influx of visitors. A visionary new city will be built around the airport to provide a complete transport experience for more than 200 million expected passengers a year – more than double the number that currently fly to Dubai’s main airport hub.
  The latest cinematic offering from Volvo CE will showcase how the manufacturer is helping in this transformation by putting to work 37 Volvo articulated haulers. When complete, Volvo CE will have helped construct the world’s largest air junction in one of the fastest growing urban centers.
  Perfectly placed as a hub of international trade and transit between Europe and Asia, Dubai has grown over the last 20 years from a rural fishing town in the desert into the birthplace of the world’s arguably most impressive skyline – home to the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, and alive with more than 200 nationalities.
  In 2014, the Dubai International Airport overtook London Heathrow to become the world’s busiest airport with over 70 million annual passengers, putting increased pressure on the country’s infrastructure. But when complete, the new Dubai World Central airport is set to transport more than double those numbers every year – taking advantage of its strategic position within an eight-hour flight from two thirds of the world’s population. 
  Jacqueline Reid, Interim Global Director, External Communications, at Volvo CE, said: “This incredible construction of the world’s largest airport is a defining moment in Dubai’s history – cementing its reputation as a true global center for international trade and travel. Volvo CE is a very real part of this transformation, creating sustainable construction solutions to change the way we all live and travel in the future, and we are proud to showcase the impact of this major infrastructure project through our latest Megaproject Listing.”
