0,Why America *is* ready for electric construction equipment,"
North America is ready for electric construction equipment, contrary to perceptions in some quarters that appetite for the machines lags that in Europe.
That’s according to Stephen Roy, president of Volvo Construction Equipment, Americas, speaking to International Construction.
Roy said he was seeing pockets of demand for electric machines across the USA, and that it wasn’t just their lower carbon emissions that was generating interest but the lower levels of noise and vibration.
When asked if electrically powered machines were likely to prove less popular in the North American market than in Europe, Roy said, “There are parts of the European market that are more progressive than other parts of the European market, so it’s not even the same in Europe and I think it’s the same here.
“We have states with high population density and when you go further towards the West Coast you get a lot more focus on environmental standards and more early adopters.”
Roy said he saw the trend to electrically powered machines continuing in the compact equipment market but also moving into the mid-range. Volvo is already piloting its first larger electrified excavator, the 22t EC230 in markets including Finland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, and the machine is now making its way to North America.
“We have customers that are already ready to demo and get familiar with it and then we’ll start production for North America next year,” Roy said. “For the larger machines we see some alternative power solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen combustion engines”. The company already displayed a 30t prototype hydrogen fuel cell articulated hauler at ConExpo 2023 earlier this year.
Roy also highlighted the fact that certain customers are interested in the lower levels of noise and vibration that electric machines can offer, rather than just their sustainability credentials.
“It’s not just about emissions. A lot of our customers are really excited about low noise and no vibrations, which can lead to improved operator conditions and also improved safety. We didn’t lead with that but we are finding that it’s just as important and creates new opportunities,” he said.
And he pointed to some unusual examples of where electric machines have proved a success in North America. “We’ve sold compact machines in areas that I would never have thought we’d sell them.
“We laugh about this but the Toronto Zoo needed machines to work at the same time that the buffalos were there but the noise from diesel machines scared them away. We also have an example of a school system that wanted to do some repairs as they are expanding a facility but the work was right next to a classroom and so again the electric machine was more suitable because it was lower noise.”
Roy said that the shift Volvo anticipated taking place in the market meant that competencies among its own workforce also had to change. “We’ve had to go out and search for people that have backgrounds in software and electrical engineering. It’s definitely a new ballgame but it’s a positive in that it’s bringing people into Volvo that maybe wouldn’t have considered it before. Electric and sustainable power brings a whole new generation of people who want to be part of this transformation.”
Meanwhile, Roy, who is set tobecome president of Volvo-owned Mack Trucks next month, said that machine control technology in construction equipment “continues to get better and more sophisticated”.
He highlighted Volvo’s Dig Assist platform. “We now have a process where you can have an expert operator dig a hole for a certain application. So maybe you were putting in a culvert in a subdivision and you need to dig the hole in the same way. An expert can go out and dig it to the parameters that we need, save the file and transfer it to another excavator. And that excavator operator can now benefit from the best practice of the first, experienced operator.”
And he pointed to the growing capabilities of Volvo’s remote-controlled machines and its productivity tools.
The OEM recently handed over a remote-controlled EC250 excavator to a customer in South Dakota who works installing pipes in a water sewer.
He also noted that Volvo has the capability to retrofit non-Volvo machines and link them into Volvo’s Connected Maps feature, which allows a visual overview in real time of the position and movement of every machine, vehicle and visitor to site.

1,Develon launches new 6-tonne Stage V mini-excavators,"

Develon has launched the new DX62R-7 and DX63-7 6 tonne Stage V mini-excavators with a new shared global styling design.
The new mini-excavators are designed to offer maximum performance, optimum stability, increased versatility, enhanced operator comfort, controllability, durability, ease of maintenance and serviceability.

Both models are powered by the new D24 Stage V compliant diesel engine providing 44.3 kW (59.4 HP) of power. Develon says that despite offering an 8% increased torque of 26.5 kgm/rpm, the D24 engine still provides a 7% decrease in engine fuel consumption.


Moreover, the DX62R-7 and DX63-7 employ a Load Sensing System that operates on a new Main Control Valve. The mechanism enables a longer spool stroke, thereby enhancing controllability and work efficiency/performance in comparison to the previous models.
Both machines provide an auxiliary flow of 90 litres per minute, which improves the efficiency of work with attachments. The flow capacity can be easily monitored on the Develon Smart 8-inch touch screen in 10 increments and can be controlled using the thumbwheel located on the joystick.




The new cab on the DX62R-7 and DX63-7 features a full glass entry door to maximise operator visibility on this side of the machine from inside the cab. A rear-view camera is optional and the high luminance LED work lamps (which are standard) on the cab further enhance visibility and safety.








The mini-excavators include the latest Develon Fleet Management TMS 3.0 Cellular system installed as standard, which provides a telematics management system for the excavators, by collecting data from sensors on the machines."
2,‘Significant’ Q1 growth for Wacker Neuson Group,"But the company admitted that it does not expect to improve on these figures during the rest of the year.
The Germany-based company’s revenue climbed by almost 28% year-on-year to €667.2 million, while EBIT (earnings before interest and taxation) – aided by a one-off sale of fixed assets – more than doubled to €87.8 million.
The EBIT margin of 13.2% was also considerably higher than the 7.5% achieved in 2022.
“As anticipated in our annual guidance,we have carried the full momentum from previous quartersinto the new fiscal year andcontinued to grow significantly,” said Dr Karl Tragl, chairman of the executive board and CEO of the Wacker Neuson Group.
“At the same time, we continue to expect the first quarter to also be the strongest of 2023.” r
As in previous quarters, all three reporting regions contributed to growth in the first quarter with big increases.
In the Europe (EMEA) region, revenue rose by 22.4% €504 million compared to €411.6 million in 2022, with particularly positive growth in Germany.
On the product side, demand for excavators, wheeled loaders and telehandler increased noticeably.
The Americas region grew by 57% to €142.6 million, with a particular sharp year-on-year increase in the USA and further growth in Canada and South American markets.
Asia-Pacific region posted a lesser increase, by 7.3% to €20.6 million, driven primarily by the Australian market with products adapted to the needs of the local market and the focus on independent rental companies continuing to generate strong demand.
By contrast, the Chinese market continued to prove difficult and declined in the first quarter.
Speaking on supply chains after the group’s net working capital ratio fell from 31.9% to 30%, CFO Christian Burkhard said: “We are are still a long way from a normalisation of the situation.
“However, the continued increase in inventory levels paid off in the first quarter as we systematically exploited our growth opportunities. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that effective working capital management remains at the top of our agenda.”"
3,Back to the future at Metso as Outotec dropped from company name,"Metso merged with Outotec in the summer of 2020 and the combined business has since acquired companies including Tesab and McCloskey International.
Yesterday, the sustainable technology specialist announced operating profits of €197 million (US$217 million) for the first quarter of 2023 after a 22% year-on-year increase in sales revenue.
Metso Outotec’s Executive Team has been renamed as the Metso Leadership Team.
“After the successful integration of Metso and Outotec, we will focus on growing a strong unified Metso company and brand,” said president and CEO of Metso, Pekka Vauramo.
“We have combined two valuable companies into one strong Metso.
“Our focus is clear: we continue enabling sustainable modern life and transforming the industry with a clear strategy and strong culture, supported by a name that is short yet established and well recognised among all our stakeholders.
“Services are an extremely important part of our business, requiring a strong name.”.
The company said that Outotec continues as a product brand and carries significant value as the name of some key technologies and products.
The change of the parent company name to Metso Corporation is effective from today, but globally the change will be implemented in a phased manner."
4,7 things we learned from Caterpillar’s latest trading update,"

Last week saw Caterpillar unveil astrong performance for the first quarter of 2023, driven in large part by growth in North America.
Sales in its construction industries division increased by 10% to US$6.7 billion, while operating margin in the segment was 26.5%.
Here’s seven things we learned about Caterpillar’s performance, what it says about the wider construction industry, and where it could be heading:

Caterpillar reported better equipment availability thanks to improving supply chain conditions. But “pockets of challenge” still remain, particularly for large engines which could impact some of its larger machines.
In general, the supply chain improvements meant that Caterpillar was able to make stronger-than-expected shipments in North America, which is Caterpillar’s most constrained region as far as dealer inventory is concerned.
Caterpillar noted that there is now improved availability of its excavators. That has come about as a result not just of the lower pressure on supply chains but also because of a slowing of demand in China.
Caterpillar said it expected China’s above 10t excavator industry to remain below 2022 levels this year due to low construction activity, while its sales in China would be below the typical range of 5-10% of total Caterpillar sales in 2023.
The better availability of some types of machine in turn means that Caterpillar expects dealers to scale back their levels of inventory in the second half of the year, even though overall demand remains healthy.
The second half of 2022 saw dealers build their inventories to the tune of $1.4 billion. Talking to analysts, Caterpillar chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby said, “We are not planning for this trend to repeat [in the second half of 2023]. Instead, we expect to see dealers decrease inventories compared to the first quarter levels and end 2023 about flat relative to the end of 2022.”
Caterpillar’s overall adjusted operating profit margin for the period was 21.1% and hit 26.5% in the construction industries division. In a call with analysts, chief financial officer Andrew Bonfield explained that while Cat’s manufacturing costs did increase, they increased by less than the company anticipated.
Better-than-expected sales volumes meant factories could operate more efficiently, while freight costs were also lower. Meanwhile, the average price Caterpillar was able to charge for machines was higher than it had expected. These factors combined to boost the company’s profit margins.
But Bonfield said he did not expect the favourable effects of absorbing costs to last in the second half of the year, with margins in the remaining quarters of the year expected to be lower than the first quarter as the relationship between price and manufacturing costs normalized.
The US government has pledged to pump billions of dollars into infrastructure investments through measures such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BiL), which it is claimed involves up to $550 billion in new spending.
Umpleby confirmed that Caterpillar had started to see the positive impact of those infrastructure dollars in orders.
Speaking to analysts, he said, “The projects that don’t require a lot of permitting, things like resurfacing roads, have already started and we’re seeing the positive benefit of that.
“When customers believe there’s a pipeline of projects coming, they’re more likely typically to make that capital investment, to make a purchase of a new piece of equipment. It has started and we expect it to continue for some time.”
Caterpillar said it expected business activity in Europe, Middle East and Africa to increase in 2023 as compared to 2022. While that was down in large part to particularly strong construction demand in the Middle East, and while uncertain economic conditions remain, the company noted that European construction was “more resilient than we previously anticipated”.
When it came to mining equipment, Umpleby said he expected healthy demand, driven by the transition to new forms of energy. He noted that commodity prices remain above investment thresholds and said he expected production utilization levels to remain elevated.
He added, “We also expect the aging of the fleet and a lower level of parked trucks to support future demand for our equipment and services. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for profitable growth.”

5,New 120 tonne XCMG AT crane for Europe,"



Chinese manufacturer XCMG has a new 120 tonne capacity all terrain crane for sale in Europe.
XCMG said the 120 tonne rating is calculated at 2.5 metres radius. At 3 metres the crane lifts 80 tonnes.
The XCA120 E on its four axle carrier has a 66 metre boom in six sections. An 11.65 to 18.5 metre, offsetable bi-fold swingaway jib can be added. Putting a pair of 7.1 metre lattice extensions in between the end of the boom and the swingaway gives a maximum tip height just beyond 96 metres. Maximum working radius is given as 60 metres.
An MTU diesel engine powers both the carrier and the crane upper. It has a ZF TraXon transmission with 12 forward speeds, driving the three rearmost axles. A retarder is also standard as is all wheel steering. XCMG said it has independent suspension “similar in overall concept to that used by Grove.”
Depending on tyre choice the crane’s overall width can be kept down to 2.75 metres. Overall length is given as being just over 14.3 metres.
Including their fully retracted position, the outriggers can be set at five spread widths: 3.83, 5, 5.9, and 7 metres. Maximum total counterweight is 33 tonnes, made up from eight slabs to allow multiple configurations.
June sees the official unveiling of the XCA120 E at the JDL Expo crane, transport and aerial work platform show in Beaune, France.

7,Haulotte posts ‘historic’ revenues across the board,"France-based lift manufacturer Haulotte has reported “historic consolidated revenues” for the first quarter of 2023, amounting to €196.3 million (US$213.5 million).
The figure represents a 43% increase on the €135.8 million ($150 million) it achieved for the same period in 2022, and keeps the company on track to achieve its predicted 20% growth for 2023.
“All of the Group’s activities showed an increase compared with Q1 2022,” said Haulotte. “The sale of equipment is up by +48%, the rental business by +7% and finally the service business by +15%.”
These percentages equate to respective 2023 revenues of €172.6 million ($190.6 million), €5.8 million ($6.4 million) and €17.9 million ($19.7 million).

While the prediction takes into account a strong historic order book, the company describes the aerial platform market as “dynamic” and says that pressure on the components supply chain is continuing to ease.
Regionally, the company saw the biggest growth in North America, where the uptake of aerial platforms is continuing to rise.
“Haulotte confirmed the results seen in previous publications and posted growth of +72% in the first quarter, largely driven by the aerial work platform business, which more than doubled compared to the same period last year.”
The Latin American and Asia-Pacific regions both saw first quarter sales grow by 38% compared to the same period last year and “In Europe, sales were up by +35% in the first quarter, driven by all markets except for Russia, which is at a standstill”.

8,Engineering firm converts 1.6t excavator into disaster rescue robot,"

Forth Engineering, based in Cumbria in the UK, has built a remote-controlled ‘rescue robot’ designed to be sent into disaster zones and controlled remotely.
The machine is based around a 1.6t JCB compactor excavator platform.
It is tetherless and can be controlled from a safe location up to 150 metres away.
It carries a 700bar rescue tool, a grapple hook to move obstructions, a hopper to disperse sand to contain spillages, and an affixative spraying system to contain a nuclear spillage.
The robot has already been trialled at Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria and Forth is now looking it rolling it out to other plants across the UK.
Mark Telford, Forth’s managing director, said: “The Rescue Robot is a pioneering development which has already been successfully tested in hazardous environments, and it has been manufactured to offer a safe, remotely operated alternative to sending humans into disaster zones.
“By working with Sellafield Ltd, we were able to prove the machine is able to withstand some particularly dangerous conditions, and its various adaptations and capabilities mean that this will be a real asset to the UK’s nuclear industry.
“There are endless amounts of modifications and end effectors which can be included on the robot, and we are excited to be able to provide a product which will make working in nuclear plants across the country much safer, while also saving industry a substantial amount of money.”
“Sellafield Ltd required the development of a 1.6 tonne robot, but we are able to adapt the product to any size and also fit it with any type of tools or end effectors to fit the nature of the project.
“What is extremely exciting to us is that it can also be adapted to work in any industry, and it is a real game changer in reaching some of the most dangerous environments found in sites across the UK.”"
9,Online exclusive: Rokbak investigates electric and hydrogen-powered articulated trucks,"The idea of articulated trucks that can carry a payload of 30 tonnes being powered by electric power might seem far fetched but it is a possibility that the company Rokbak is looking into. Paul Douglas, Managing Director of the articulated truck company – which is part of the Volvo group – says that they are investigating all possibilities.

“Our trucks will have to be zero emissions somehow. The question is: what does that look like?” comments Douglas. “Electrification using battery technology that you can see today is a stretch for these big products because these are big power demand for long hours of usage.”
As Douglas says, electric power probably isn’t the best source for trucks due to how large they are and their work cycles – it isn’t uncommon for trucks to be run for 20 or 22 hours a day. “We are looking at hydrogen internal combustion engine and fuel cells to provide the electricity using hydrogen. These are technologies that Volvo is working with on their own highway truck and bus solutions.”
Douglas is originally an engineer and the challenges of cutting emissions and alternative power sources clearly excites him. He makes the point that, with technology developing at a rapid rate, no one in the construction industry can confidently state what the future will hold for power.
“It is easier to electrify the smaller stuff,” he says. “But there’s a lot of learning that comes from that. And you know, I can’t keep up with battery technology. It’s moving so quickly. Every six months battery capabilities seem to grow almost exponentially. I don’t know where it will all end up, but I think it’ll be a combination; some products will be batteries, some will be hydrogen fuel cells, and some will be hydrogen internal combustion.”
The last 18 months have been a boom time for both rigid and articulated haulers with numbers the highest they have been for around a decade at around 9,000 units a year. Part of this is due to pent up demand that followed the Covid-19 pandemic added to governments around the world investing in large infrastructure projects although Douglas believes that this is likely the peak of the market.
“We all felt at 8,000 units worldwide, that would be the peak. Then we said the same thing at 8,500, but now we are over 9,000 units. When I look around specific markets, we can see the slowdown coming, such as in Europe. I think we’re probably at the peak now. How long will that hold? Most of 2023 will probably level out [at current levels] although we could start to see a downturn in the second half of the year. It’s very strong at the moment, so we need to capitalise on that as much as we can.”
One of the markets that has driven this growth is North America, which Douglas says accounts for over half of Rokbak’s sales. In terms of smaller markets that have seen good growth he highlights Indonesia and the UK where the HS2 high-speed train project has played a key role in generating demand.
The brand of Rokbak has been around now for around 18 months following the name change from Terex Trucks. Douglas says that a huge effort went into this and that the response from the industry has been very positive. “The reception of it has been fantastic, first and foremost with our own dealer network because we were asking them to move from the old name to Rokbak. But they’ve gone with it, they’ve got a positive feel about it, they’ve invested into. The attraction that we’re getting from people that want to be on this journey with this, inquiries about becoming our dealer, has been really good.”
Talking about the dealer network, the change that we spoke about at the start of this article, from diesel powered trucks to alternative powered trucks, will impact dealers in more ways than one. First, they will be selling a different product and secondly there are different demands and opportunities with this.
“Your dealer partners, the people that sell and support the product – this is going to be a new adventure for them as well,” he says. “It’s new technology for them. An electric drive product probably gets less wear parts, less servicing and spares opportunity. That’s going be a real challenge for the traditional dealer. Their business model’s going to have to evolve.”
Equipment manufacturers have reduced emissions to meet different standards around the world and are now investing heavily into the R&D of alternative power sources, all while juggling issues such as rising inflation and a lack of skilled workers. It is a challenge, but Douglas gives off the sense that he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Moving into this new technology, new manufacturing processes are going to be required, new dealer models. There’s a real change, you can feel it in the air,” he says, pausing for breath before adding with a smile, “It’s fascinating.”"
10,APEX 2023: a guide to what’s new at Maastricht show,"Unsurprisingly, green energy and digitization will be two focuses of the world’s largest dedicated exhibition for access equipment, taking place in June this year. Manufacturers will be out in force and here follows just a few examples of those.
Dinolift will be addressing all these, alongside electrification and sustainably, by promoting its MyDino telematics software at the show that will partly be demonstrated via mobile phone and tablet.
MyDino comes standard on all units, including the 280 RXTE lightweight boom lift pictured here, introduced from January.
The Finish manufacturer is also supporting the European green target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, with its the lithium version of its 280 RXTE model, launched last year.
Also, there will be the 23m working height 230 VTH chassis mounted unit, while trailer mounts will be represented by the 160XTB II.
Faresin will attend APEX for the first time and present the 6.26 Full Electric and 17.45 Classic 55 telehandlers.
Electrification will be one of the most important themes on the Faresin stand. The 6.26 Full Electric was launched in 2018 as the first electric telehandler in the world and has since then gone on to considerable success and updated versions.
Designed to be agile, quiet and sustainable, the 6.26 has a 2.6 tonne lifting capacity and a maximum height reach of 6m.
Created as a twin to the diesel-powered version, the full electric unit is suited to construction sites at night, zero-emission residential areas, livestock farms, greenhouses and food handling areas, such as cold rooms, wine cellars and food laboratories.
The 17.45 Classic 55 of the Big Range is created for greater heights, with a three-section boom for a maximum lifting height of 17 meters and a maximum load capacity of 4.5 tonnes.
XCMG will display eight models, including electric telescopic units and an electric 18m rough terrain scissor lift, among others.
It is worth mentioning that the XG1823ERT RT scissor and XGS28ACK telescopic boom are being introduced to Europe for the first time.
The electric XG1823ERT has a maximum working height of 18m with a large rated load of 700kg. The also electric XGS28ACK has a capacity of 460kg and the maximum operating height of 28.8m.
The telescopic XGS58E1 will also be at the exhibition. The super-large 58.6m working height model with 24.8m outreach, is a newly upgraded version of the pre-existing model of the same name. It has a 230kg/450kg dual load capacity.

WHEN:6- 8 June, 2023

11,Small but mighty: The role of mini and midi excavators in modern projects,"Many manufacturers in the construction industry, certainly the larger ones, have expansive product ranges. One of the reasons for this is financial – the more products a company can sell and service the more money can be made – but another one is simple necessity; construction is such a broad industry that it requires a wide selection of equipment.
Out of all the equipment that is used in construction it is difficult to think of one that has grown in popularity quite as quickly as compact excavators such as the mini excavator (machines approximately 0-6 tonnes) and the midi (approximately 6-10 tonnes).
“The first mini excavators were produced in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a tool of necessity in the country’s famously dense and crowded cities,” explains Chris Sleight, managing director, Off-Highway Research. “By the 1980s they were being exported to Europe and North America, but it was not until the early 1990s when Japanese asset prices collapsed and the economy stagnated that these overseas markets became much more important to the sector’s (still predominantly) Japanese suppliers.”
By the late 1990s, Europe had overtaken Japan as the world’s largest mini excavator market, while demand in North America was matching that of Japan by the mid-2000s. However, it was not until around 15 years ago that the popularity of mini excavators became truly established.
“The previous peak in sales was in 2007, just prior to the impacts of the Lehman Bros. collapse and global economic crisis. That year saw just under 185,000 mini excavators sold worldwide. Fast forward to 2021, the latest peak in the mini excavator cycle, and more than 325,000 units were sold,” says Sleight.
Two key factors have driven this growth: compact excavators have increasingly replaced traditional machine types like the backhoe loader in Europe and North America thanks to the attraction of a smaller footprint, full 360-degree slewing and lower prices than backhoe loaders; they have also started to sell in significant numbers in emerging countries. The most notable has been China, where the mini excavator market peaked at more than 100,000 machines sold in 2020.
Timur Abied, utility product manager at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) tells International Construction that mini and midi excavators are among the OEMs fastest growing product segments with more efficient governance of energy being a main driver.
This sentiment is backed up by Cédric Durand, product management director EMEA, Yanmar Compact Equipment, who says that mini and midi excavators have been growing strongly over the past years.
He adds that, “From one year to another the growth can differ from one country to the other but almost all countries had a strong growth.”
Another smaller factor – but still important – behind the growth in the popularity of these machines is the increased use of attachments such as tiltrotators. “The growing popularity of tiltrotators has been a gamechanger for compact excavators, as tiltrotators allow an excavator operator to tilt and twirl an attachment 360 degrees,” says David Caldwell, national product manager, Takeuchi-US.
New technology is increasingly being integrated into mini and midi excavators, often from what was originally reserved for larger models. Stephane Dieu, excavators product manager, Europe, Develon (previously Doosan), says that, “With the arrival of our DX-7 range, all of the new mini excavators in the range are now equipped with our DoosanConnect telematics system, which was restricted in the past to only our medium and heavy segments – 14 tonne and over in the excavators. This gives our customers the opportunity to fully monitor their compact fleet.”
Chris Bardas, product manager, Hitachi Construction Machinery, reveals that the OEM’s latest mini and compact excavator are, “equipped with ICT solutions, safety features such as rear- and side-view cameras, and benefit from the Zaxis-6 cab, which is renowned for being highly comfortable and spacious, with an ergonomic seat and user-friendly controls.”
Wacker Neuson’s Klaus Allerstorfer, product manager, excavators, agrees that, increasingly, features are being added to mini and midi excavators that in the past were only for bigger models.
“Overall, more and more features are now being integrated into smaller models that were previously only used in larger models,” he explains.
“By features, I don’t just mean hardware, but also digital and data-driven solutions. One example is our EquipCare telematics solution, which makes it easier for our customers to manage their fleets and keep track of the condition of their machines.”
Electric powered equipment is a major trend in construction, especially in compact machines such as mini and midi excavators which many believe are more suited to this type of power than larger machines.
As is the case with many OEMs, Hitachi Construction Machinery has recently launched new electric models in this segment (ZX55U-6EB mini and ZX85-6EB compact) as has Takeuchi, with the all-electric TB20e.
Caterpillar, the world’s largest OEM, announced last year that its construction industries division was working on four new electric equipment machines, including the 301.9 Electric Mini Excavator powered by a Cat 48V, 32kWh battery with a run time of up to eight hours on a single charge.
Another new electric model is Bobcat’s 2-tonne mini-excavator the E19e – an electric version of the E19 internal-combustion model. It offers zero emissions, low-noise operation and comparable levels of performance to its diesel-powered counterpart.
The Bobcat E19e features the same profile and external dimensions. It features a 3.5-hour battery capacity and can be recharged quickly using a super-fast charger, meaning that, by topping up the power during work breaks, the machine can be used all day for the majority of typical applications.
Scott Park, Doosan Bobcat CEO, commented, “With the introduction of the E19e, Bobcat has expanded its larger-size electric line-up of zero emission and quiet machines that can match the excellent performance of our conventional models.”
Volvo CE has been at the centre of the development of electric powered construction equipment, with the OEM introducing its first electric compact models back in 2019 and now offering three compact electric excavators and two compact wheeled loaders. Volvo CE’s Abied says that the company are not just looking at compact equipment though, adding that, “While we started with electric mini excavators, we have also grown into the development of mid-size solutions such as our EC230 Electric excavator.”
While larger excavators may be increasingly electrified in the future, the focus is clearly on compact equipment such as mini and midi excavators.
A key point that OEMs make is that, as well as the benefits of electric power such as no emissions, no noise, no vibrations (thus a more comfortable environment for the operator), one thing is key: performance is just as good, if not better, than with diesel models.
Bardas from Hitachi sums it up by saying, “One of the main advantages of our zero-emission mini and compact excavators, the ZX55U-6EB and ZX85U-6EB, is the high level of performance they provide. No compromises have been made in terms of performance and they have been designed to provide similar levels of performance as diesel alternatives. The fact that they are zero-emission and quieter than diesel models are additional benefits.”
Despite all of the benefits that electric power brings, there are also challenges. Arguably the biggest one is the bottom line. To put it simply, electric machines are considerably more expensive than their diesel counterparts.
“When it comes to battery-powered solutions, the purchase price can be a hurdle,” admits Allerstorfer from Wacker Neuson. “But if you look at the total cost of ownership, the e-machines score with very low maintenance and operating costs, which in turn convinces many customers. In addition, we have found that renting the machines can help to quickly overcome initial doubts.”
Durand from Yanmar agrees that the higher cost is putting off some, but also makes the point that the total cost of ownership over the life of the machine can be less. “Indeed, the purchase cost is still higher than with traditional ICE machines. In the long run this price premium should decrease, and we are looking into the total cost of ownership as well which, at the end, is certainly the best criteria for profitability,” he says.
Another issue is undoubtably with charging and infrastructure. If construction is taking place on a remote site and not in a city then there may not be a power source to charge the battery. At the moment there are no universal standards regarding charging hardware and protocols.
“The lack of charging infrastructure and the still slower pace of introduction is a challenge and we need all stakeholders to help deliver the ecosystem required to support our electric machines and, in doing so, together achieve the strategic objectives of the Paris Agreement,” says Volvo CE’s Abied.
“High energy costs and the lack of financial and legal incentives also hamper deployment of strategic initiatives supporting electric power as the competitive solution for mini and midi excavators.”
When it comes to charging solutions increasing numbers of companies are producing fast charging options and there are other options, such as Wacker Neuson’s ‘charging box’.
“We are not only focusing on the development of zero emission products, but are also looking at entire construction site solutions,” says Allerstorfer.
“We will soon be launching our Charging Box, a mobile power bank for the construction site. This will enable customers to charge their zero emission products easily – and above all independently from local power sources.”
While electric mini and midi excavators are growing in popularity, the number of models sold are very small compared to diesel models. So, what’s next for these diesel models? More new technology being integrated into them that makes the life of an operator easier, and was previously reserved for larger machines, is one trend that will continue.
“These newer technological features all have one thing in common – they’re designed to help operators stay comfortable and more productive,” says Caldwell from Takeuchi US.
“They also help ensure that operators know exactly how their machines are performing by providing a great deal of information at their fingertips.”
In Wacker Neuson’s newest excavator, the wheeled EW100, Allerstorfer says that, “Digitisation played a major role in the development of this machine. For example, we have implemented an intelligent attachment management, a state-of-the-art Human-Machine-Interface, and the preparation for various assistance systems for process optimisation.”
Regarding sales around the world, mini and midi excavators are expected to continue to see strong numbers, if perhaps not at the same levels as in recent years.
Mini excavators are machines which replace manual labour. With the economic driver of rising labour costs (plus the difficulty in finding workers ) added to the fact that the purchase cost for these machines is cheaper than ever, adoption will continue.
“Drivers like these are at play in emerging markets, and the large-scale mini excavator industry which has sprung up in China means that machines are more affordable now than they were before,” says Off Highway Research’s Sleight. “This will help drive the adoption of this type of compact equipment around the world in the years to come.”
It will be interesting to see just what technology and power sources these mini and midi excavators of the future are equipped with as standard."
12,"Second 3,000 tonne capacity Huisman giant crane for Havfram","
Havfram Wind has ordered its second 3,000 tonnes-plus capacity Huisman crane for offshore wind turbine installation.
Dutch crane and heavy engineering specialist Huisman will supply the Norwegian installation contractor with the giant leg encircling crane (LEC). Installation will be on the second new NG-20000X wind turbine installation vessel. This order follows the first, placed in mid-December 2022, for an identical crane which was the 13th LEC order for Huisman since 2021.
At the same time, Havfram ordered the second new NG-20000X vessel, on which the crane will be installed, from CIMC Raffles in China. It is designed by GustoMSC in the Netherlands and CIMC Raffles. The new vessels with their 3,000 tonne LECs will be able to install turbines with rotors up to 300 metres in diameter and monopile foundations weighing 3,000 tonnes to a water depth of 70 metres.
Huisman’s fully electric LECs for Havfram will have 155 metre booms and a lifting height around 180 metres above the deck. It is designed to be lightweight and reliable, with high positioning accuracy and energy efficiency in operation. Deck space is maximised by the short tail swing design. Its segmented slew bearing is designed for easy inspection and maintenance.
Speaking about the latest order David Roodenburg, Huisman CEO, said, “We are grateful that Havfram have placed their trust in us to also equip their second innovative new build vessel with a Huisman crane. They are constructing some of the world’s most energy efficient, hybrid-powered wind turbine installation vessels. We are proud that with the two crane orders, we can contribute to boosting wind energy production as well as further improving energy efficiency to reduce Havfram’s carbon footprint.”
Commenting on his choice of crane Håkon Johannessen, Havfram Wind engineering manager, said, “We are pleased to have Huisman supplying cranes for our newbuild wind turbine installation vessels. Huisman’s track record and willingness to tailor their already proven leg encircling crane design to fit the requirements of Havfram and the market has been key to ensuring we have the right tool for the tasks that lie ahead.”
Like the first unit this second crane will be built at the Huisman factory in Zhangzhou, China.

13,IRE 2023: what equipment will be on show?,"Since the last edition of the International Rental Exhibition (IRE), it would be an understatement to say that plenty of innovation has taken place among manufacturers, driven by the demand for compact equipment, alternative power and environmentally friendly solutions.
The show will bring an array of those OEMs together under one roof to display just some of the latest launches and developments in construction equipment and technology, as well as aerial platforms through the APEX show, which is being held in conjunction with IRE.
With a wide range of equipment on show - more than 200 companies combined are exhibiting at IRE and APEX - here is a preview of what visitors can expect to see at IRE 2023.
The role of sustainability and low-emission equipment has continued to increase in recent years, and that theme will be highlighted at IRE as Sany will show the electrically driven SY19E mini excavator.
The machine, which the company says delivers zero pollutant emissions and significantly lower noise levels, comes with an electric motor that delivers a peak output of 15kW and an accumulator pack that lasts for an entire working day on one battery charge.
Charging the machine is made possible with a fast-charging station via DC in 1.5 hours, at a public AC charging station in 2.5 hours or overnight at a 220V socket.
Case Construction will highlight its CX15 EV 1.3 tonne mini excavator. Powered by a 16kW electric motor, the machine features retractable tracks that reduces machine width to 790mm and a load-sensing hydraulic system that is said to allow the operator to dial the machine into each task.
The 21.5kWh lithium-ion battery is charged either by the 110V/220V on-board charger or via an external rapid charger that can fully charge the machine in 90 minutes and can last up to an entire working day depending on the work, while its minimum swing radius design is said to make working close to structures and obstacles easier.
From its range of electric and low-emission machines, Yanmar will display several future-ready machines at IRE.
First up is the SV17e electric mini excavator prototype. Designed for the 1.5 to 2.0 tonnes segment, the unit is powered by an all-electric drive and has an open-centre hydraulic system with load-sensing hydraulic pump.
The SV17e delivers 23.5kWh gross electric power, while its 48V air-cooled motors provides “impressive digging, lifting and carrying capabilities,” according to Yanmar.
Another Yanmar prototype on show will be the V8e electric compact wheel loader with 40kWh battery capacity, hydrostatic drive and high-lifting capabilities.
The machine has an 800l loading bucket, 11kW charging in standard configuration and 22kW in optional fast charging.
Joining the SV17e and V8e is the C08e tracked carrier and ViO33 zero tail swing excavator.
With an 11.5kWh battery and a power capacity of 24V, Yanmar says the compact C08e has the “ultimate power and manoeuvrability to excel in tight spaces,” while the ViO33 is said to offer “true zero tail swing” and an “ultra-quiet and efficient engine” designed with low emissions in mind.
Launched in 2020, the eDingo 500 electric compact utility loader from Toro will make its European tradeshow debut at IRE having undergone several upgrades over the last three year’s.
An electric version of the Dingo 323, the machine produces zero engine-exhaust emissions and less noise thanks to its HyperCell Power System, a new lithium-ion battery system developed by Toro.
Part of the Tobrocco Giant stand will be formed of the latest additions to its e-range of compact wheel loaders.
The G2200E, an electric version of the G2700, and the G2200E X-TRA are both equipped with a 48V LPT-battery that can be charged at a car loading station. An external high frequency charger with 48V/150A of 48V/300 can also be used to charge the machine.
Said to be ideal for rental due to the low service weight, the wheel loaders have a pulling force of 12.500N.
In addition to the compact loaders, Tobrocco says it will also introduce the GP1950E electric vibratory plate and the GR740E vibratory rammer.
JCB will show its latest innovations in zero-emissions technology and demonstrate its role in the move towards a cleaner, low-emission future for construction and rental equipment with its growing range of JCB E-TECH electric machinery.
The JCB 19C-1E - the world’s first electric mini excavator will take centre stage, the company say.
The machine is said to produce zero exhaust emissions at point of use and is “considerably quieter” than a standard machine.
Four lithium-ion batteries provide 20kWh of energy storage – enough for full working shift for many mini excavator customers on a single charge.
Also new will be a 2 tonne capacity E2000 electric site dumper from HG Machines in Denmark. This machine follows on from the ultra-compact 1 tonne capacity machines launched by the company in 2016. See more on this machinehere.
The newly launched Archy rental platform from Gorman-Rupp Europe will be officially launched into the international market at IRE.
The platform aims to deliver “faster, easier and more reliable” pump rental by using a 10-step pump selector that can advise which pump is needed for specific projects.
It then suggests which pump will be ideal for the user and details how to reserve, rent and manage the pumps as well as all the rental pricing.
Gorman-Rupp say 100s of pumps will be available on the tool, including booster pumps, centrifugal pumps, diaphragm pumps, high pressure centrifugal pumps, pump hoses and submersible pumps.
Another new launch on show at IRE will be the Task Manager web application from Volvo CE. The worksite management tool, which is currently available in the North American market, is designed to connect people, machines and projects to ensure activities are delivered “on target, on time and to budget,” according to Volvo CE.
Swepac will show a line-up of reversible plates it is launching as part of its Battery One concept range.
The FB200B has a 4.6kWh onboard battery, 3.0kW IPM synchronous motor, 550mm wide base plate, while the larger FB300B has a 6.6kWh onboard battery, 10.0kW IPM synchronous motor and 600mm wide base plate.
The large onboard batteries enable them to reach sufficient running time without re-charging.
Users can monitor the progress of projects, set targets, track material on sites and manage data from mixed fleets in real-time. The data collected by Task Manager is then made accessible via mobile or laptop.
Spartan Solutions will debut its PHALANX V6 software platform that aims to streamline the process of equipment rental operations.
The platform utilises artificial intelligence (AI), expert rules and statistical algorithms to identify patterns and trends in equipment’s telematics and operations data. This data includes information about the performance, operation, maintenance, and usage of a machine.
Once the data is collected, the AI engine can detect any abnormalities or issues.
Launched at Bauma 2022, the HBOX+ Hybrid lighting tower will be presented by Himoinsa.
The tower combines a battery-powered system and Stage V diesel engine that is said to reduce noise and carbon footprint while keeping the 120,000-lumen light capacity of its diesel counterpart.
The HBOX+ Hybrid includes LFP batteries (Lithium Phosphate) that have been designed for a lifetime of 6000 cycles, while also offering four different working modes.
The HBOX+ Hybrid incorporates 4 x 350W LED spotlights and an LED Dimming Control which means the tower can start-up with dimming.
Himoinsa will also demonstrate the 45/60 model (60kW/h) of its EHR battery-powered generator which comes with its HICORE System.
Described as a compact, clean product, the generator can operate as a single source of power generation for as a recharging station for electrical construction machinery, as well as allowing integration with gas and diesel generator sets.
Vistors to the Briggs & Stratton stand will be able to see its newest Vanguard battery products and engine solutions.
The products on display include the Vanguard Si 1.5kWh Swappable Battery and the new Vanguard 400 EFI /ETC Single Cylinder (pictured).
The company says it developed the cylinder by working with OEMs to provide a “tailored power solution, that caters to each OEM’s specific requirements within the rental market.”
Generac Mobile will display the VT-Solar, a generator-free lighting tower with three solar panels that can recharge its built-in battery pack.
The tower is available in two versions, a manual-mast and hydraulic-mast version, which comes with higher battery capacity, powerful solar panels (400W each) and four LED floodlights with adjustable light power.
Exhibiting alongside Generac Mobile, Pramac will display its GRW Hybrid generator, which it describes as an efficient, reliable unit that reduces operational expenditure, with a choice of available operating modes that allow the correct selection according to site specifications.
Trime will present the X-SOLAR 4x60W LED lighting tower fitted with four 60W LED lamps.
The company says it is built to be robust, with galvanised metal works, and powder coating finish.
The zero-emission tower also has optional features, including a telemetry system for remote location and operational monitoring, an automatic start-up PIR operation, and dimmable lighting.
Elsehwere, ItalTower will exhibit its Street Solar lighting tower that it launched last year.
The tower with a 60W solar panel produces 6,000 lumens and has a lithium battery pack with a capacity of 14.8V.
Paclite will display its concept edging trowel, the M600.
Powered by a Vanguard engine, the new concept 600mm machine has been developed together with Cramo Sweden and is said to be ideal for rental due to its ABS fly wheel, which ensures concrete does not stick to the trowel.
Paclite says it will launch new versions of the M900 and M600 later this year, powered by a long-lasting battery-charger & motor.
Taking place from 6-8 June, IRE will be held at the MECC centre in Maastricht, the Netherlands, alongside APEX, the European Rental Association’s (ERA) annual Convention and the European Rental Awards.

14,Why Develon and Hyundai CE believe compact equipment can take them into top 5 OEMs,"
It’s a tall order to break into the top 5 construction equipment OEMs.

In fact, it would take sales of around US$11 billion, according to last year’s Yellow Table,International Construction’sranking of the top manufacturers by revenue.

Nonetheless, that’s the goal of Hyundai Genuine, the holding company ofHyundai Construction Equipment (Hyundai CE)and what used to be Doosan Infracore and is nowDevelon.

Talking toInternational Constructionat ConExpo 2023, Seunghyun Oh, CEO of Develon and Albert (Seunghyun) Roh, product director for Develon in Europe explain the thinking behind their ambitious targets.

Hyundai Genuine has a balancing act to perform; its Develon and Hyundai CE brands need to look and feel sufficiently different from each other but also make use of shared resources.
One of the ways that the resources of the two companies is being leveraged is though research and development (R&D).
They are working together, where appropriate, to develop new technologies and to save on costs. It is one way that Hyundai Genuine can increase its global sales and push closer to the world’s biggest OEMs.
“We essentially reorganised the R&D engineers, the research engineers, let them move into Hyundai Genuine where they are going to develop a base technology for autonomy and electrification,” explains Roh.
“The two companies are separate but Hyundai Genuine, the holding company, leads on some of the advanced technology and the two sister companies are developing our existing products. We need to differentiate each product for each brand. But internally we are trying to get some synergy, particularly in R&D, procurement, and even in production.”
But the two executives also clearly believe that there are opportunities in markets and product segments that haven’t been attacked aggressively before.
“We are targeting the global top five in the whole construction equipment industry. If I look into our current business performance product-wise, in excavators – such as crawler, wheeled and heavy excavator – we are seeing quite good results,” says Roh.
“However, when it comes to compact equipment, due to the history with Bobcat and Doosan, we haven’t invested as much as we could in the compact business. From now on we are trying to invest more in the compact business to get more volume.
“At the same time, we are also seeking some opportunity in the wheel-based product, such as wheel loader or articulated dump trucks.”
The company has recently added bulldozers to its product line up, something which the dealers are said to be very happy about.
That’s the product side explained – what about different markets?
“We are trying to invest more in the advanced market to become a real global top player,” says Roh.
The CEO, Oh, adds, “We need to invest more in the North American market because the current presence is very low in terms of market share.”
When it comes to R&D the two main areas of focus are electrification and automation. Develon has already produced a two-tonne electric excavator and has plans to produce other models in this range – in our conversation they say that electrification is, “truly a mega trend for the future,” and that the company will, “develop quickly all lines of electric mini excavators.” There are also initial plans to produce a larger electric excavator of up to 20 tonnes.
But the plans for new technology are larger and more ambitious thanjustautonomy and electrification; the company wants to help the whole of the construction site to be managed more efficiently, to be a solutions provider. XiteCloud, which was first announced in 2020, is now taking its first steps towards commercialisation and is part of the company’s Concept-X.
Concept-X is an integrated unmanned and automated control solution, first demonstrated to the world in 2019.
This has developed into Concept-X2 which combines ICT (Information and Communications Technology) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies at the construction site. There will come a time – perhaps in the near future – where this isn’t a concept anymore.
“At the moment we are willing to develop continuously and upgrade the Concept-X. Now we have a version one and version two; maybe in three years, we can develop more realistic products for Concept- X.
“I am saying not only Concept-X; we will say product X. We will move to some real product not at the concept stage, that’s the plan.”
As well as the development of Concept-X into a something that is commercially available, Oh says that in the next few years the company may develop not just new compact equipment but also even bigger equipment, such as at the top end of the size and weight scale when it comes to excavators and dump trucks.
If the company doesn’t make their global top five ambitions, then it certainly won’t be for lack of effort.


It was at the Las Vegas show that the Develon brand (formerly Doosan) officially unveiled its new products.
“We had many ideas regarding the new brand name. But we selected Develon; it is the combination of two words: develop and onwards. We will continuously develop a better product for customers and develop better solutions for smart construction,” comments Oh.
Every machine that is produced from ConExpo onwards will be under the Develon name and branding. However, they revealed that for equipment that has been produced in 2023 but before the event the company will, “support some rebranding for the existing machine at the dealers yard” but that the policy differs from country to country."
15,All terrain crane donated by Tadano in aftermath of earthquake,"


Crane manufacturer Tadano has donated an all terrain wheeled mobile crane to help with reconstruction work following the devastating Turkey-Syria earthquake.
On 6 February 2023, the enormous earthquake hit near the border between southern Turkey and Syria. More than 50,000 people were killed.
“We would like to express our heartfelt sympathy to those affected by the disaster and our appreciation to all those who are working hard for recovery and reconstruction,” the company said.
Tadano donated a 50 tonne capacity ATF 50G-3 all terrain crane with 40 metre lifting height to the Turkish government. It will be used to help in the ongoing recovery and reconstruction efforts in the affected areas. The three axle model will be delivered via Istanbul-based Tadano distributor ENKA Pazarlama Ihracat Ithalat.
The ATF 50G-3 is designed to cope with the rough roads expected in the disaster-stricken area. It is a small and manoeuvrable crane, Tadano said, and “we believe that this crane will make a wide contribution to the ongoing restoration and reconstruction of the affected areas.”
Delivery of the crane to Turkey is scheduled on or around 24 April 2023.

16,Tenfold production increase for LGMG Europe,"LGMG Europe has officially opened its new production facility in the Netherlands, marking the occasion with an opening ceremony that was attended by both its business partners and customers.
Said to be 10 times bigger than the company’s previous site in Spijkenisse, the new plant will allow the company to increase the speed and efficiency of its manufacturing processes.
Guests attending the opening event were treated to a tour of the new facility, which LGMG Europe has spent the past five months renovating. The site includes offices, a state-of-the-art training centre and a full spare parts warehouse.
LGMG, which is due to introduce 10 new equipment models to its product portfolio later this year, said a new ERP (enterprise resources planning) system had also been implemented. This will enable the company to increase the availability of finished products and spare parts, and provide a faster response times and services.
The opening ceremony was co-hosted by LGMG Sales Director of Europe, Vincent Vercaemst and Ares Song, General Manager of LGMG MEWPS, who just a few weeks ago revealed that the subsidiary’s sister company, LGMG Mexico, would begin producing boom and scissor lifts in the second half of this year following the opening of its new US$140 million facility in Monterrey.
The Mexico plant and an overall restructuring of its operations in the US are in response to theU.S. Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission’s rulings in late 2021that imposed high import tariffs on LGMG’s products entering the US market.

17,Digging with a twist: What are the advantages of a tiltrotator?,"Popular in Scandinavia, and growing in other areas of Europe, the tiltrotator is deemed to significantly increase machine efficiency.
The tiltrotator can look like a confusing bit of kit but it is possible to think of it as a wrist that directly connects to the excavator’s arm or beneath the excavator’s quick hitch. The tiltrotator is then connected to the excavator’s hydraulics and electrical system. Depending on the excavator’s extra hydraulics, control is adapted to suit different types of control system.
In the early 1980s, the Norgrens family introduced the Tiltrotator to the Swedish market under their family-owned and operated company Noreco, and since then it has become a standard in the Scandinavian region. The concept has also recently gained popularity in many other countries across the globe, including the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the United States.
Sven-Roger Ekström, senior product manager at Rototilt, understands the capabilities of tiltrotators better than most and believes that they have several benefits that could change the way we work on construction sites.
Upon asking Ekström why everyone should have a tiltrotator, he reels off a list of what he believes are the key advantages. “Your excavator becomes an efficient tool carrier in addition to working faster and more flexibly with fewer machine movements.”
Ekström adds that such qualities allow companies to take on new types of jobs and will require less manual labour around the machine.
Unfortunately, the skills shortage is as much a concern as it was in 2022 and including a new attachment into the field can cause apprehension for potential buyers, who may be uncertain about imposing such a complex attachment on operators.
Ekström, however, says it takes only a short time to become proficient with a tiltrotator. “If you are a skilled excavator operator you will need 1-2 weeks to perform really well. After that first jumpstart, you will start to see new opportunities such as how to solve working tasks in a new way and become even more efficient.”
Stefan Stockhaus, CEO of Steelwrist, believes that tiltrotators are also the answer to increasing safety in potentially dangerous working conditions. By using tiltrotators, jobs traditionally done outside the cabin can be moved into the cabin, removing ground workers from risk-prone roles. “It’s not all about efficiency,” he says. “It’s also about safety and becomes an alternative to a standard factor.”
Increasing efficiency is undoubtedly a huge advantage on the modern-day construction site and Ekström says tiltrotators can increase efficiency by 25% to 30% depending on the type of job. “On some jobs where you, with the combination excavator plus tiltrotator, can do the same job as two or three standard excavators you of course calculate with even higher figures,” he adds.
Steelwrist’s Stockhaus agrees with Rototilt’s Ekström regarding his sentiments on the tiltrotators ability to increase efficiency, but he adds that enjoyment is also a benefit. “In our case, 96% of all the experienced users say that the job is more fun. And if the job is more fun, it’s easier to attract good employees. Those are two really strong cases. As I see it anyway – efficiency, profitability, but also more fun.”
Mature markets, such as Scandinavia, have embraced the adoption of tiltrotators. Almost 90% of excavators in the region have the attachment, which is said to be crucial to winning projects as well as meeting specific sustainability goals.
While Scandinavia has fully adopted this form of attachment, the rest of Europe is somewhat slower. “It always take time to break new ground and to change old habits,” says Ekström.
“In Scandinavia, we have a long practice of getting more efficient because of expensive, and the lack of manual labour. We also have a market with many small contractors that often see the owner in the cab working with the equipment; therefore, he can quickly see the benefit of working in a new way.”
Stockhaus believes the popularity surrounding tiltrotators in Scandinavia comes from the region’s pressure on increased productivity – it is also the key to getting jobs.
Elsewhere in Europe, Ekström says that big companies with a large rental market often take longer to see the benefits. Other obstacles, he says, can be that as long as the contractors are satisfied with buying two or three machines instead of one machine with a tiltrotator, the dealers will not push the product until the customer asks for it.
Autumn 2022 saw Rototilt launch its Rototilt Control product concept featuring tiltrotators, joysticks, a new control system and a remote support app. The product has become well established in the market and companies are starting to realise their potential – Rototilt are now expanding the number of tiltrotators in their RC series.
The company confirmed that Rototilt’s R4 and R8 tiltrotators will gain counterparts in the RC series launched at Bauma last year. This means that Rototilt’s new RC System control system and the new RC Joysticks will be available to machines weighing between 10 and 43 tonnes.
The R4 tiltrotator has historically been one of Rototilt’s most popular products, according to Ekström, who has high expectations ahead of the sales launch.
He says, “We started in the mid-range but are now expanding the concept to encompass both bigger and small machines. Today we are delighted to offer increased energy efficiency and an improved driving experience for a wider range of machines and users.”
The new tiltrotator series, due to launch in February 2023, features pressure-compensated hydraulics and is said to deliver greater energy efficiency than its predecessors, in addition to enabling more controlled excavation movements.
As part of a joint initiative, Steelwrist and Rototilt have come together to set an industry standard for fully automated quick couplers under the Open-S Alliance. The non-profit organisation sets out to develop and promote the Open-S standard, with the ultimate aim of achieving global interchangeability between quick couplers, tiltrotators and work tools for excavators.
The alliance’s standardisation work has been ongoing for the last two years with the purpose to increase safety and efficiency for excavator owners, operators and ground personnel.
The partnership has started to create a uniform manufacturing standard for dimensions and tolerances as well as making it cost efficient to retrofit adaptor brackets to used and new buckets and work tools.
In 2021, Volvo Construction Equipment became the first excavator specialist to join the alliance in hopes to work with other industry partners on improving work tools for excavators. The demand for fully automatic quick couplers on excavators has continued to grow rapidly in general construction and it is said that all partners are seeing opportunities for growth in a variety of sectors.
Steelwrist and Rototilt are paving the way for the future of tiltrotators, in addition to the likes of Volvo Construction Equipment and Caterpillar. Scandinavia needs no convincing evidence of the advantages of tiltrotators and it seems the rest of Europe is taking a particular interest in increasing efficiency.
Last year, Caterpillar Work Tools Division announced new Tilt Rotate System (TRS) models for Cat 302.7 through 310 Next Generation Mini Excavators.
The new TRS4 and TRS8 S45 plus updated TRS6 models allow attached work tools to rotate 360 degrees and tilt 40 degrees side-to-side. This enables the machine to reach more work areas from a single position, while manoeuvring tools over, under, and around obstructions when excavating, grading ditches, sorting recycled materials, or placing pipe.
The new TRS models are said to multiply the mini excavator’s versatility and are available in various configurations to match the application.
The TRS6 and TRS8 feature a standard TRSAux2 auxiliary port at the bottom to connect a variety for different hydraulic tools whilst the compact design of the TRS4, TRS6 and TRS8 allows the mini excavator to maintain high digging forces.
TRS4 models are designed for efficient use by the 302.7, 303, 303.5 and 304 Mini Excavators, while the TRS6 models are compatible with the 305.5CR and 306 CR models. The TRS8 models are designed for use with the 307.5, 308, 308.5, 309 and 310.
Engcon is seeing “stable profitability” after reporting record-high net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022.
While the last three months of 2022 saw the company’s order intake decline by 29% SEK553 million (€49.4 million), its net sales increased to SEK541 million (€48.3 million).
This is up 46% on the SEK370 million (€33 million) the company brought in for the same period in 2021 - with operating profits also up 57% on the previous year to SEK 121 million (€10.8 million).
Overall, this resulted in a fourth quarter profit rise of 20%, to SEK 90 million ($8.6 million), up from SEK75 million (€6.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Engcon’s fourth quarter results meant that for the whole of 2022 the company saw an order intake rise of 1%, up from SEK1.96 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.97 billion (€171.4 million).
2022 net sales also increased by 30%, from SEK1.48 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.93 billion ($186 million), with profits last year amounting to SEK325 million (€29.6 million) - a rise of 21%.
Krister Blomgren, Engcon’s CEO, said, “Combined with increased economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rates, this led to an expected downturn in Nordic and European markets in the fourth quarter compared with exceptional comparative figures. Despite this, the order intake was at a high level when seen from a long-term perspective.
“It is worth noting that there was a break in the trend in 2022, with growth markets recording higher order intake than the Nordic region for the first time.”
Looking to the future, Engcon plans to continue investing in its third generation tiltrotator system and expand its sales network.

18,Cummins dives into worksite dewatering,"Cummins is getting its feet wet in a new segment of the pump market with the launch of two Cummins-branded dewatering pump models targeted to construction, oil & gas, agricultural, mining, water and wastewater applications. The QSF4X4 and QSF6X6 – displayed for the first time at recent industry trade shows, including ConExpo-Con/Agg – are being offered fully finished for use in their respective operations and powered by the Cummins QSF2.8 Tier 4 Final engine.
The pumps are a project that has been in the works for years, according to Greg Totin, director of industrial sales, Cummins Sales & Service – Western U.S., and the culmination of many hours of customer research.
“We felt we could bring value to the market and worked to identify how best to do that,” he explained. “The pumps are powered by our 2.8 engines, and we worked with a trusted supplier to integrate them into the pumps at their facility in the U.S.”
The QSF4X4 supports flow rates up to 1350 gpm and heads up to 135 ft., while the QSF6X6 is designed for moderate flow rates up to 2600 gpm and heads up to 150 ft. Both are self-priming and re-prime automatically.
The 2.8 L QSF2.8 engine is no stranger to pump applications, having been used for some time in other pump brands used for jobsite dewatering tasks.
“The torque on the QSF2.8 makes it ideal for use in pumps,” Totin said. “Cummins also has a superb service network in North America, and that makes our engines an especially great choice for the construction/pump market.”
The engine has a compact envelope and is available rated 74 hp for industrial applications. A sculptured cast iron block ensures durability with a low weight of 507 lbs.
High-pressure common rail fuel injection, a wastegated turbocharger and full-authority electronic control technology enable the engine to provide peak torque of 221 lb.-ft. with near-zero emissions. A diesel oxidation catalyst is used to meet Tier 4 Final emissions regulations, with no diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) required.
It was important that the QSF4X4 and QSF6X6 be able to meet customers’ expectations for performance in demanding jobsite environments. “Product reliability and uptime are very important to them, so we have developed a robust package that is backed by Cummins’ strong support network,” Totin said.
The gear-driven pumps are directly coupled to the engine flywheel and are controlled via a control panel that was also packaged by the pump supplier. “The control panel is pre-programmed with Cummins fault codes for ease of service from remote locations,” Totin said, adding that the pumps are compatible with Cummins’ telematics service to further maximize availability and efficiency and minimize downtime.
The new models feature heavy-duty cast iron construction and are available in open and sound-attenuated packages. Large fuel tanks allow for extended runtimes.
“We know that these pumps may need to go extended time periods without supervision, so they have a large fuel tank (100 gal.) and can go up to 48 hours without refueling,” Totin said. “Another factor that we know is important is rust buildup prevention. There are two 3-in., large, accessible ports to make clean-out easy.”
For ease of transport, the pumps come mounted on a fully towable trailer equipped with a standard reinforced step and safety handle, LED work lights and beacon warning light.
The QSF4X4 and QSF6X6 are now available throughout North America. “We plan to carry inventory, so we will typically have pumps available and able to ship quickly,” Totin stated.
The pumps will be supported through the company’s distributor network. Cummins warrants and services all unit components."
