30 May 2023,World’s top ten construction OEMs revealed,"The latest Yellow Table, International Construction’s annual ranking of the world’s top 50 construction equipment manufacturers by sales figures, has revealed that sales for 2022 were US$230.6 billion, one of the highest figures ever recorded in the listing.
A large reason for this growth is the performance of manufacturers based in the US. OEMs based in the US accounted for over 26% of the total revenue of the Yellow Table, up from 21% in the last listing.
You can view the full Yellow Table in the latest issue of International Construction magazine with in-depth analysis.
The top ten biggest construction equipment manufacturers in the world for 2022 were:
10. JCB, UK
JCB enters the top ten for the first time in several years, with strong sales in the OEMs main market of India boosting its bottom line. The OEM is investing heavily into hydrogen technology.
9. Sandvik, Sweden
Another rise up the table for Sandvik – the company was at number ten last year. The company has been making numerous acquisitions, with the OEM making ten acquisitions in 2022, helping to explain their increased ranking.
8. Hitachi, Japan
Hitachi had construction equipment sales of US$9.2 billion, a steady increase from its final results last year. In 2022 the brand saw the ending of its joint venture with John Deere, with Hitachi Chairman Sonny Ishii saying at ConExpo that, “The Americas market is the single most important market, or priority, for Hitachi Construction Machinery.”
7. Liebherr, Germany
Liebherr saw good growth in 2022. In its own report it said that its construction and mining segments – earthmoving, material handling technology, deep foundation machines, mobile and crawler cranes, tower cranes, concrete technology and mining equipment – had an average increase in turnover of 6.9%. Liebherr says it is taking a technology-neutral approach to its research, which includes the increased use of hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVO), for potential use in construction equipment.
6.Volvo Construction Equipment
When adjusted for currency changes, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) had sales of US$9.9 billion keeping it in sixth place. The company is one of the leading OEMs when it comes to electric construction equipment, with one of the largest commercially available ranges including its new 23 ton battery electric excavator.
5. Sany, China
China-based Sany drop down one place in the table, from number four to number five. The Chinese construction market faced challenges in 2022 following on from two strong years so a general drop in China-based OEMs on the table was expected.
4. John Deere, US
US-based John Deere increased its ranking on the Yellow Table by one place, as it did in the previous Table. The company’s purchase of the Wirtgen Group has been a success and provided the company with access to new markets.
3. XCMG, China
Despite seeing sales fall, XCMG remains the world’s third largest OEM. As is the case with all major Chinese OEMs, the company is actively looking to increase its share of the international market and its most recent results showed record overseas sales. One of their leading executives believes that there is more growth to come in these markets.
2. Komatsu, Japan
Komatsu remains at number two on the list and has extended the gap between it and the rest of the table with sales that, when adjusted for currency, were similar to the last Yellow Table. The OEM recently announced the development of a medium-sized hydraulic excavator concept, powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The manufacturer said the machine’s development is in line with its aim to achieve carbon neutrality in construction equipment.
1. Caterpillar, US
Caterpillar retains its traditional position as the world’s biggest construction manufacturer with sales with sales of US$37.5 billion – approximately 16% of the total of the whole table. A senior executive at the OEM recently told International Construction about the OEMs plans regarding sustainability and new technology.

26 May 2023,Heavy wheeled loaders: The workhorse of the construction site,"Heavy wheeled loaders have a home in almost every construction site and operators are spoilt for choice with the innovative machines manufacturers are releasing.
Komatsu Europe displayed the new WA800-8 wheeled loader at the demo ground at Bauma Munich in October 2022. The loader is said to have been designed for maximum operating comfort in addition to featuring a modulation clutch, variable traction control, an auto kick down and an RPM set.
The Japan-based company has also redesigned the machine’s extra-large 11.5m³ bucket, complete with its optimised maximum fill feature.
With a total operating weight of 115 tonnes, the WA800-8 meets the latest EU stage V emission regulations with a Komatsu-designed, developed and manufactured engine and after-treatment system.
“Our WA800 has always been well-appreciated for its reliability and productivity”, says Jo Monsieur, group manager for large machines at Komatsu Europe.
“And this latest generation surely continues this legacy. Furthermore, Komatsu has really set new standards for stability, comfort and safety and we are very proud to be able to offer this to our customers.”
Liebherr’s XPower wheeled loaders have established themselves at the forefront of fuel efficiency and robustness.
Liebherr says one reason is their power-split travel drive, installed as standard in all Liebherr XPower wheeled loaders. The combination of hydrostatic drive – advantageous for material uptake and travelling over short distances – and mechanical drive ensure that the machine works at maximum efficiency.
In addition to the two drive types, Liebherr offers a range of intelligent assistance systems for its mid-size and XPower wheeled loaders, including active personnel detection with brake assistance. The optional assistance system warns the machine operator of hazards in the rear area of the machine. Sensors and artificial intelligence combine to distinguish between people and objects for additional safety. As soon as the sensors detect a source of danger, the brake assistant automatically decelerates the wheel loader‘s speed. This shortens the stopping distance by multiple feet, reducing the frequency and intensity of potential accidents.
In Denmark, 40 Liebherr XPower wheel loaders are being used for material handling at RGS Nordic – which specialises in recycling construction and demolition waste materials.
Michael Jørgensen, strategic purchasing manager, commented, “The Liebherr wheel loaders need less fuel, are powerful and have hardly any downtime. We are particularly impressed that we achieve 30% more productivity with the same fuel consumption than with comparable wheel loaders in this size class.”
RGS Nordic was in the market for efficient wheel loaders with power-split drive to reduce CO2 emissions. With the company’s main focus on converting construction waste into reusable and circular products that can be integrated into the product cycle, it was important for the machinery used to reflect the same values.
Develon, formerly known as Doosan Construction Equipment, now offers the company’s latest generation ‘DL-7’ wheel loader range driven by new Stage V compliant engines and providing higher productivity, increased fuel efficiency and a low cost of ownership, coupled with a new cab offering an enhanced experience for the operator.
The four biggest standard models in the DL-7 range are the DL420-7, DL480-7, DL550-7 and DL580-7. The machines feature redesigned buckets offering up to 7% more capacity with maximum bucket capacities from 4.5 to 6.4 m3. Develon says that this provides increased productivity for a wide range of material-handling applications.
In addition to the company’s wheel loader range, Develon has introduced the ‘world’s first “transparent bucket” system’ for wheel loaders. The system is said to enable the wheel loader driver to see the blind spots in front of the machine’s bucket, using a monitor installed in the cab. By recording images with top and bottom front-loaded cameras and projecting the combined images in real-time using a curved projection method, the transparent bucket system provides a full view for the driver.
Develon says that the transparent bucket system addresses the issue of safety concerns caused by blind spots in front of wheel loaders due to their buckets. With this new feature, drivers can now easily check blind spots in front of the bucket via the cab monitor, increasing safety and reducing accidents.
Moreover, the transparent bucket system is said to enhance work efficiency by providing a forward view for the driver during loading, unloading, or carrying materials like aggregates, sand, and soil.
The company has applied for patents in Korea, North America, Europe, and China, making it the first company to develop and implement a front projection function with a transparent bucket for construction machinery.
A Develon spokesperson stated that advanced safety systems have become crucial in equipment selection with increasing safety standards. The company plans to continue developing safety features that prioritise driver and worker safety, aiming to lead the industry towards safer and accident-free construction sites.
Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has taken a major step forward in advancing its electromobility offerings with a new solution.
The company has converted its L120 wheel loader into an electric version, catering to the increasing demand for sustainable solutions in the mid-size range. The conversion was done in collaboration with partners Parker Hannifin and CE Engineering Solutions, a Volvo Group subsidiary.
The L120H Electric Conversion, available to selected customers in Europe from 2023, will provide the same performance as the conventional machine while emitting zero emissions.
Volvo CE says that it is committed to achieving a carbon-neutral construction industry and has partnered with CE Engineering Solutions and other electromobility partners to accelerate the availability of commercialised electric solutions across all segments and applications. This collaboration is part of the company’s efforts to expand its line of electric wheel loaders, following its investment in Dutch manufacturer Limach in June to broaden its electric excavator portfolio.
The L120H Electric Conversion is expected to provide numerous benefits to the construction industry, including reduced noise pollution, lower operating costs, and increased productivity. The machine’s electric powertrain also offers instant torque, making it more responsive and efficient than traditional combustion engines.
In addition, the electric version is designed to require less maintenance than its diesel counterpart, reducing downtime and increasing overall equipment availability.
Powered by 240 kWh batteries, the L120H provides a runtime of approximately five hours in most medium-duty applications. Consistent with Volvo’s existing charging solutions, it is estimated to charge from 0-100% in just 1.5-2 hours.
Carl Slotte, head of sales region Europe at Volvo CE, says, “There is no time to wait – we need to deliver solutions that allow our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Change starts here.
“Our commitment to partnership allows us to take a leading position in transforming our industry, with electric solutions that are built to fulfil market demand and tailored to suit the changing needs of our customers. Working together, we are scaling up our portfolio of electric machines, extending the versatility of our range and transforming our industry towards a carbon-neutral future.”
Depending on market demand, Volvo CE says there could be the possibility to convert existing users’ L120H wheel loaders to electric in the future.
Beyond sustainability, Volvo CE is significantly developing the safety systems that are available on their wheeled loaders.
Volvo CE has launched its Collision Mitigation System for Volvo Wheel Loaders, which aims to support operator response and reduce the risk of collision when working in reverse. The feature automatically applies the service brakes when the wheel loader approaches an obstacle, helping to mitigate the consequences of accidents and reduce the risk of unplanned interruptions.
The system is designed to facilitate job site safety and remembers the last slope the machine climbed for seamless stockpiling operations. Volvo CE says that it can be temporarily deactivated for specific site conditions and only functions when the wheel loader is in reverse and driving between 3-15 km/h. The Collision Mitigation System is a factory-fit option for a range of Volvo wheel loaders and is available globally.
Lars Eriksson, global product manager for wheel loaders at Volvo CE says, “We at Volvo CE continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions which not only mitigate the consequences of accidents but strive to avoid them altogether.
“This new Collision Mitigation System is one important part of our work to reduce the risk of accidents and help fulfil our commitment towards zero accidents.”
Volvo CE has developed the Collision Mitigation System in-house for its line of wheel loaders. This factory-fit option is currently offered on the L110H/L120H equipped with OptiShift, L150H, L180H, L220H, L260H, and L200H High-Lift wheel loaders.
To function, it requires a Radar Detect System to be installed, adding to the existing range of features, options, and site services designed by Volvo CE to promote job site safety and reduce unforeseen interruptions.
The heavy wheeled loader market is certainly busy. Enhancements are being made left, right and centre with almost a solution for everything. As always, it is an exciting time in equipment development and the year is sure to bring about more innovations."
24 May 2023,Why Komatsu has started factory-filling machines with HVO,"

Komatsu’s customers are still concerned about making the switch to hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), four years after the manufacturer approved the fuel for use in its machines.
That’s why the business has taken the decision, announced late last month, to start factory filling its new machines with HVO.
Komatsu is set to start factory filling its new machines in the UK and Germany from this month, with its Italian factory following suit before the summer.
Meanwhile the OEM is investigating the most suitable low-carbon fuel options in other areas of the world.
A Komatsu spokesperson told International Construction, “We have already approved using HVO in 2019 but customers are still concerned about switching to HVO.
“We would like to send a message to them that we are fully approving the use of HVO and encourage customers to make a switch.”
Komatsu said that it had chosen to start with factory filling in Birtley in the UK and Hannover in Germany because production in these factories involved Komatsu engines and the OEM didn’t need any further approvals from other engine suppliers.
And it said that while they admitted the environmental impact of such a move was low, they hoped it would serve as a confidence-boosting measure for customers.
The business, which this month also launched a mid-sized hydrogen fuel cell excavator concept, is targeting a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions from the use of its products and production of its equipment by 2030.
The spokesperson added, “Although the use of fuel at factory fill is very limited, we would like to send a message that we care our products from the production.
“We believe using HVO and other low-carbon fuel is one of the effective solutions to minimize CO2 emissions.
“We are also working on measuring the reduction of CO2 emissions with using HVO or low-carbon fuel in the future, to support customers’ site decarbonisation activities.”
The availability of HVO depends on a customer’s location but Komatsu said it could introduce them to suppliers if they needed assistance getting HVO for their sites. It noted that it was also supporting activities investigating future feedstocks for HVO via its forestry business.
HVO is produced from renewable raw material such as cooking oil and animal fats wastes. It is a drop-in replacement for fossil diesel, but with high cetane, no oxygen and no aromatics.
But not all construction companies agree that HVO is one of the solutions to decarbonising the industry.
Last year, UK-based contractor Balfour Beatty released a position paper in which it warned that there were “serious issues” with HVO that needed to be “ironed out” before it committed to the fuel.
Those issues mainly revolved around the traceability and carbon footprint claims around the fuel. It said, “At the heart of our concerns is the fact that, at the moment, the supply chains in this area are complex and opaque, with insufficient information provided about the sources, transportation and production methods.”
But Komatsu said it believed that HVO and other low-carbon fuels are “effective solutions to minimise CO2 emissions”. It added that so far it had received positive feedback from customers who have used HVO on its sites and stressed that one of the key advantages was that HVO required no special instructions to use."
18 May 2023,"Komatsu, Toyota to develop autonomous light vehicles","

Komatsu Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corp. have launched a joint project to develop an Autonomous Light Vehicle that will run on Komatsu’s Autonomous Haulage System (AHS). To realize further safety and productivity improvements in mines by running autonomous haul trucks and automated ALV controlled by AHS, Komatsu and Toyota will jointly develop new technologies.
As part of the work, Komatsu will develop a new ALV management program on its AHS, while Toyota will develop an ALV which runs autonomously under the control of AHS. Toyota’s light-duty vehicles, especially its Land Cruiser trucks, have long been popular in above- and underground mining.
Both companies are currently testing a concept ALV at their proving grounds, and expect to have a proof of concept at a customer site by January 2024.
Since the launch of AHS in 2008, Komatsu said it has deployed over 650 trucks at 22 sites in five countries.
Currently, when AHS-enabled autonomous haul trucks and manual light vehicles used for maintenance or transport are running on haulage roads at the same time, autonomous haul trucks may decrease their speed or stop when passing light vehicles to avoid possible collisions caused by human error. On the other hand, the company said customer demand for improved productivity in mine operations when it comes to autonomous haul truck operating efficiency remains an issue.
Minerals and energy resources are essential, and autonomy reportedly offers the opportunity to remove people from harm’s way and enhance safety. It can allow mining customers the ability to continue the hard work of providing critical minerals despite the ongoing challenge of labor shortages. It can also provide additional safety measures to mine sites on which multiple pieces of equipment are operated, in an effort to reduce accidents due to human error.
In light of those circumstances and in an effort to solve those issues quickly, Komatsu and Toyota expect its work will accelerate autonomy in mines.
Some of the stated goals for the technology include minimizing speed reductions or brief stops of autonomous haul trucks while passing light vehicles on a haul road, the autonomous transfer of parts for other mining equipment working in the field, and the autonomous transfer of equipment operators for other machines such as loading equipment or bulldozers."
16 May 2023,Komatsu launches mid-sized hydrogen fuel-cell excavator concept,"
The manufacturer said the machine’s development is in line with its aim to achieve carbon neutrality in construction equipment.
The company said Proof of Concept (PoC) tests are underway and it is now accelerating efforts to bring medium-sized and large construction equipment powered by hydrogen fuel cells into commercial production “in the near future”.
Komatsu collaborated with Toyota Motor Corporation on the new excavator, with the development project led by operating officer and president Koji Sato.
The company integrated a hydrogen fuel cell system and hydrogen tank on the hydraulic machine.
Diesel-equivalent performance
The company said it combined Toyota’s hydrogen fuel cell system with its own control technology and key components, achieving zero exhaust emissions, significantly reducing noise and vibration.
Komatsu said the excavator also delivers performance, in terms of digging efficiency and operability, equal to that of the comparable engine-driven machine.
The company states that it aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% from the use of its products and equipment production by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, and has set itself a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
Komatsu claims that, due to hydrogen’s higher energy density and shorter refuelling time compared with battery-electric technology, it has focused its research and development efforts on hydrogen fuel cells as a promising electrification choice for medium-sized and large models."
03 May 2023,Digital construction site steals show on Samoter’s first day,"




Machine control, remote control, autonomy and collision avoidance technology worked together with machines from the likes of Develon, Kobelco and Komatsu, to give the audience a vision of what tomorrow’s construction sites may look like.
Topcon and Leica positioning technology was on show, as well as Trimble’s augmented reality solution, SiteVision.
Caterpillar’s Cat Command System was utilised to demonstrate applications as diverse as the remote control loading of a hauler and the remote removal of an explosive device discovered during excavation.
The show demonstrated the advances that have been made in the area of machine control, as a Komatsu dozer made short work of grading, with the operator a passive observer.
Later, a 23-tonne Develon excavator demonstrated the delicate operations that can now be undertaken using the latest tiltrotator attachments from Engcon and Steelwrist.
Construction’s significance
Earlier, the show, which is running in conjunction with the paving and road infrastructure equipment fair, Asphaltica, opened with with speeches from regional mayors and government ministers, who stressed construction’s importance to Italy, as a vital component of its economic recovery.
Italy’s minister of infrastructure and transport, Matteo Salvini, described the importance of infrastructure developments, mentioning the proposed bridge across the Strait of Messina, which, after many years of debate, is potentially now set to connect the island of Sicily with the mainland.
Samoter’s organisers said the show’s six halls and three outdoor areas will host 536 companies from 23 nations over the course of the week, who will vie for the attention of buyers from more than 100 countries.
Alongside equipment and solutions exhibits, Samoter will also host more than 80 market and technical conferences and workshops."
,Komatsu to switch to HVO as factory-fill fuel,"The move, which is line with Komatsu’s long-term goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and starts this month at plants in Hannover, Germany, and Birtley, United Kingdom.
Komatsu said the combustion engines in its machines – including those produced for the construction and demolition industries – can be operated with HVO, with no modifications required, and described the swich as a major step towards reducing its environmental impact.
HVO is produced from renewable raw material such as cooking oil and animal fats wastes. It is a simple drop-in replacement for fossil diesel, but with high cetane, no oxygen and no aromatics.
Its introduction at Komatsu is part of a sustainability programme that also includes research and development of new technologies and solutions such as electric and hydrogen-powered machines."
11 April 2023,What can construction learn from Japan?,"Japan’s approach to safety and quality in construction goes to lengths that Europe and North America do not come close to. There is much most of us can learn from this, but there are drawbacks too.
Japan has a near obsession with safety. We might like to think in Scandinavia, Western Europe, and North America that we are similarly vexed but the truth is that we come nowhere near.
Visit any construction site in Japan and it is a remarkable experience even for the most seasoned construction professional. Sites are full of health-and-safety professionals, some holding flags, others directing traffic and still others checking this and that ensuring no literal or figurative red lines are crossed, all in the interests of minimising the risk of injury to workers.
In real terms, that translates. In 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively, fatalities in the Japanese construction industry numbered 367, 342, and 377 respectively. In the three years 2019-21, those numbers were 269, 258 and 288 respectively. While Japanese trends have clearly improved, they have flatlined in US construction where 1,008 fatalities occurred in 2020, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Deaths in construction in the US have remained at around 10 in every 10,000 for the decade 2011-20.
Nobody is doubting the efforts to ensure safety in the US or indeed other parts of the world, but the mindset in Japan is different. As an outsider, it seems they are personally affronted by bad numbers, disorder, and anomaly, and will do everything in their power to rectify it. It means generally going above and beyond regulation. It also means a lot of checking and ticking off, much of it manual.
While these checks and processes can be frustrating to outsiders, it’s difficult to knock it, given the numbers. But it’s also where an opportunity for telemetry exists and which can plug a gap that takes some of the manual work out of the process and allow human resource to be freed up elsewhere.
That in itself presents problems though. The typical testing process in Japan can be anything up to 12 months; for businesses that aspire to be fast and agile, this is a hurdle. But there’s no getting around it. The way of working and the culture is so embedded in Japanese business that any attempt to accelerate the process will most likely be met with a flat ‘no’ and a reversion to the way of doing things that has served them so well.
Exactly the same arguments apply to quality standards too. And it’s here that many of the big Japanese manufacturers like Hitachi, Sumitomo and Komatsu are very focused on finding telematics solutions that fit with their strategy and big-budget R&D teams. It is here that the chance to get in on a market that numbers 137 million people and still ranks as the third biggest economy in the world continues to be a big draw to foreign companies despite the difficulties in penetrating the local market.
Part of the reason for that is Japan’s ageing population crisis which will place an ever increasing strain on the economy to make sure their needs are catered for. Japan’s over 75s already account for more than 15% of the population and, on current trajectories, that could more than double by 2040.
That places an enormous premium on technology that can make a difference in all areas of the economy. It is why data-rich telematics providers are all-in on the Japanese market because they meet the quality bar to help manage the age issue.
Japan has stringent 2050 carbon reduction targets with one eye on the health benefits that would spin out from such a development and the increasing reliability of telematics data on CO2 emissions and, more importantly, how to mitigate emissions is just one area where that could help. Fuel management systems, more effective usage of machines, better resource allocation and better all-round efficiency with an emphasis on eliminating downtime in the construction industry would obviously fall into line with Japan’s goals too.
It should never be forgotten that Japan sits in a natural disaster zone that make it vulnerable to earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural phenomena that, as one example shows, led to the Fukushima disaster in 2011 that cost an estimated 18,500 lives.
Indeed, disaster management and crisis management really are a thing in Japan. And it partly explains the extreme levels they go to.
We will all have watched with some horror events unfold in Turkey and North Syria where the death toll on the back of a 7.8 Richter Scale earthquake stood at over 57,000 at the time of writing. In November 2014, Japan suffered a lesser but by no means insignificant quake near the city of Nagano measuring 6.7.
There were no deaths and, it has been reported anecdotally, locals continued with their daily business largely unruffled; almost certainly down to stringent quality standards in local construction. By way of direct comparison, a similar scale earthquake in south Italy in 1980 measuring 6.9 cost 3,000 lives.
Japanese OEMs, in fact, have special protocols in place stipulating the immediate release of their machines in the event of a catastrophe as part of systematic disaster management programs. This is not to make light of the efforts or preparedness of other countries in the face of such tragedy, but it merely illustrates just how ready Japan is on every level to handle crisis both in terms of prevention and aftermath.
In a world where we’re still trying to understand what climate change, rising sea levels and natural disasters will do to the way we live – witness the floods in Germany, the forest fires in Australia and California and other natural disasters – this might in time be where we have most to learn from Japan.

22 March 2023,Komatsu’s tech solutions to boost construction’s productivity,"At ConExpo in Las Vegas, US, Komatsu, one of the world’s largest OEMs, showed its range of technology solutions designed to optimise productivity.
One of these technologies is Komatsu’s Smart Construction Technology. By merging advanced automation and integrated technologies, the OEM says that job sites can be transformed through predictability.
The OEM’s currently available suite of Smart Construction products include: Dashboard, Design, Drone, Field, Fleet, Office, Remote and Retrofit.
At the largest construction show in North America Komatsu also showed its Smart Quarry technology and intelligent Machine Control 2.0​.
The company says that its Smart Quarry solutions are designed to help customers understand, visualise and optimise their job sites. Job site studies provide customers with customised, detailed data that can help them meet production targets.
Smart Quarry allows for continual production monitoring to help increase efficiency, improve production and maintain a high level of performance.
Designed to quickly lessen the skills gap between new and experienced operators, and improve the bottom line for contractors, Komatsu’s intelligent Machine Control (iMC) integrates with the company’s suite of Smart Construction products, services and digital solutions that incorporate a host of advanced, proprietary machine technology.
Among the iMC 2.0 machines in Komatsu’s booth were the PC360LCi-11 excavator, as well as three dozers: D39PXi-24, D51PXi-25 and D71PXi-24.
Komatsu also produced and recently published a video tour of its ConExpo booth, which in addition to technology products, also highlighted other key equipment models on offer such as its next-generation WA475-10 wheeled loader and waste guarding package."
10 March 2023,The sky’s the limit: the latest in drone technology,"Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have been around in the construction industry for a number of years, but it is only in more recent times that their use has become more accepted and their benefits almost universally understood.
Part of this is the common cycle of anything new – it takes time to figure out the best way of utilising a new tool. Jim Greenberg, product manager in the Trimble Civil Engineering division remembers that “In 2018 there was a lot of hype around drones. We were all trying to get our heads around what it really was and what it really meant… There were a lot of things to figure out, and surveyors were getting up to speed with it.”
Finding someone to fly the drone could be an issue, but it wasn’t the biggest one – that was collecting data (and the right data) and then knowing what to do with it, and what it meant. These kinks have now been ironed out to the point that Greenberg, who is a surveyor by trade, says, “now I feel like it’s just a given; like GPS and machine control, people don’t question if it is good anymore.
“They just question how they can apply it. We feel that it’s at the point where it’s accepted and everyone’s starting to look at it. When you put it in someone’s hands, they figure out the added value they can get from it. We have companies that say this is as transformational as machine control was.”
This viewpoint is backed up by Pascal Martinez, director of OEM Development at Bentley Systems. When asked if drones are more accepted in construction now, he answers emphatically, “Yes. Drones have evolved incredibly over the last ten years and, with prices down and increased ease of use, they are becoming a key tool to monitor construction progress.
“Of course, they are mostly used in horizontal construction and the structural work on vertical construction, but there are new drones that can also fly indoors. And their utilisation can be combined with 3D laser scanning to create a complete reality model of a construction site. A key driver of this adoption is also the autonomy, it relieves the need for an expert pilot and enables repeat flights and acquisition at high pace.”
As the technology has developed so has the speed at that data can be processed – data can be uploaded to the cloud and available shortly after for evaluation thanks to the readily available processing power. Some contractors are even flying multiple flights in one day and uploading them simultaneously.
The increasing automation of drones is playing a role in their adoption, as is the fact that the way they
are being used has also evolved. Initially, drones were used across construction to get to locations where people couldn’t get to or were considered too dangerous. However, this is changing, says Barry McGinn, sales director, Capital Projects, Cyberhawk.
“The role of drones is evolving, and they are now being deployed to survey the progress and performance of a project. They’re enabling stakeholders to monitor the site from anywhere in the world,” he comments.
“Drone survey images are now at the same level as terrestrial surveys, but the benefit of drones is that up to 30 times more distance can be covered in a day. The efficiencies that can be made are astronomical. We also now have drones operating with what’s effectively a force field around them, enabling them to fly indoors through structures without risk of collision. This allows for the collection of incredible imagery, giving a photo-realistic view of assets.”
That construction is not the world’s most efficient sector is well known – the industry’s relative lack of productivity gains has been well documented. In order to become more productive and efficient, it first needs to be known what work has taken place; this is where drones and the data they collect are essential.
Collecting data on a site makes it possible to track progress over time to enable project stakeholders to see what areas could become more efficient and also the optimum time for materials to be moved. Swiss-based software company Pix4D is one such company that offers these services.
“PIX4Dcloud Advanced allows constructors to use its timeline feature to track changes over time. The workflow is very straightforward: collect data via drones or mobile devices, process it online with PIX4Dcloud, and then analyse the site,” says Gabriele Ruggiero, business development manager, AEC Solutions at Pix4D
“You can measure distances or volumes, share 3D models, and monitor stockpiles. To track and manage progress, the timeline tool allows you to overlay design plans and maps in order to identify errors early and avoid expensive rework. All of this can be shared online with stakeholders via links as it is hosted online, which means processing and analysis can take place off-site.”
Using drones and software enables firms to document their progress. It means they no longer have to guess how long it takes them to move material – they know exactly. “Drones not only give you great pictures, but you have data you can measure with, like areas, your footages and volume metrics,” says Jason Anetsberger, director of customer solutions at Komatsu. “That data can become the truth for the job site.”
During a preconstruction flight it is possible to compare the real site to the engineer’s model, which allows for any miscalculations to be fixed.
“We had a customer recently who realised they had to move 40,000 cubic yards more than what the engineer quantities were saying they needed to do at the beginning of the job,” comments Jim Petry, Smart Construction solutions manager.
“For them, that was a big revelation. That was the first time that they used a drone. They quickly found a lot of value in it. They can see where their cut and fills are on the site, where that is taking place, and if it’s a large site, they can make better decisions on equipment.”
The potential of this technology goes even further than monitoring – and optimising – a construction site. One of the ways it can be used is to help create and update 3D models.
“This feedback from the field leverages multiple techniques, but companies are now making reality modeling and surveying an essential component of this process, with an increasing adoption of 3D laser scanners, drones, timelapse cameras, and photogrammetry,” says Bentley’s Martinez.
“Moreover, surveying is not only used to monitor progress and control the quality of the construction, but also to create 3D snapshots at key project milestones, that can be archived and reused during maintenance and operations. It is also used to update design models to keep digital twins evergreen and improve the communication between designers and constructors.”
At the moment, in most countries, a drone can only be flown to a point where they remain in the pilot’s line of sight but that may change, says McGinn from Cyberhawk. “I believe we’ll eventually shift to remote flying, which will be transformative in terms of productivity for linear civil engineering projects like roads and railways,” he says.
In addition to this he believes that “In the next five to ten years, we’ll see widespread use of drones for delivery, supporting modern methods of construction. Site data gathered by drones will alert off-site manufacturing assets when facilities such as bathroom pods or heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are required, and drones will be used to deliver those materials at the right time.”
Construction is a fractured industry, with just one large-scale project commonly having numerous contractors and even more subcontractors working on it. Multiple stakeholders can make sharing data difficult but, says Pix4D’s Ruggiero, “Construction platforms are also becoming more straightforward to integrate with, which helps us to support our clients that work with multiple products and service providers.”
Another potential change could be the move towards LiDAR, which uses the light from a laser to collect measurements. At the moment most drones use photogrammetry, which provides consistent ground models. Trimble’s Greenberg says LiDar has advantages, but a change won’t happen for a little while yet.
“When you are flying a drone with LiDar, it has lots of advantages – it can penetrate foliage, but you have to have really accurate orientations and the accuracy just isn’t as good as what we can get out of photogrammetry,” he says.
“If the price point was right and the LiDar was good enough, I’m sure we’d have all drones with LiDar and photos, so maybe five or ten years from now. But I don’t see LiDar taking over from photogrammetry for our applications in the near future.”
There will doubtless be changes to both the physical drones themselves and the software in the future, as well as to how the data is used. One thing that will remain constant though is this branch of construction technology being used to keep the ‘real’ world and the digital world in step. For example, a drone flight on a Sunday night will provide accurate data for a whole team on Monday morning about the exact state of a project.
As Greenberg says, “the real and digital world go out of sync all the time. When you see that the real and digital world are diverging, it’s a way to pull them back together.” As the influence of the digital world grows ever more in construction, having the ability to make sure that this world and the ‘real’, physical world are the same will only grow in importance.
Drone manufacturer Skydio has announced the launch of its new product line, which includes Skydio Dock and Skydio Dock Lite, powered by Skydio’s new Remote Ops software.
US-based Skydio says that its Dock solutions give users complete remote and autonomous visibility into tasks like site inspection and monitoring, mapping, and situational awareness.
Skydio drones housed in Dock and Dock Lite can fly safely with a single off-site operator, or autonomously. Skydio Remote Ops software is said to enhance the drone’s AI-powered autonomy so operators can perform streamlined missions.
Adam Bry, CEO of Skydio, says, “Skydio Dock and Skydio Dock Lite, combined with our Remote Ops software, deliver autonomous capabilities for our customers, whether they are monitoring their warehouses, inspecting a security perimeter, or assessing infrastructure following a natural disaster – finally realising the promise of efficient, scalable remote operations.”
This announcement is made with the participation of Skydio’s Early Access customers and partners, such as the North Carolina Department of Transportation, Southern Company, Caltrans, the Oracle Innovation Lab, and Japan-based Obayashi Construction.
Time compiled the list via solicited nominations from its editors and correspondents around the world, and through an online application process. The company then evaluated each contender on a number of key factors, including originality, efficacy, ambition, and impact.
Hexagon says that the BLK2FLY can quickly and accurately capture everything from large outdoor spaces to complex structures and environments. The resulting colourised 3D point clouds are instrumental in building information modeling (BIM) processes, documenting site conditions, and improving any asset’s operation.
“Having our reality capture technology recognised by Time as one of the year’s best inventions is both humbling and inspiring. It validates our mission to build Smart Digital Realities that empower an autonomous, sustainable future,” says Hexagon President and CEO Ola Rollén."

Nearly 5% bigger than the record set in 2020, the show will feature 1,800 exhibitors and 150 education sessions during its run from March 14-18, 2023.
Despite being the largest show ever, AEM noted that recent additions to the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) will make it the easiest to get around as well. Beneath the entire LVCC campus runs the Convention Center Loop, an underground transportation system designed by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. It transports convention attendees throughout the campus in under two minutes in Tesla vehicles, free of charge.
AEM said attendee registrations were also on strong pace, as pre-registrations are nearly double what they were at the same time for the 2020 show.
“This is the event that construction professionals, especially those making company-level decisions, and those needing professional development hours, can’t miss,” said Caterpillar Senior Vice President Phil Kelliher, who is ConExpo-Con/Agg show chair. “Seeing the new equipment and techniques on a screen doesn’t compare to seeing it all in person.
“At the show, you can see the equipment, ask questions of the manufacturers themselves, and really understand what the equipment and education can do for your career and business.”
A selection of equipment manufacturers are teasing what they have in store for attendees. Alice Banach, senior marketing manager for Doosan Infracore North America, revealed that ConExpo will be the first-time attendees will be able to see the new brand on its construction equipment, hear the story of why it was chosen and what’s coming next.
“In November 2019, Doosan Infracore showed the first successful live demonstration of a fully autonomous excavator and wheel loader. The demonstration took place at our proving grounds in South Korea,” she explains. “We have developed this technology further and will show the next generation of Concept-X in a demonstration area in our exhibit. There will be other new products and technologies on display including the Doosan electric-powered DX20ZE-7 mini excavator.”
The message the company is conveying with its exhibit is a continuation of a long history of orange equipment in North America.
“We are nearing 40 years since we entered this market. We are the same company with the same talented dealers and staff evolving to the next chapter for the industry,” says Banach. “We expect a lot of interest in the new brand, but the most important message is that the machines have not changed, only the name on them,” she said.
The machines on display will include the new DD100 dozer and the first 100-metric-ton crawler excavator: the DX1000LC-7. As for new product introductions, Banach says Doosan will have a few new products that the North American market will see for the first time and some that will be their global debut. “Our second dozer, the DD130, will be shown, as well as the latest working Concept-X models will be on display,” she added.
For its part, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) readies itself for a return to ConExpo for the first time since 2017. The company pulled out of the 2020 show due to looming concerns over the spread of Covid-19, which wound up shortening the show by one day and emptied Las Vegas shortly thereafter.
Stephen Roy, president, Region North America, at Volvo CE, says it’s important for equipment manufacturers to make their presence known to construction industry professionals planning to attend.
“For me, it’s really being able to highlight where Volvo is and where we’re at in our journey during a time that has been transformative in our industry,” he says. “ConExpo-Con/Agg offers us a chance to showcase what we have, gather feedback from our customers and engage our industry partners.
“To really make a show like ConExpo-Con/Agg work, the face-to-face aspect of it is so important,” he adds. “I think that’s why Las Vegas is the perfect venue. It attracts so many people, and with all the changes we’re seeing in our industry, I think it’ll be the perfect environment for people to find the latest and greatest innovations, as well as learn what will help their business succeed.”
Volvo is driving a focus on sustainable power and automation, and how it can help customers be more productive, efficient and successful in their efforts to serve their own customers.
“We always say our goal is to make customers successful with their customers, so that’s the approach we’re taking. More specifically, we’ll have a mix of existing product, product that’s coming out soon and some forward-looking product that – like I mentioned before – will illustrate where the industry is going,” says Roy. “That means a focus on sustainability, using electric machines and other sustainable power.”
Volvo CE will also showcase small compact electric equipment, all the way to larger equipment that has a mix of electric and diesel.
When asked how he feels about Volvo’s return to live, in-person events, Roy says, “We’re very focused on making events and exhibitions like ConExpo-Con/Agg a really valuable experience, so when our attendees are in the booth, they have access to the right information and the right experts who can answer their questions – and we want them to have fun in our booth too.”
Metso Outotec will present its latest innovations, technologies and offerings for the aggregates industry at ConExpo.
“Throughout the whole aggregates and construction industry, sustainability is gaining ground and has become a big driver for innovations and operations,” says Juha Yli-Petäys, SVP, Global Distribution Management at Metso Outotec.
“For us at Metso Outotec, sustainability and improved performance are among our key goals with our customers and present in every R&D project. At ConExpo-Con/Agg, we will demonstrate our groundbreaking innovations that address our customers’ key challenges like energy consumption, uptime, safety or carbon footprint reduction,” he continues.
Product on display will include the Nordberg HP cone crusher and Lokotrack track-mounted crushers and screens – the company has said it will give a ‘sneak peek’ at the future vision of the next generation of Lokotracks. ​
John Deere Power Systems (JDPS) is expanding its product portfolio to include a diversified range of powertrain and electronic solutions. These products will be on display as the company provides insight into how these technologies will impact the industry’s journey towards a more sustainable future.
Show attendees have the opportunity to see JDPS’s first engines based on new architecture, the JD4, JD14, and JD18, all of which will be on display together for the first time. John Deere will also feature its new split path electrical mechanical transmission in the booth, which offers improved productivity, ease of operation, uptime, and efficiency all while paving the way to hybridisation and potential for off-boarding electrical power.
Show attendees will have the opportunity to check out the latest developments in Kreisel immersion cooled batteries and John Deere charging technology in the booth.
Caterpillar will show off more than 30 machines at ConExpo, in what it claims is its largest exhibit to date.
The OEM has taken a 70,000 sq ft demonstration area for the show at the Operator Stadium in the Festival Lot.
Caterpillar is expected to unveil new models as well as battery-powered prototypes with charging stations. It will also offer two main equipment demonstrations each day, with one focused on the latest Cat technology and the other spotlighting the company’s full equipment line-up.
There will also be hubs offering a look at new technology, services and sustainability. Cat will also present daily spotlight demonstrations that dive deep into industry topics like improving fuel efficiency and jobsite efficiency.

The Liebherr booths at ConExpo offers space for more than 30 exhibits on a total exhibition area of almost 5,600m². The area was enlarged by approximately 670m² due to the addition of a demo area, where Liebherr will show its machines in action for the first time at ConExpo.
Numerous new products and developments from the areas of construction machines, cranes and material handling technology are on display. In addition, Liebherr presents the latest innovations from its components product segment in the South Hall.
For the first time in North America, Liebherr is presenting its new medium-sized wheeedl loaders, which are equipped with a wide range of digital assistance systems.
With a significant increase in performance compared to the previous models, the new machines are prepared for demanding applications in various industries such as mining, recycling or the timber industry.
Road construction equipment manufacturer Road Widener will show the FH-R material placement attachment, which it says provides contractors with 50% reduced labour at less cost than a traditional self-propelled equipment.
Additionally, the remote-controlled design of the attachment allows the operator of the host machine to control the attachment via remote control – enhancing safety by eliminating the danger of additional workers standing along the jobsite.
“With the current Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal there is a renewed focus on repairing and reconstructing our nation’s roadways,” said Lynn Marsh, Road Widener president. “Now is the time to modernise our infrastructure, making it safer and more resilient. The FH-R allows contractors to get the job done more quickly and efficiently.”
Trackunit will showcase two major new solutions at ConExpo. The company says that it will introduce a set of site-focused features and capabilities to drive efficiencies in the construction industry to the next level by allowing users to leverage live machine data with connectivity to build their site-based business processes.
In addition to these new site-based capabilities, Trackunit says that fleet owners will have enhanced visibility by removing blind spots on job sites, inside buildings, storage containers, and tool depots alongside a new CO2 reporting solution.
Where job-site coverage needs to be enhanced, Trackunit’s new gateway device will provide continuous Bluetooth connectivity throughout the life of the job site. The gateway device enables visibility to approximate indoor location for Trackunit Kin tracked assets and third-party Bluetooth tags while creating a more robust Bluetooth network on the job site.
Wirtgen will present a cross-section of its cold milling, recycling, soil stabilising and concrete paving products on the joint booth shared by Wirtgen Group and John Deere.
Alongside nine exhibits from three product sectors, the focus will also be on digital system solutions and assistance systems.
Among the equipment on display will be the W 50 Ri, Wirtgen’s powerful half-metre cold milling machine with rear loading. Its features include a simple operating concept and automatic functions. The W 120 Fi front loader has been designed for working widths of up to 1.3 m (4ft 3in).
The F-Series compact milling machine is fitted with a John Deere engine that has been customised to meet the special demands of cold milling applications. Two large F-Series milling machines complete the cold milling machine range on show.
Cold recycling and soil stabilising equipment will also be on show, such as the W 380 CRi as well as the WR 200 XLi and WR 250i. The W 380 CRi with rear loading and a mixing performance of up to 800 t/h is used for rehabilitating wide roads. It can be deployed in both cold in-place recycling (CIR) and in full-depth reclaiming (FDR) projects.
Besides cold recycling, the WR-Series wheel-driven recyclers can also carry out soil stabilising tasks. With a working width of 2.4m (7 ft 10 in) as well as high milling and mixing performances, they are well-equipped for use in demanding projects with high daily outputs. The digital system solutions, the AutoTrac steering system and the WPT (Wirtgen Performance Tracker) documentation system further increase process efficiency.
JCB will present its newly-developed hydrogen internal combustion engine at ConExpo. This will be the debut for the H2 ICE engine in North America and the first time it has been presented outside the UK.
The new engine will be presented as part of the International Fluid Power Exposition (IFPE).
Speaking about the H2 ICE, JCB chairman Lord Bamford, said, “The JCB engineering team has made enormous strides in a short space of time to develop a hydrogen internal combustion engine and it already powers a JCB prototype backhoe loader and a Loadall telescopic handler.
“As the first construction equipment company to develop a fully working combustion engine fuelled by hydrogen, I’m delighted we are now able to present this technology on the international stage.”
The H2 ICE will play a key part in the company’s Road to Zero programme. JCB has already launched what is billed as the world’s first battery-electric mini excavator as part of its E-Tech range.
A range of electric machines produced by JCB will also be on display at the show.
Crushing and screening equipment manufacturer McCloskey will reveal a new colour scheme for its entire product portfolio at ConExpo.
The company, which is known for its distinctive green brand colour, said the updated livery design would create, “a unified and a more contemporary look” across its product range.
Toni Laaksonen, senior vice president at McCloskey International, said, “As McCloskey and its allied brands grow in response to rising demand globally, we continually are seeking new ways to enhance the brand while ensuring we maintain the equity we have built over time.
“This update reflects our commitment to the foundation built on the McCloskey green while refreshing the product line with a modern approach.”
McCloskey’s green colour will now feature on the chassis and galvanized steel handrails of both its existing and new equipment models – which include electric powered and hybrid machines."
22 February 2023,OEMs offer forthright opinions on zero emissions for construction equipment,"



Giovanni Pellizza of JCB said, while electromobility appears to be a good solution for compact equipment, with medium and large machines “the problem of operating autonomy and battery dimensions comes to the forefront; this is why we have been developing hydrogen technology for two years.”
Fabio Ghedini, owner of Ghedini Attachments, questioned what constitutes true electric equipment, saying he believed the majority of machines on the market are merely diesel models with engines removed and electrification added.
He said, “To develop our attachments [to operate with electric equipment]…machinery must also be truly electric and equipped with efficient batteries.”
Emanuele Viel of Komatsu said, “While hydrogen will play a fundamental role in the future, Komatsu believes that the present is hybrid – this technology, compared to conventional systems, reduces emissions on average by 30%. If the entire market were hybrid, this would be an impressive result.”
Further webinars
The second webinar in the run-up to Samoter covers the topic “Earthmoving and digital. A waste of time?” with the recording to be released shortly.
Subsequent webinars will focus on safety, the role of modern rental in the construction chain and will conclude with the webinar discussing photovoltaics in quarries.
"
,Komatsu Europe announces operator aid for wheeled loaders,"The company said its SubMonitor product was the result of customer feedback asking for solutions that deliver safety, real-time information, machine monitoring, efficiency optimisation and other features.
It then combined these features into a single touchscreen, which will be available initially for the manufacturer’s WA380 to WA500-8 range.
Assist systems on Komatsu wheeled loaders include an Extended Load-Pilot, a new rear-view Supervision system with high-definition camera and rear radar obstacle detection, and an Efficiency Module that takes into account different operating conditions.
Komatsu Europe said: “The 30 cm (12.1 in) ergonomic touchscreen provides easy, intuitive operation, reducing confusion and work interruptions.
“It is the base for a new era of machine features that deliver unrivalled control, comfort, and safety.”"
13 January 2023,Why construction equipment OEMs are making acquisitions,"Ola Kinnander, media relations manager at mining equipment giant Epiroc, reels off a list of names; Mernok Elektronik (South Africa), Remote Control Technologies (Australia), Wain-Roy (US), RNP Mexico; just a few of the companies the mining equipment giant has acquired in 2022.
“Acquisitions are part of our strategy for profitable growth,” Kinnander says, pointing to a total of nine acquisitions made in 2022 for companies all over the world specialising in everything from wireless connectivity in mines and collision avoidance systems to rock drill manufacturers and excavator attachments. And that comes after the Swedish giant made eight acquisitions in 2021.
Certainly, since Epiroc was spun out of Swedish engineering group Atlas Copco in June 2018 with an estimated market cap of SEK120bn (US$14bn), the company has been unashamedly acquisitive, spending an estimated SEK3.5bn-SEK4.5bn (US$333m-$428m) on acquisitions in 2022 alone.
Like many construction and mining OEMs, Epiroc has been engaged in an acquisitions arms race, eager to benefit from a post-pandemic boom to buy up firms offering technology.
The goal is to make its machines more efficient, more environmentally sustainable and safer, as well as to gain market share in a market where skills shortages, inflation and supply chain issues have been causing bottlenecks.
For mining equipment manufacturers, like Epiroc, the race has become particularly intensified over the past couple of years because rising demand for commodities has prompted raw materials groups to expand their mines.
Many have started to search deeper underground for mineral deposits – and are opening up markets for technology which can enable them to mine at deeper levels more efficiently.
“We are growing organically but also through acquisitions,” Kinnander says. “They not only add to our revenues but bring us vital technologies and expertise in areas that we are focusing on, including automation, digitalisation, electrification, and the aftermarket. For us it is therefore natural to have more acquisitions than divestments.”
Epiroc’s latest purchase, announced on 13 December 2022, is CR, a 400-strong ground engaging tools provider headquartered in Australia, which produces cast lips, teeth and protective shrouds installed on mining buckets and loaders and whose digital solutions include a real-time GET loss detection system which last year produced revenues of AUS$240m ($164m).
“We focus our acquisitions on the niches that we operate in, which are hard rock mining, mining exploration, and civil engineering and construction,” Kinnander says.
“The acquired company should also be attractive from a growth and profitability point of view and have strong synergies and strategic fit with Epiroc, and they should also be able to have a leadership position within the niche.”
In fact, of the seventeen companies acquired by Epiroc over the last two years, around half produce specialist mining software of some kind, while the remainder mostly produce specialist machinery or electrification expertise.
“New and relevant technology – for example that they provide advanced connectivity solutions or electrification infrastructure – and the competent teams that come with the acquisitions can certainly also be strong factors for why we would be interested in acquiring a specific company,” Kinnander reveals.
And Epiroc is not alone. Caterpillar, Komatsu and Sandvik are just a few of the multinationals which have been on the acquisition trail as part of this new technology arms race.
Sandvik, which also specialises in manufacturing engineering and construction equipment, purchased nine new companies in 2022 and 14 the previous year.
“Shift to growth is a central part of our strategy with focus on organic growth as well as acquisitions,” a Sandvik spokesman says. “We have a strong balance sheet and good cashflow generation that allows for further investments.”
Sandvik points out that research and development traditionally forms a major part of its investment strategy while many of its recent acquisitions have been based around getting hold of cutting-edge digital technology and expanding the company’s expertise in the solid round tools sector.
”We focus on the digital shift where Sandvik enables companies in many industries to boost productivity and become more sustainable with digital solutions, from automated mines with self driving machines to factories where tool data and machining instructions are updated from the cloud,” the spokesman adds.
“Solid round tools is a fast growing segment in which we want to expand. The demand is driven by the transition towards lighter materials and requirements on high precision tools.”
Japanese manufacturer Komatsu announced in June 2022 that it had agreed to acquire Australia-based Mine Site Technologies, a company specialising in improving mining productivity through leveraging communication devices and position tracking systems.
Then, just six months later the company was back on the acquisition trail, buying underground mining specialist GHH Group from the German owned Schmidt Kranz Group.
And Caterpillar, the world’s largest supplier of both mining and construction equipment, too has been boosting its offering with a number of key acquisitions.
These include Australia-based Minetec which supplies high-precision tracking and data communications networks and software to improve productivity and safety.
They also, in May 2022, included US-based Tangent Energy, which uses Energy as a Service (Eaas) software to monitor customers’ energy use patterns and then come up with ways of dispatching resources to maximise return and monitise results without disrupting normal business operations – something which can be especially beneficial for customers with high peak energy demands such as mining operations and data centres.
And Caterpillar started 2023 announcing an investment in US-based battery technology company Lithos Energy, which produces lithium-ion battery packs.
Carl Gustaf Göransson, a former president of construction at CNH Industrial and managing director of Volvo Construction Equipment, who jointly runs off-road consultancy ABCG with Alan Berger, says current business conditions make expansion and diversification particularly attractive to OEMs.
“Throwing money at a problem can both add scale and competence fast,” he says.
“What comes in addition to this in CE [the construction equipment manufacturing industry] is the fact that we have a traditional business undergoing a large transformation in many areas. This includes new business models (e.g., power by the hour), technology, autonomy and the shift from internal combustion engines to electric power.”
Göransson describes the unprecedented pressures on OEMs to buy up tech firms as the “triple technology challenge,” with manufacturers rushing to add technology quickly in three key areas; connected products and automation, alternative fuels and disruptive business models.
Examples of recent acquisitions based around connected products and automation include Doosan Bobcat’s strategic equity investment in US-based startup radar technologies company Ainstein AI to develop hi-tec radar sensor systems for Bobcat equipment.
Deals featuring alternative fuels include CNH Industrial’s decision in April 2021 to take a minority stake in UK-based Bennamann, a company specialising in developing biogas and liquid biofuel from animal waste.
They also include Caterpillar’s 2021 investment in US-based CarbonPoint, a carbon capture specialist that provides technology to concentrate and capture CO2 which can then be either used or buried so that it is kept out of the Earth’s atmosphere.
Disruptive business model acquisitions include engine manufacturer Cummins’s move to invest in California-based asset management and software energy firm Exergy Energy as part of a plan to enable customers to switch to Cummins power systems solutions during outages.
It is not just traditional OEMs who are out to acquire construction tech specialists either. Construction tech firms themselves have also been highly acquisitive as they seek to buy up rivals and add technical know-how to their offerings while the asset class has also attracted venture capitalists and private equity investors.
Construction software giant Trimble’s recent acquisitions include US-based B2W Software in September 2022, France based Bilberry in August 2022 and US-based AgileAssets in December 2021.
Similarly, in September 2021, telematics specialist Trackunit announced it had acquired the Industrial IoT division of competitor ZTR.
Just a few months earlier Trackunit itself announced that software investor Hg had agreed to acquire a controlling interest in the company from Goldman Sachs and GRO Capital.
Michael Staebe, partner at Bain & Co points out that strong demand for tech firms means that they are reaching valuations far higher than similarly sized traditional manufacturing firms.
“Targets with attractive capabilities are highly valued,” he says. “Consider that tech assets trade, on average, at 25 times EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization] with high growth expectations vs. 13 times for targets in the industrial core (and acquirers’ own valuation).
“For example, Hitachi’s acquisition of digital engineering and design firm GlobalLogic at US$9.6 billion implies an EBITDA multiple of more than 37 times.
“Many companies are also taking a portfolio approach to developing these capabilities, through corporate venture capital, joint ventures, and partnerships.”
Moreover, Göransson cautions that the sheer scale of the emerging technology will limit the amount of tech specialisms OEMs can hold.
“The simple fact is that there isn’t enough bandwidth within even quite large OEMs to manage the manifold changes alone,” he says. “Certainly not with their current structure and set up both from a knowledge perspective.”
And, with rampant inflation, high interest rates and the War in Ukraine looking set to lead to a global recession in the coming months, the occupants of many company C-suites may be tempted to rein in their appetites for further acquisitions in 2023.
Yet Göransson predicts that appetite among OEMs for tech companies is so great that the rate of acquisitions is unlikely to slow down in 2023, despite a sluggish economy making business conditions increasingly difficult.
“Normally the appetite for new investments goes down during these times, however combining the extraordinary factors such as post covid, world economy under pressure alongside with the transformation in the industry, we are likely to see a further increase in M&A activities in the coming 12-24 months,” he says.
Back in Sweden, S&P forecasts that Epiroc’s acquisition spending could increase to SEK8bn-SEK10bn (US$761m-$952m) in 2023.
“We are constantly looking for strong and relevant companies to potentially add to the Epiroc family,” says Kinnander. “We are in a strong financial position, and we think and act long-term, so our strategy in this area is not really affected by a looming recession.”"
26 December 2022,What were the top construction stories of 2022?,"Acquisitions, new product launches and the break out of war in Ukraine all come to mind when thinking back on the biggest stories in construction in this year.
This was the year that we started to see a prolonged period of recovery from Covid, while also meeting and overcoming new challenges. As we enter the final weeks of the year, Construction Europe looks at the top stories from construction in 2022.
The €8 billion Ellinkon smart city project by real estate firm Lamda Development took a significant step forward in August when the company opened The Ellinkon Experience Centre in Athens, Greece.
Designed to highlight the magnitude of the smart city project, said to be the largest urban regeneration undertaking anywhere in Europe, the interactive Centre has been built on the site of the former Athens International Airport.
Construction Europe published its list of the Top 100 construction companies in Europe 2022.
France-based Vinci once again came out on top, and extended the lead from second placed Bouygues’ Construction Divisions in the process.
Three of the top five companies on the list are France-based, while only one company managed to break in to the top 10 this year, Spanish firm Acciona.
US-based utility firm Ditch Witch unveiled what it claims to be the largest directional drill in the world at Bauma.
The AT120, which will enable users to drill long, large diameter bores, comes with a Stage V Cummins engine, 533.8 kN of thrust and pullback and 21,015 Nm of rotational torque.
Ditch Witch says the machine will be rolled out globally in the future, and is particularly ideal for pipeline, oil field, gas, sewer and water work.
The first Volvo Days event to take place since Covid saw the company reveal its 22 tonne electric excavator the EC230.
The battery-electric machine runs on four 66kW lithium-ion batteries, which are said to enable it to reduce running costs by up to 70% when compared with its diesel-powered version.
Although currently unavailable commercially, the EC230 is undergoing testing before it officially launches.
Rolls-Royce SMR and Škoda JS will collaborate on the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the Czech Republic and other parts of Central Europe after the respective companies signed a memorandum of understanding in September.
Rolls-Royce say the partnership will allow it to develop and deploy its own SMRs in the future, through the utilisation of ‘Škoda JS’ experience of producing pressurised water reactors,’ with which SMRs are based on.
At the beginning of the year, Saint-Gobain UK and Ireland announced details of the sale of three of its UK-based brands.
The company finalised the sale of the distribution businesses, Neville Lumb, DHS and Bassetts, which specialise in plumbing, heating and sanitaryware products.
The sale of the companies to Wolseley UK was finalised in March. Following the completion of the transaction, Saint-Gobain also announced the respective companies were finalising the sale of its Ideal Bathrooms subsidiary, which concluded in February.
Representing construction giant Caterpillar at Bauma was its German dealer Zeppelin, and at the trade show the company unveiled four elecrtric prototype machines.
These included the 20 tonne 320 medium electric excavator, 950 GC medium electric wheeled loader, 301.9 electric compact excavator and, 906 electric compact wheeled loader.
The machines are powered by Cat’s 48v, 300v and 600v lithium-ion batteries and, according to Product specialist Alan Davies, each model features on board charging capability.
The compact excavator and wheeled loader are expected to be launched in 2024, with no confirmation yet as to when the 950 GC and 320 will be available.
Global economic analysis specialist ING released its EU Construction Outlook report for 2022 in February, which revealed a projected output growth of 2.5% for the year.
The company said that its findings revealed that business confidence at the beginning of 2022 was positive, and despite rising costs and material shortages, the EU construction sector could expect growth in 2022 and 2023.
However, the report was carried out before the breakout of war in Russia, which has impacted the sector and as a result, ING published new findings in September to reflect this.
Having been delayed due to the pandemic, the aforementioned global trade show Bauma returned for the first time in three and a half years in Munich, Germany, in October.
Although visitor numbers were down on previous years, organiser Messe Munchen said nearly half a million visitors attended, with an array of construction equipment on show across the week-long event.
While there was plenty of diesel-powered machines on show at Bauma, this year saw electric machines take centre stage, with manufacturers keen to showcase the latest developments in environmentally-friendly machinery.
When war broke out in Ukraine in late February, the repercussions were felt around the world. An already fragile supply chain was further impacted by the events, while prices of oil and gas rocketed as the news broke.
This was, of course, felt by the construction sector, with manufacturers relying on materials and oil and gas from Russia.
The initial response from many within the sector was to condemn the actions of Russia,  and throughout the course of the next few weeks and months, companies such as Aggrekko, Dinolift, Hitachi Construction Machinery, Komatsu and JCB all ceased operations in Russia.
More recently, the EU confirmed it could seize €300 billion from the Russian Central Bank to rebuild Ukraine."
21 December 2022,Komatsu buys underground mining manufacturer,"Komatsu is to acquire GHH Group (GHH), the German manufacturer of underground mining, tunnelling and special equipment.
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2023 and no financial details have been disclosed.
Based in Gelsenkirchen, GHH was founded in the 1960s and is currently part of the German-owned Schmidt Kranz Group.
GHH makes load haul dumpers (LHD), underground dump trucks, face drills, bolters and utility trucks and vehicles.
The acquisition will add GHH’s factories and rebuild facilities in key markets, including a manufacturing plant in South Africa.
Peter Salditt, president and CEO, Komatsu Mining Corp, said; “We are very excited about this acquisition as it represents a great opportunity for Komatsu to expand its offerings for underground mining equipment and accelerate new product development through synergies with Komatsu’s existing team and product offerings.
“By adding GHH’s factories and rebuild facilities in key markets in Europe, South Africa, India and Chile, we also aim to strengthen production and service capabilities for our customers.”
Komatsu said GHH would operate “as usual” following the acquisition; “The combined team will then work together to expand Komatsu’s offering for underground mining equipment and increase customer access to products in new territories.”
The CEO of GHH, Dr Jan Petzold, said the company was excited to work with a “strong player in the mining world. This opens huge doors for our people and our products to develop further and grow beyond what we could have hoped for.
“This is the next logical step in becoming a true global player and we look forward to becoming part of the Komatsu family.”"
14 December 2022,What climate pledges are being made in construction?,"With a couple of clicks of his computer keyboard, Marius Verwoerd, VP for Sustainability at Finnish mining equipment manufacturer Metso Outotec scrolls through a series of charts on the company website to show the carbon emissions.
In 2021, Metso produced 52,216 tonnes of carbon dioxide from its own operations, an increase of 14% from the 44,913 tonnes in 2020, but down 58% compared with 2019. This was mostly achieved, Verwoerd says, by switching energy sources from fossil fuels to renewables or renewable energy certificates where that isn’t possible.
That, he says, is keeping the company on track to meet its latest emissions reduction targets, set by the company in 2021, promising to halve CO2 output compared with 2019 levels and to ‘net zero’ by 2030.
Net zero is the point at which the amount of carbon emissions produced by the company will be so low it will be balanced out by the amount it removes from the atmosphere.
“Yes we are on track to reach our target,”Verwoerd says confidently. “We have quite a long history of setting climate related emissions targets in the company.
“We are also clear about what the next steps between now and 2030 will be. We have a company-wide roadmap for how we plan to achieve our target.”
And Metso is far from alone. More construction organisations than ever are signing up to ambitious climate pledges to reduce their carbon footprints as companies around the world face unprecedented pressure from customers, employees, shareholders and lenders to operate in a more environmentally sustainable manner.
An International Construction analysis of the sustainability reports produced by a selection of 50 of the world’s biggest contractors, construction equipment OEMs and rental companies, found that nearly all of them had made some sort of commitment to reducing emissions and improving their impact on the environment – see the box below for the full list.
Encouragingly, there are signs that these efforts are bearing fruit. Research from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), a UN-backed organisation which has become the gold standard in assessing corporate climate pledges, found that companies with approved targets collectively reduced direct emissions by 12% in 2020.
Even taking into account the effect of the Covid pandemic during this time, the organisation reported that SBTi companies have delivered “excess reductions in comparison to their peers within their countries.”
However, there are still big caveats.
At the COP27 climate change summit in Egypt this year, the UN climate science panel reported that global CO2 emissions are on track to increase by around 1% this year, making it even harder for the world to avoid disastrous levels of climate change.
Although much of the blame for this rests with world governments, the fact remains that many of the world’s biggest emitters have yet to sign up to a voluntary agreement.
Moreover, delegates heard that many of the corporate pledges which have been made are either not ambitious enough, or are not being implemented – leaving companies open to allegations of ‘greenwashing’.
“Despite [the] growing [number of] pledges of climate action, global emissions are at an all time high and they continue to rise,” UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres told the conference. “To avert a climate catastrophe, we need bold pledges but matched by concrete, measurable action.”
For a start, although many companies have pledged to cut emissions, fewer of these have agreed to become net zero within an agreed time frame. Of the 50 companies surveyed by International Construction, around half had published a specific commitment to become net zero. Moreover, there was a significant variation over the timescales by which the companies surveyed hoped to achieve net zero.
Just two – Metso Outotec and Canadian engineering company SNC Lavalin Group – stated an aim of becoming net zero by 2030. Swedish vehicle and equipment manufacturers Scania and Volvo Group, said that they aimed to become net zero by 2040, while another 15 explicitly said that they would become net zero by 2050 – the year by which the UN says global emissions must fall by almost 50% to keep global temperature rises to a 1.5ᵒC target.
A UN commission convened to assess the robustness of these corporate climate pledges, chaired by Catherine McKenna, a former Canadian minister of environment and climate change, found that even amongst those firms which had made a commitment to net zero, progress on emissions reduction was patchy and difficult to assess.
According to McKenna’s report, delivering on net zero requires three key measures.
Firstly, putting in place short, medium and long term plans to show how they will achieve their goal.
Secondly, focussing on reducing their own emissions as much as possible rather than buying carbon credits to offset their emissions.
Finally, addressing carbon emissions across their entire value chain – the ones produced by suppliers and customers – as well as the ones caused by their own operations.
“If you’re saying to the world ‘I am net zero’ then there is a price of admission,” McKenna told the conference. “You need to walk the talk. You need to deliver on it.”
One way in which many companies are attempting to put clear plans in place is by joining the SBTi, an initiative led by the UN Global Compact and involving a partnership of ‘green’ organisations and charities such as WWF, CDP and the World Resources Initiative.
The initiative works with businesses around the world to agree science-based target that limits a business’s global share of greenhouse gas emissions.
The initiative has quickly grown to become the gold standard for independently-verified corporate emissions targets with more than 4,000 businesses around the world already signed up, including 22 of those surveyed by International Construction.
Karl Downey, senior technical manager at the SBTi says that the organisation helps each individual company set meaningful emissions targets by assessing current emissions levels and plans to reduce them compared with those of industry peers.
Then, using a computer algorithm to work out how the proposed cuts would tie in with global emissions targets to keep warming to well below the 2ᵒC (or preferably 1.5ᵒC) above pre-industrial levels proposed in the Paris Climate Agreement.
Downey says that although the SBTi is unable to check whether companies are telling the truth about their emissions or sticking to their plans once they have set them, the initiative is important because it adds to the pressure corporates are facing to make meaningful changes to their operations.
“For the construction sector, the technology to enable companies to make these emissions cuts is already there,” Downey says. “The challenge we face is that the sector is so fragmented that we need to get lots of different individuals to each cut their emissions.”
Echoing McKenna’s second point, Downey says that the biggest problem his organisation comes up against in the construction sector when attempting to agree corporate climate pledges is the number of companies who propose that, rather than cutting their own carbon emissions, they plan to reduce their overall carbon footprint by investing in ventures such as renewable energy projects or tree planting - known as carbon offsets.
“We see a number of attempts at greenwashing but offsetting is definitely the biggest one,” Downey says.
“We are against using offsets as a way of meeting corporate targets, although we do say that of course companies can finance additional emissions reductions beyond their science-based target or net zero target.”
Some environmentalists go further, pointing out that tree planting events and the like have poor success rates and can even have a detrimental effect on the environments they are supposed to help.
“Carbon offsets mean climate sabotage,” Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International told the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021.
“They aren’t just a tool to greenwash climate inaction and delay the transformation we need, they’re also going to drive devastating land grabs in the Global South.”
Other ways companies attempt to manipulate their emissions targets, says SBTi’s Karl Downey, include choosing an atypical base year from which to measure their emissions reductions, or by attempting to make their emissions cuts sound bigger by calculating tonnes of CO2 emitted per US$1m of company sales.
“These figures can provide a useful way of looking at corporate emissions but overall we need to see total carbon emissions,” he says.
Claire Danamur, a sustainability analyst at ESG ratings agency EcoVadis, says that, although most large companies in the construction industry in Europe are capable of producing detailed and reliable information about the carbon emissions they produce through their own operations (scope 1 emissions) or the energy they buy from outside sources (scope 2).
Many face significant challenges when assessing scope 3 emissions - the greenhouse gasses produced by both the company’s suppliers and its customers. (In the case of equipment rental businesses, scope 3 emissions would include the carbon emitted by their machines when used by customers.)
“Some 20-50% of a building’s lifetime emissions take place during the construction phase,” Danamur says. “Every project is unique and involves a team of engineers, architects, consultants, suppliers and subcontractors that may not have worked together before.
“Furthermore, building materials are often sourced from global markets where labour and occupational health standards vary. This makes it challenging for global construction firms to account for all actors within their value chain.”
In the International Construction survey, only 20 of the 50 companies surveyed made any mention at all of scope 3 emissions at all in their climate pledges.
Downey says the SBTi is developing specific methodologies and guidance for some companies in the building sector which will require them to make greater scope 3 emissions cuts than average to account for a predicted 75% growth in the floor area of buildings between 2020 and 2050.
Back at Metso, Marius Verwoerd says that one of the ways his company aims to ensure it is working towards hitting its carbon reduction targets is by regularly publishing detailed data about a range of sustainability metrics including scope 1,2 and 3 emissions, the amount of water it uses and the amount of energy it consumes.
For president and CEO Pekka Vaurramo to receive his full share bonus in 2024, the Metso Outotec board has stipulated that one of the key performance metrics, carrying a weighting of 10%, is that the company must achieve its carbon emissions improvement target of reducing scope one and two CO2 output by 50% compared with 2019.
“In our company where sustainability is linked to our management’s renumeration and to our finance arrangements, as well as externally verified, we consider sustainability data as important as any other data in the company,” Verwoerd says.
“The more companies embed sustainability into their business models, and the more regulators ensure that regulations related to sustainability reporting push companies to be precise and open about their sustainability actions and data, the less likely ‘greenwashing’ will become.”
Yet with the wave of climate pledges made following the COP26 summit last year followed by a number of lawsuits about greenwashing in advertising campaigns, many firms are choosing not to publicise the details of their climate goals in an effort to avoid scrutiny and allegations of greenwashing.
A study of 1,200 companies by UK-based climate consultancy South Pole, found that although corporates are setting more net zero goals than ever before, with more science based goals to back them up and to more ambitious timelines, around a quarter said that they planned not to announce these targets to the public – a process it describes as ‘greenhushing.’
“More than ever we need the companies making progress on sustainability to inspire their peers and make a start,” says Renat Heuberger, CEO of South Pole. “This is impossible if progress is happening in silence.”
Critics also point out that the current voluntary system of emissions reporting and reduction includes no way to ensure that companies stick to the targets they have set themselves.
Even independent third party organisations like SBTi have faced criticism of potential conflicts of interest over the fact that they charge companies a $9,500 fee to assess their climate goals – funding which the SBTi’s Downey says makes up “only a small proportion of the organisation’s funding,” and about which it is “very transparent.”
“It’s tough to go and figure out who’s greenwashing and who’s not,” said Al Halvorsen, Vice President of ESG at Sunbelt Rentals, a subsidiary of the UK-based Ashtead Group, speaking at the Access, Lift & Handlers conference in Chicago, earlier this year. “There are companies that go out and set very aggressive goals, don’t reach their goal, and then five years later they set another aggressive goal.
“You look at the transparency of the company and if companies are honest in saying, ‘here are our challenges, here’s our performance’, and they don’t try to hide some of the faults that they have, I would say that would be a sign of somebody maybe who is not greenwashing. If you hear somebody making claims that they can’t or won’t back up – that would raise a flag to say, I wonder if that’s true or not.”
To combat this, the UN High Level Expert Group on Net Zero Emissions Commitments’ top recommendation is for governments around the world to introduce regulations and standards in areas including net zero pledges, transition plans and disclosures in order to ensure that companies are both consistent and transparent about their emissions.
“Voluntary schemes are not enough,” the UN’s Catherine McKenna said. “Regulation will be essential here, both to ensure that voluntary climate roadmaps are replaced by mandatory strategies and to level the playing field.
“If we are to avoid a future where our children are buying ‘net zero’ bacon between floods and fires, we must close the gap between the promises we hear and the action we need.”

05 December 2022,Komatsu comments on Russia policy,"Komatsu said it had no immediate plan to withdraw completely from its Russian operations.
The company halted shipments to Russia and also local manufacturing following the Ukraine invation, but still offers maintenance services for its machines in the country, reported Reuters.
“At the moment, like we said in April, we are not considering withdrawal. But various developments could take place as we go forward,” said Komatsu Chief Executive Hiroyuki Ogawa in an online interview with reporters.
“There may come a time when we will need to decide whether or not to withdraw [from Russia]. But that’s not something we are considering at the moment.”
Komatsu has a manufacturing plant in Yaroslavl, Russia.
Russia and other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) accounted for 7% of Komatsu’s heavy machinery sales in the year to end-March 2022.
Komatsu in October posted a 75% jump in net profit for the first half of the current business year thanks to strong heavy machinery demand and a softer yen, and raised its full-year net profit forecast by 32% to a record 298 billion yen ($2.21 billion).
Ogawa warned, however, that global demand will likely slow in the next business year due to higher interest rates, inflation and slower economic growth.
“I don’t necessarily think demand in the next business year will be good when compared with this year’s,” Ogawa said.

29 November 2022,Sales for surface mining equipment up,"Shipments of surface mining equipment during the third quarter of the year were higher than in the previous quarter by 3.5% in units and by 1.4% in valuation, according to the latest surface mining equipment index from the Parker Bay company.
Deliveries in the third quarter were up significantly year-on-year: units delivered were up nearly 16% and value of shipments 12.3%.
Regarding sales by geographic regions, Australasia recovered from a modest Q2 decline with Q3 deliveries up 17%. Compared to a year ago, the Continent is up a remarkable 69%, primarily thanks to strong deliveries to Indonesia.
Sales in North America recorded only a modest gain compared to Q2 but are now up by more than 50% compared to a year ago.
African mines reversed much of the Q2 increase as did miners in Asia. Despite hosting some of the biggest copper, gold and iron mines, Latin America recorded a fourth consecutive drop in shipments, which are now 43% below a year ago.
There were no substantive shifts between product lines within the quarterly totals except for wheeled loader shipments, which dropped 18%. Trucks were up 6%, dozers 4%, and hydraulic shovels/excavators at the same level as the last quarter.
Parker Bay said that the company anticipate future growth due in part to the much higher oil prices and mines’ stated plans to upgrade existing truck fleets to autonomous drive."
