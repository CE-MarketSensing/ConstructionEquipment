29 May 2023,Kubota unveils new excavator,"Kubota has unveiled its latest addition to its line of mini excavators with the new 8.5 tonne KX085-5.
The excavator, which is said to come with more than 20 improvements over the previous ‘dash 4’ model, is powered by a low-emission Kubota engine and can be equipped with a two-piece boom for expanded working range.
The KX085-5 includes an auto-idling system that automatically reduces the engine RPM to idling speed when the control levers are left in neutral for more than four seconds.
Kubota says the machine was designed to “ensure operators can save energy and running costs, as well as reduce noise and exhaust emissions” and boost work efficiency and increase productivity through its hydraulic mechanism that enables operators to run the arm, boom, bucket, and swivel simultaneously.
Other features include two auxiliary circuits with adjustable maximum oil flow, load sensing hydraulic system, float function, auto-shift system, a redesigned cab with wider entry point and floor and an Engine Auto Stop system that comes as standard that will automatically turn off the engine when an adjustable idling time has passed.
Elsewhere in the cab, a double adjustable air suspension seat for greater levels of comfort and operability comes as standard, while a full-colour, high resolution 7” LCD digital display screen ensures users can view all relevant operational information at a quick glance.
The machine, which is scheduled for its first Delivery in July, was shown to Kubota dealers in the UK last week alongside two new electric RT compact wheel loaders, which were first seen at Bauma last year.
The RT210-2e and RT220-2e are both powered by a 48V system with modular 260Ah lithium-ion batteries as standard and can be recharged via a Standard Integrated 40A on-board charger in seven hours. An optional supercharger can charge the machines fully within 90 minutes.
The RT210-2e’s long loader arm has a reach of up to 2,852mm, while the RT220-2e shorter loader arm has an increased lift capacity of up to 1,140kg.
Both the compact loaders and mini excavator will make their public debut next month at UK trade show plantworx."
26 May 2023,Heavy wheeled loaders: The workhorse of the construction site,"Heavy wheeled loaders have a home in almost every construction site and operators are spoilt for choice with the innovative machines manufacturers are releasing.
Komatsu Europe displayed the new WA800-8 wheeled loader at the demo ground at Bauma Munich in October 2022. The loader is said to have been designed for maximum operating comfort in addition to featuring a modulation clutch, variable traction control, an auto kick down and an RPM set.
The Japan-based company has also redesigned the machine’s extra-large 11.5m³ bucket, complete with its optimised maximum fill feature.
With a total operating weight of 115 tonnes, the WA800-8 meets the latest EU stage V emission regulations with a Komatsu-designed, developed and manufactured engine and after-treatment system.
“Our WA800 has always been well-appreciated for its reliability and productivity”, says Jo Monsieur, group manager for large machines at Komatsu Europe.
“And this latest generation surely continues this legacy. Furthermore, Komatsu has really set new standards for stability, comfort and safety and we are very proud to be able to offer this to our customers.”
Liebherr’s XPower wheeled loaders have established themselves at the forefront of fuel efficiency and robustness.
Liebherr says one reason is their power-split travel drive, installed as standard in all Liebherr XPower wheeled loaders. The combination of hydrostatic drive – advantageous for material uptake and travelling over short distances – and mechanical drive ensure that the machine works at maximum efficiency.
In addition to the two drive types, Liebherr offers a range of intelligent assistance systems for its mid-size and XPower wheeled loaders, including active personnel detection with brake assistance. The optional assistance system warns the machine operator of hazards in the rear area of the machine. Sensors and artificial intelligence combine to distinguish between people and objects for additional safety. As soon as the sensors detect a source of danger, the brake assistant automatically decelerates the wheel loader‘s speed. This shortens the stopping distance by multiple feet, reducing the frequency and intensity of potential accidents.
In Denmark, 40 Liebherr XPower wheel loaders are being used for material handling at RGS Nordic – which specialises in recycling construction and demolition waste materials.
Michael Jørgensen, strategic purchasing manager, commented, “The Liebherr wheel loaders need less fuel, are powerful and have hardly any downtime. We are particularly impressed that we achieve 30% more productivity with the same fuel consumption than with comparable wheel loaders in this size class.”
RGS Nordic was in the market for efficient wheel loaders with power-split drive to reduce CO2 emissions. With the company’s main focus on converting construction waste into reusable and circular products that can be integrated into the product cycle, it was important for the machinery used to reflect the same values.
Develon, formerly known as Doosan Construction Equipment, now offers the company’s latest generation ‘DL-7’ wheel loader range driven by new Stage V compliant engines and providing higher productivity, increased fuel efficiency and a low cost of ownership, coupled with a new cab offering an enhanced experience for the operator.
The four biggest standard models in the DL-7 range are the DL420-7, DL480-7, DL550-7 and DL580-7. The machines feature redesigned buckets offering up to 7% more capacity with maximum bucket capacities from 4.5 to 6.4 m3. Develon says that this provides increased productivity for a wide range of material-handling applications.
In addition to the company’s wheel loader range, Develon has introduced the ‘world’s first “transparent bucket” system’ for wheel loaders. The system is said to enable the wheel loader driver to see the blind spots in front of the machine’s bucket, using a monitor installed in the cab. By recording images with top and bottom front-loaded cameras and projecting the combined images in real-time using a curved projection method, the transparent bucket system provides a full view for the driver.
Develon says that the transparent bucket system addresses the issue of safety concerns caused by blind spots in front of wheel loaders due to their buckets. With this new feature, drivers can now easily check blind spots in front of the bucket via the cab monitor, increasing safety and reducing accidents.
Moreover, the transparent bucket system is said to enhance work efficiency by providing a forward view for the driver during loading, unloading, or carrying materials like aggregates, sand, and soil.
The company has applied for patents in Korea, North America, Europe, and China, making it the first company to develop and implement a front projection function with a transparent bucket for construction machinery.
A Develon spokesperson stated that advanced safety systems have become crucial in equipment selection with increasing safety standards. The company plans to continue developing safety features that prioritise driver and worker safety, aiming to lead the industry towards safer and accident-free construction sites.
Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has taken a major step forward in advancing its electromobility offerings with a new solution.
The company has converted its L120 wheel loader into an electric version, catering to the increasing demand for sustainable solutions in the mid-size range. The conversion was done in collaboration with partners Parker Hannifin and CE Engineering Solutions, a Volvo Group subsidiary.
The L120H Electric Conversion, available to selected customers in Europe from 2023, will provide the same performance as the conventional machine while emitting zero emissions.
Volvo CE says that it is committed to achieving a carbon-neutral construction industry and has partnered with CE Engineering Solutions and other electromobility partners to accelerate the availability of commercialised electric solutions across all segments and applications. This collaboration is part of the company’s efforts to expand its line of electric wheel loaders, following its investment in Dutch manufacturer Limach in June to broaden its electric excavator portfolio.
The L120H Electric Conversion is expected to provide numerous benefits to the construction industry, including reduced noise pollution, lower operating costs, and increased productivity. The machine’s electric powertrain also offers instant torque, making it more responsive and efficient than traditional combustion engines.
In addition, the electric version is designed to require less maintenance than its diesel counterpart, reducing downtime and increasing overall equipment availability.
Powered by 240 kWh batteries, the L120H provides a runtime of approximately five hours in most medium-duty applications. Consistent with Volvo’s existing charging solutions, it is estimated to charge from 0-100% in just 1.5-2 hours.
Carl Slotte, head of sales region Europe at Volvo CE, says, “There is no time to wait – we need to deliver solutions that allow our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Change starts here.
“Our commitment to partnership allows us to take a leading position in transforming our industry, with electric solutions that are built to fulfil market demand and tailored to suit the changing needs of our customers. Working together, we are scaling up our portfolio of electric machines, extending the versatility of our range and transforming our industry towards a carbon-neutral future.”
Depending on market demand, Volvo CE says there could be the possibility to convert existing users’ L120H wheel loaders to electric in the future.
Beyond sustainability, Volvo CE is significantly developing the safety systems that are available on their wheeled loaders.
Volvo CE has launched its Collision Mitigation System for Volvo Wheel Loaders, which aims to support operator response and reduce the risk of collision when working in reverse. The feature automatically applies the service brakes when the wheel loader approaches an obstacle, helping to mitigate the consequences of accidents and reduce the risk of unplanned interruptions.
The system is designed to facilitate job site safety and remembers the last slope the machine climbed for seamless stockpiling operations. Volvo CE says that it can be temporarily deactivated for specific site conditions and only functions when the wheel loader is in reverse and driving between 3-15 km/h. The Collision Mitigation System is a factory-fit option for a range of Volvo wheel loaders and is available globally.
Lars Eriksson, global product manager for wheel loaders at Volvo CE says, “We at Volvo CE continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions which not only mitigate the consequences of accidents but strive to avoid them altogether.
“This new Collision Mitigation System is one important part of our work to reduce the risk of accidents and help fulfil our commitment towards zero accidents.”
Volvo CE has developed the Collision Mitigation System in-house for its line of wheel loaders. This factory-fit option is currently offered on the L110H/L120H equipped with OptiShift, L150H, L180H, L220H, L260H, and L200H High-Lift wheel loaders.
To function, it requires a Radar Detect System to be installed, adding to the existing range of features, options, and site services designed by Volvo CE to promote job site safety and reduce unforeseen interruptions.
The heavy wheeled loader market is certainly busy. Enhancements are being made left, right and centre with almost a solution for everything. As always, it is an exciting time in equipment development and the year is sure to bring about more innovations."
26 May 2023,Wacker Neuson creates attachments business,"Wacker Neuson is creating a dedicated business unit for attachments for its products such as excavators, telehandlers and wheeled loaders.
The new division, which will become part of the company’s Aftermarket unit, will be led by managing director Reinhold Baisch, who has 25 years of experience in the construction equipment market, including many years with compaction specialist Hamm.
Alexander Greschner, CSO of the Wacker Neuson Group, said; “This further professionalisation of our attachments business will enable us to strengthen and build on this field, positioning us here also as a comprehensive customer-centric solution provider in the construction and agricultural sectors.”
Reinhold Baisch added; “The right attachments transform our compact machines into the versatile helpers our agricultural and construction customers have come to know and expect.
“We are also seeing exciting developments in this area, with digital assistance systems and standardised interfaces playing an increasingly important role.
“I am very much looking forward to establishing and advancing this segment.”"
18 May 2023,Digging with a twist: What are the advantages of a tiltrotator?,"Popular in Scandinavia, and growing in other areas of Europe, the tiltrotator is deemed to significantly increase machine efficiency.
The tiltrotator can look like a confusing bit of kit but it is possible to think of it as a wrist that directly connects to the excavator’s arm or beneath the excavator’s quick hitch. The tiltrotator is then connected to the excavator’s hydraulics and electrical system. Depending on the excavator’s extra hydraulics, control is adapted to suit different types of control system.
In the early 1980s, the Norgrens family introduced the Tiltrotator to the Swedish market under their family-owned and operated company Noreco, and since then it has become a standard in the Scandinavian region. The concept has also recently gained popularity in many other countries across the globe, including the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the United States.
Sven-Roger Ekström, senior product manager at Rototilt, understands the capabilities of tiltrotators better than most and believes that they have several benefits that could change the way we work on construction sites.
Upon asking Ekström why everyone should have a tiltrotator, he reels off a list of what he believes are the key advantages. “Your excavator becomes an efficient tool carrier in addition to working faster and more flexibly with fewer machine movements.”
Ekström adds that such qualities allow companies to take on new types of jobs and will require less manual labour around the machine.
Unfortunately, the skills shortage is as much a concern as it was in 2022 and including a new attachment into the field can cause apprehension for potential buyers, who may be uncertain about imposing such a complex attachment on operators.
Ekström, however, says it takes only a short time to become proficient with a tiltrotator. “If you are a skilled excavator operator you will need 1-2 weeks to perform really well. After that first jumpstart, you will start to see new opportunities such as how to solve working tasks in a new way and become even more efficient.”
Stefan Stockhaus, CEO of Steelwrist, believes that tiltrotators are also the answer to increasing safety in potentially dangerous working conditions. By using tiltrotators, jobs traditionally done outside the cabin can be moved into the cabin, removing ground workers from risk-prone roles. “It’s not all about efficiency,” he says. “It’s also about safety and becomes an alternative to a standard factor.”
Increasing efficiency is undoubtedly a huge advantage on the modern-day construction site and Ekström says tiltrotators can increase efficiency by 25% to 30% depending on the type of job. “On some jobs where you, with the combination excavator plus tiltrotator, can do the same job as two or three standard excavators you of course calculate with even higher figures,” he adds.
Steelwrist’s Stockhaus agrees with Rototilt’s Ekström regarding his sentiments on the tiltrotators ability to increase efficiency, but he adds that enjoyment is also a benefit. “In our case, 96% of all the experienced users say that the job is more fun. And if the job is more fun, it’s easier to attract good employees. Those are two really strong cases. As I see it anyway – efficiency, profitability, but also more fun.”
Mature markets, such as Scandinavia, have embraced the adoption of tiltrotators. Almost 90% of excavators in the region have the attachment, which is said to be crucial to winning projects as well as meeting specific sustainability goals.
While Scandinavia has fully adopted this form of attachment, the rest of Europe is somewhat slower. “It always take time to break new ground and to change old habits,” says Ekström.
“In Scandinavia, we have a long practice of getting more efficient because of expensive, and the lack of manual labour. We also have a market with many small contractors that often see the owner in the cab working with the equipment; therefore, he can quickly see the benefit of working in a new way.”
Stockhaus believes the popularity surrounding tiltrotators in Scandinavia comes from the region’s pressure on increased productivity – it is also the key to getting jobs.
Elsewhere in Europe, Ekström says that big companies with a large rental market often take longer to see the benefits. Other obstacles, he says, can be that as long as the contractors are satisfied with buying two or three machines instead of one machine with a tiltrotator, the dealers will not push the product until the customer asks for it.
Autumn 2022 saw Rototilt launch its Rototilt Control product concept featuring tiltrotators, joysticks, a new control system and a remote support app. The product has become well established in the market and companies are starting to realise their potential – Rototilt are now expanding the number of tiltrotators in their RC series.
The company confirmed that Rototilt’s R4 and R8 tiltrotators will gain counterparts in the RC series launched at Bauma last year. This means that Rototilt’s new RC System control system and the new RC Joysticks will be available to machines weighing between 10 and 43 tonnes.
The R4 tiltrotator has historically been one of Rototilt’s most popular products, according to Ekström, who has high expectations ahead of the sales launch.
He says, “We started in the mid-range but are now expanding the concept to encompass both bigger and small machines. Today we are delighted to offer increased energy efficiency and an improved driving experience for a wider range of machines and users.”
The new tiltrotator series, due to launch in February 2023, features pressure-compensated hydraulics and is said to deliver greater energy efficiency than its predecessors, in addition to enabling more controlled excavation movements.
As part of a joint initiative, Steelwrist and Rototilt have come together to set an industry standard for fully automated quick couplers under the Open-S Alliance. The non-profit organisation sets out to develop and promote the Open-S standard, with the ultimate aim of achieving global interchangeability between quick couplers, tiltrotators and work tools for excavators.
The alliance’s standardisation work has been ongoing for the last two years with the purpose to increase safety and efficiency for excavator owners, operators and ground personnel.
The partnership has started to create a uniform manufacturing standard for dimensions and tolerances as well as making it cost efficient to retrofit adaptor brackets to used and new buckets and work tools.
In 2021, Volvo Construction Equipment became the first excavator specialist to join the alliance in hopes to work with other industry partners on improving work tools for excavators. The demand for fully automatic quick couplers on excavators has continued to grow rapidly in general construction and it is said that all partners are seeing opportunities for growth in a variety of sectors.
Steelwrist and Rototilt are paving the way for the future of tiltrotators, in addition to the likes of Volvo Construction Equipment and Caterpillar. Scandinavia needs no convincing evidence of the advantages of tiltrotators and it seems the rest of Europe is taking a particular interest in increasing efficiency.
Last year, Caterpillar Work Tools Division announced new Tilt Rotate System (TRS) models for Cat 302.7 through 310 Next Generation Mini Excavators.
The new TRS4 and TRS8 S45 plus updated TRS6 models allow attached work tools to rotate 360 degrees and tilt 40 degrees side-to-side. This enables the machine to reach more work areas from a single position, while manoeuvring tools over, under, and around obstructions when excavating, grading ditches, sorting recycled materials, or placing pipe.
The new TRS models are said to multiply the mini excavator’s versatility and are available in various configurations to match the application.
The TRS6 and TRS8 feature a standard TRSAux2 auxiliary port at the bottom to connect a variety for different hydraulic tools whilst the compact design of the TRS4, TRS6 and TRS8 allows the mini excavator to maintain high digging forces.
TRS4 models are designed for efficient use by the 302.7, 303, 303.5 and 304 Mini Excavators, while the TRS6 models are compatible with the 305.5CR and 306 CR models. The TRS8 models are designed for use with the 307.5, 308, 308.5, 309 and 310.
Engcon is seeing “stable profitability” after reporting record-high net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022.
While the last three months of 2022 saw the company’s order intake decline by 29% SEK553 million (€49.4 million), its net sales increased to SEK541 million (€48.3 million).
This is up 46% on the SEK370 million (€33 million) the company brought in for the same period in 2021 - with operating profits also up 57% on the previous year to SEK 121 million (€10.8 million).
Overall, this resulted in a fourth quarter profit rise of 20%, to SEK 90 million ($8.6 million), up from SEK75 million (€6.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Engcon’s fourth quarter results meant that for the whole of 2022 the company saw an order intake rise of 1%, up from SEK1.96 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.97 billion (€171.4 million).
2022 net sales also increased by 30%, from SEK1.48 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.93 billion ($186 million), with profits last year amounting to SEK325 million (€29.6 million) - a rise of 21%.
Krister Blomgren, Engcon’s CEO, said, “Combined with increased economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rates, this led to an expected downturn in Nordic and European markets in the fourth quarter compared with exceptional comparative figures. Despite this, the order intake was at a high level when seen from a long-term perspective.
“It is worth noting that there was a break in the trend in 2022, with growth markets recording higher order intake than the Nordic region for the first time.”
Looking to the future, Engcon plans to continue investing in its third generation tiltrotator system and expand its sales network.

17 May 2023,Vermeer opens Global Parts Distribution Center,"Vermeer announced the opening of a new 312,000-sq.-ft. Global Parts Distribution Center, located on the campus of its Pella, Iowa, corporate headquarters. The facility will package and ship parts to customers and dealers worldwide.
The Global Parts Distribution Center is located at the end of what was once an old runway used by company founder Gary Vermeer to deliver parts by plane. Its placement within the corporate headquarters campus will allow it to leverage the manufacturing capabilities of the “Vermeer mile,” where most of the company’s products are assembled.
“Vermeer is focused on optimizing this facility so we can most efficiently deliver the right part at the right time to our customers. This facility allows customer support, engineering, procurement and logistics to be co-located. They work in conjunction with our operational team members to make sure we fulfill customer and dealer expectations daily,” said Tony Briggs, vice president of the Vermeer Lifecycle product group.
He noted that nearly one-third of the warehouse is filled with parts manufactured by the various plants located along the Vermeer mile. “It is very convenient for us to be located near the manufacturing facilities that supply those parts. Ultimately, we bundle the Vermeer-manufactured parts with other parts and ship the orders around the world to take care of our customers,” said Briggs.
The new Global Parts Distribution Center includes three times more space than the previous building, plus includes 23 dock doors, a warehouse management system and improved warehouse technology.
Its opening follows an earlier announcement by Vermeer of the expansion of its parts manufacturing footprint at its facility in Des Moines, Iowa, where horizontal directional drill tooling and utility tractor attachments are manufactured."
17 May 2023,Wacker Neuson celebrates 175th global anniversary,"On Monday, May 15, 2023, Wacker Neuson employees globally commemorated the company’s 175th anniversary. Its 6000 employees marked the celebration through a global call hosted by the company’s headquarters in Munich, Germany.
The company’s foundation was laid in 1848 when Johann Christian Wacker set up a blacksmith shop in Dresden, Germany. Early innovations from the company included the introduction of an electric rammer by Hermann Wacker in 1930, and the development of an internal vibrator for concrete consolidation in 1934, as well as a reversible plate for soil compaction.
Over 200 patents and utility models followed. In more recent years, Wacker Neuson has expanded into other equipment forms, including the addition of an all-new skid-steer and compact track loader line to the North American market in 2014, and later the Dual View Dumper for jobsite material handling. That same year, the company introduced two battery-powered rammers and the WL20e battery-powered wheel loader in Europe.
Today, the company’s products include an extensive line of battery-powered, zero-emission compaction and concrete consolidation products powered by the Battery One modular battery system. Future introductions in North America will include the EZ17e zero-emission mini excavator and battery-powered wheel loaders, dumpers and telehandlers.
“Taking the time to celebrate 175 years of quality and innovation reflects the commitment of our company to the many dedicated Wacker Neuson employees who have contributed to our global success throughout our history and those that are now leading us into a bright future,” said Gert Reichetseder, President and CEO, Wacker Neuson America Corporation.
“We originated the compaction industry and that will always be at the heart of Wacker Neuson, even as we grow our product offering into exciting new areas.”"
16 May 2023,Why America is ready for electric construction equipment,"
North America is ready for electric construction equipment, contrary to perceptions in some quarters that appetite for the machines lags that in Europe.
That’s according to Stephen Roy, president of Volvo Construction Equipment, Americas, speaking to International Construction.
Roy said he was seeing pockets of demand for electric machines across the USA, and that it wasn’t just their lower carbon emissions that was generating interest but the lower levels of noise and vibration.
When asked if electrically powered machines were likely to prove less popular in the North American market than in Europe, Roy said, “There are parts of the European market that are more progressive than other parts of the European market, so it’s not even the same in Europe and I think it’s the same here.
“We have states with high population density and when you go further towards the West Coast you get a lot more focus on environmental standards and more early adopters.”
Roy said he saw the trend to electrically powered machines continuing in the compact equipment market but also moving into the mid-range. Volvo is already piloting its first larger electrified excavator, the 22t EC230 in markets including Finland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, and the machine is now making its way to North America.
“We have customers that are already ready to demo and get familiar with it and then we’ll start production for North America next year,” Roy said. “For the larger machines we see some alternative power solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen combustion engines”. The company already displayed a 30t prototype hydrogen fuel cell articulated hauler at ConExpo 2023 earlier this year.
Roy also highlighted the fact that certain customers are interested in the lower levels of noise and vibration that electric machines can offer, rather than just their sustainability credentials.
“It’s not just about emissions. A lot of our customers are really excited about low noise and no vibrations, which can lead to improved operator conditions and also improved safety. We didn’t lead with that but we are finding that it’s just as important and creates new opportunities,” he said.
And he pointed to some unusual examples of where electric machines have proved a success in North America. “We’ve sold compact machines in areas that I would never have thought we’d sell them.
“We laugh about this but the Toronto Zoo needed machines to work at the same time that the buffalos were there but the noise from diesel machines scared them away. We also have an example of a school system that wanted to do some repairs as they are expanding a facility but the work was right next to a classroom and so again the electric machine was more suitable because it was lower noise.”
Roy said that the shift Volvo anticipated taking place in the market meant that competencies among its own workforce also had to change. “We’ve had to go out and search for people that have backgrounds in software and electrical engineering. It’s definitely a new ballgame but it’s a positive in that it’s bringing people into Volvo that maybe wouldn’t have considered it before. Electric and sustainable power brings a whole new generation of people who want to be part of this transformation.”
Meanwhile, Roy, who is set to become president of Volvo-owned Mack Trucks next month, said that machine control technology in construction equipment “continues to get better and more sophisticated”.
He highlighted Volvo’s Dig Assist platform. “We now have a process where you can have an expert operator dig a hole for a certain application. So maybe you were putting in a culvert in a subdivision and you need to dig the hole in the same way. An expert can go out and dig it to the parameters that we need, save the file and transfer it to another excavator. And that excavator operator can now benefit from the best practice of the first, experienced operator.”
And he pointed to the growing capabilities of Volvo’s remote-controlled machines and its productivity tools.
The OEM recently handed over a remote-controlled EC250 excavator to a customer in South Dakota who works installing pipes in a water sewer.
He also noted that Volvo has the capability to retrofit non-Volvo machines and link them into Volvo’s Connected Maps feature, which allows a visual overview in real time of the position and movement of every machine, vehicle and visitor to site.

10 May 2023,Develon launches new 6-tonne Stage V mini-excavators,"

Develon has launched the new DX62R-7 and DX63-7 6 tonne Stage V mini-excavators with a new shared global styling design.
The new mini-excavators are designed to offer maximum performance, optimum stability, increased versatility, enhanced operator comfort, controllability, durability, ease of maintenance and serviceability.

Both models are powered by the new D24 Stage V compliant diesel engine providing 44.3 kW (59.4 HP) of power. Develon says that despite offering an 8% increased torque of 26.5 kgm/rpm, the D24 engine still provides a 7% decrease in engine fuel consumption.


Moreover, the DX62R-7 and DX63-7 employ a Load Sensing System that operates on a new Main Control Valve. The mechanism enables a longer spool stroke, thereby enhancing controllability and work efficiency/performance in comparison to the previous models.
Both machines provide an auxiliary flow of 90 litres per minute, which improves the efficiency of work with attachments. The flow capacity can be easily monitored on the Develon Smart 8-inch touch screen in 10 increments and can be controlled using the thumbwheel located on the joystick.




The new cab on the DX62R-7 and DX63-7 features a full glass entry door to maximise operator visibility on this side of the machine from inside the cab. A rear-view camera is optional and the high luminance LED work lamps (which are standard) on the cab further enhance visibility and safety.








The mini-excavators include the latest Develon Fleet Management TMS 3.0 Cellular system installed as standard, which provides a telematics management system for the excavators, by collecting data from sensors on the machines."
09 May 2023,‘Significant’ Q1 growth for Wacker Neuson Group,"But the company admitted that it does not expect to improve on these figures during the rest of the year.
The Germany-based company’s revenue climbed by almost 28% year-on-year to €667.2 million, while EBIT (earnings before interest and taxation) – aided by a one-off sale of fixed assets – more than doubled to €87.8 million.
The EBIT margin of 13.2% was also considerably higher than the 7.5% achieved in 2022.
“As anticipated in our annual guidance, we have carried the full momentum from previous quarters into the new fiscal year and continued to grow significantly,” said Dr Karl Tragl, chairman of the executive board and CEO of the Wacker Neuson Group.
“At the same time, we continue to expect the first quarter to also be the strongest of 2023.” r
As in previous quarters, all three reporting regions contributed to growth in the first quarter with big increases.
In the Europe (EMEA) region, revenue rose by 22.4% €504 million compared to €411.6 million in 2022, with particularly positive growth in Germany.
On the product side, demand for excavators, wheeled loaders and telehandler increased noticeably.
The Americas region grew by 57% to €142.6 million, with a particular sharp year-on-year increase in the USA and further growth in Canada and South American markets.
Asia-Pacific region posted a lesser increase, by 7.3% to €20.6 million, driven primarily by the Australian market with products adapted to the needs of the local market and the focus on independent rental companies continuing to generate strong demand.
By contrast, the Chinese market continued to prove difficult and declined in the first quarter.
Speaking on supply chains after the group’s net working capital ratio fell from 31.9% to 30%, CFO Christian Burkhard said: “We are are still a long way from a normalisation of the situation.
“However, the continued increase in inventory levels paid off in the first quarter as we systematically exploited our growth opportunities. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that effective working capital management remains at the top of our agenda.”"
04 May 2023,Back to the future at Metso as Outotec dropped from company name,"Metso merged with Outotec in the summer of 2020 and the combined business has since acquired companies including Tesab and McCloskey International.
Yesterday, the sustainable technology specialist announced operating profits of €197 million (US$217 million) for the first quarter of 2023 after a 22% year-on-year increase in sales revenue.
Metso Outotec’s Executive Team has been renamed as the Metso Leadership Team.
“After the successful integration of Metso and Outotec, we will focus on growing a strong unified Metso company and brand,” said president and CEO of Metso, Pekka Vauramo.
“We have combined two valuable companies into one strong Metso.
“Our focus is clear: we continue enabling sustainable modern life and transforming the industry with a clear strategy and strong culture, supported by a name that is short yet established and well recognised among all our stakeholders.
“Services are an extremely important part of our business, requiring a strong name.”.
The company said that Outotec continues as a product brand and carries significant value as the name of some key technologies and products.
The change of the parent company name to Metso Corporation is effective from today, but globally the change will be implemented in a phased manner."
02 May 2023,7 things we learned from Caterpillar’s latest trading update,"

Last week saw Caterpillar unveil a strong performance for the first quarter of 2023, driven in large part by growth in North America.
Sales in its construction industries division increased by 10% to US$6.7 billion, while operating margin in the segment was 26.5%.
Here’s seven things we learned about Caterpillar’s performance, what it says about the wider construction industry, and where it could be heading:

Caterpillar reported better equipment availability thanks to improving supply chain conditions. But “pockets of challenge” still remain, particularly for large engines which could impact some of its larger machines.
In general, the supply chain improvements meant that Caterpillar was able to make stronger-than-expected shipments in North America, which is Caterpillar’s most constrained region as far as dealer inventory is concerned.
Caterpillar noted that there is now improved availability of its excavators. That has come about as a result not just of the lower pressure on supply chains but also because of a slowing of demand in China.
Caterpillar said it expected China’s above 10t excavator industry to remain below 2022 levels this year due to low construction activity, while its sales in China would be below the typical range of 5-10% of total Caterpillar sales in 2023.
The better availability of some types of machine in turn means that Caterpillar expects dealers to scale back their levels of inventory in the second half of the year, even though overall demand remains healthy.
The second half of 2022 saw dealers build their inventories to the tune of $1.4 billion. Talking to analysts, Caterpillar chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby said, “We are not planning for this trend to repeat [in the second half of 2023]. Instead, we expect to see dealers decrease inventories compared to the first quarter levels and end 2023 about flat relative to the end of 2022.”
Caterpillar’s overall adjusted operating profit margin for the period was 21.1% and hit 26.5% in the construction industries division. In a call with analysts, chief financial officer Andrew Bonfield explained that while Cat’s manufacturing costs did increase, they increased by less than the company anticipated.
Better-than-expected sales volumes meant factories could operate more efficiently, while freight costs were also lower. Meanwhile, the average price Caterpillar was able to charge for machines was higher than it had expected. These factors combined to boost the company’s profit margins.
But Bonfield said he did not expect the favourable effects of absorbing costs to last in the second half of the year, with margins in the remaining quarters of the year expected to be lower than the first quarter as the relationship between price and manufacturing costs normalized.
The US government has pledged to pump billions of dollars into infrastructure investments through measures such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BiL), which it is claimed involves up to $550 billion in new spending.
Umpleby confirmed that Caterpillar had started to see the positive impact of those infrastructure dollars in orders.
Speaking to analysts, he said, “The projects that don’t require a lot of permitting, things like resurfacing roads, have already started and we’re seeing the positive benefit of that.
“When customers believe there’s a pipeline of projects coming, they’re more likely typically to make that capital investment, to make a purchase of a new piece of equipment. It has started and we expect it to continue for some time.”
Caterpillar said it expected business activity in Europe, Middle East and Africa to increase in 2023 as compared to 2022. While that was down in large part to particularly strong construction demand in the Middle East, and while uncertain economic conditions remain, the company noted that European construction was “more resilient than we previously anticipated”.
When it came to mining equipment, Umpleby said he expected healthy demand, driven by the transition to new forms of energy. He noted that commodity prices remain above investment thresholds and said he expected production utilization levels to remain elevated.
He added, “We also expect the aging of the fleet and a lower level of parked trucks to support future demand for our equipment and services. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for profitable growth.”

02 May 2023,New 120 tonne XCMG AT crane for Europe,"



Chinese manufacturer XCMG has a new 120 tonne capacity all terrain crane for sale in Europe.
XCMG said the 120 tonne rating is calculated at 2.5 metres radius. At 3 metres the crane lifts 80 tonnes.
The XCA120 E on its four axle carrier has a 66 metre boom in six sections. An 11.65 to 18.5 metre, offsetable bi-fold swingaway jib can be added. Putting a pair of 7.1 metre lattice extensions in between the end of the boom and the swingaway gives a maximum tip height just beyond 96 metres. Maximum working radius is given as 60 metres.
An MTU diesel engine powers both the carrier and the crane upper. It has a ZF TraXon transmission with 12 forward speeds, driving the three rearmost axles. A retarder is also standard as is all wheel steering. XCMG said it has independent suspension “similar in overall concept to that used by Grove.”
Depending on tyre choice the crane’s overall width can be kept down to 2.75 metres. Overall length is given as being just over 14.3 metres.
Including their fully retracted position, the outriggers can be set at five spread widths: 3.83, 5, 5.9, and 7 metres. Maximum total counterweight is 33 tonnes, made up from eight slabs to allow multiple configurations.
June sees the official unveiling of the XCA120 E at the JDL Expo crane, transport and aerial work platform show in Beaune, France.

26 April 2023,Haulotte posts ‘historic’ revenues across the board,"France-based lift manufacturer Haulotte has reported “historic consolidated revenues” for the first quarter of 2023, amounting to €196.3 million (US$213.5 million).
The figure represents a 43% increase on the €135.8 million ($150 million) it achieved for the same period in 2022, and keeps the company on track to achieve its predicted 20% growth for 2023.
“All of the Group’s activities showed an increase compared with Q1 2022,” said Haulotte. “The sale of equipment is up by +48%, the rental business by +7% and finally the service business by +15%.”
These percentages equate to respective 2023 revenues of €172.6 million ($190.6 million), €5.8 million ($6.4 million) and €17.9 million ($19.7 million).

While the prediction takes into account a strong historic order book, the company describes the aerial platform market as “dynamic” and says that pressure on the components supply chain is continuing to ease.
Regionally, the company saw the biggest growth in North America, where the uptake of aerial platforms is continuing to rise.
“Haulotte confirmed the results seen in previous publications and posted growth of +72% in the first quarter, largely driven by the aerial work platform business, which more than doubled compared to the same period last year.”
The Latin American and Asia-Pacific regions both saw first quarter sales grow by 38% compared to the same period last year and “In Europe, sales were up by +35% in the first quarter, driven by all markets except for Russia, which is at a standstill”.

26 April 2023,Engineering firm converts 1.6t excavator into disaster rescue robot,"

Forth Engineering, based in Cumbria in the UK, has built a remote-controlled ‘rescue robot’ designed to be sent into disaster zones and controlled remotely.
The machine is based around a 1.6t JCB compactor excavator platform.
It is tetherless and can be controlled from a safe location up to 150 metres away.
It carries a 700bar rescue tool, a grapple hook to move obstructions, a hopper to disperse sand to contain spillages, and an affixative spraying system to contain a nuclear spillage.
The robot has already been trialled at Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria and Forth is now looking it rolling it out to other plants across the UK.
Mark Telford, Forth’s managing director, said: “The Rescue Robot is a pioneering development which has already been successfully tested in hazardous environments, and it has been manufactured to offer a safe, remotely operated alternative to sending humans into disaster zones.
“By working with Sellafield Ltd, we were able to prove the machine is able to withstand some particularly dangerous conditions, and its various adaptations and capabilities mean that this will be a real asset to the UK’s nuclear industry.
“There are endless amounts of modifications and end effectors which can be included on the robot, and we are excited to be able to provide a product which will make working in nuclear plants across the country much safer, while also saving industry a substantial amount of money.”
“Sellafield Ltd required the development of a 1.6 tonne robot, but we are able to adapt the product to any size and also fit it with any type of tools or end effectors to fit the nature of the project.
“What is extremely exciting to us is that it can also be adapted to work in any industry, and it is a real game changer in reaching some of the most dangerous environments found in sites across the UK.”"
25 April 2023,Online exclusive: Rokbak investigates electric and hydrogen-powered articulated trucks,"The idea of articulated trucks that can carry a payload of 30 tonnes being powered by electric power might seem far fetched but it is a possibility that the company Rokbak is looking into. Paul Douglas, Managing Director of the articulated truck company – which is part of the Volvo group – says that they are investigating all possibilities.

“Our trucks will have to be zero emissions somehow. The question is: what does that look like?” comments Douglas. “Electrification using battery technology that you can see today is a stretch for these big products because these are big power demand for long hours of usage.”
As Douglas says, electric power probably isn’t the best source for trucks due to how large they are and their work cycles – it isn’t uncommon for trucks to be run for 20 or 22 hours a day. “We are looking at hydrogen internal combustion engine and fuel cells to provide the electricity using hydrogen. These are technologies that Volvo is working with on their own highway truck and bus solutions.”
Douglas is originally an engineer and the challenges of cutting emissions and alternative power sources clearly excites him. He makes the point that, with technology developing at a rapid rate, no one in the construction industry can confidently state what the future will hold for power.
“It is easier to electrify the smaller stuff,” he says. “But there’s a lot of learning that comes from that. And you know, I can’t keep up with battery technology. It’s moving so quickly. Every six months battery capabilities seem to grow almost exponentially. I don’t know where it will all end up, but I think it’ll be a combination; some products will be batteries, some will be hydrogen fuel cells, and some will be hydrogen internal combustion.”
The last 18 months have been a boom time for both rigid and articulated haulers with numbers the highest they have been for around a decade at around 9,000 units a year. Part of this is due to pent up demand that followed the Covid-19 pandemic added to governments around the world investing in large infrastructure projects although Douglas believes that this is likely the peak of the market.
“We all felt at 8,000 units worldwide, that would be the peak. Then we said the same thing at 8,500, but now we are over 9,000 units. When I look around specific markets, we can see the slowdown coming, such as in Europe. I think we’re probably at the peak now. How long will that hold? Most of 2023 will probably level out [at current levels] although we could start to see a downturn in the second half of the year. It’s very strong at the moment, so we need to capitalise on that as much as we can.”
One of the markets that has driven this growth is North America, which Douglas says accounts for over half of Rokbak’s sales. In terms of smaller markets that have seen good growth he highlights Indonesia and the UK where the HS2 high-speed train project has played a key role in generating demand.
The brand of Rokbak has been around now for around 18 months following the name change from Terex Trucks. Douglas says that a huge effort went into this and that the response from the industry has been very positive. “The reception of it has been fantastic, first and foremost with our own dealer network because we were asking them to move from the old name to Rokbak. But they’ve gone with it, they’ve got a positive feel about it, they’ve invested into. The attraction that we’re getting from people that want to be on this journey with this, inquiries about becoming our dealer, has been really good.”
Talking about the dealer network, the change that we spoke about at the start of this article, from diesel powered trucks to alternative powered trucks, will impact dealers in more ways than one. First, they will be selling a different product and secondly there are different demands and opportunities with this.
“Your dealer partners, the people that sell and support the product – this is going to be a new adventure for them as well,” he says. “It’s new technology for them. An electric drive product probably gets less wear parts, less servicing and spares opportunity. That’s going be a real challenge for the traditional dealer. Their business model’s going to have to evolve.”
Equipment manufacturers have reduced emissions to meet different standards around the world and are now investing heavily into the R&D of alternative power sources, all while juggling issues such as rising inflation and a lack of skilled workers. It is a challenge, but Douglas gives off the sense that he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Moving into this new technology, new manufacturing processes are going to be required, new dealer models. There’s a real change, you can feel it in the air,” he says, pausing for breath before adding with a smile, “It’s fascinating.”"
24 April 2023,APEX 2023: a guide to what’s new at Maastricht show,"Unsurprisingly, green energy and digitization will be two focuses of the world’s largest dedicated exhibition for access equipment, taking place in June this year. Manufacturers will be out in force and here follows just a few examples of those.
Dinolift will be addressing all these, alongside electrification and sustainably, by promoting its MyDino telematics software at the show that will partly be demonstrated via mobile phone and tablet.
MyDino comes standard on all units, including the 280 RXTE lightweight boom lift pictured here, introduced from January.
The Finish manufacturer is also supporting the European green target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, with its the lithium version of its 280 RXTE model, launched last year.
Also, there will be the 23m working height 230 VTH chassis mounted unit, while trailer mounts will be represented by the 160XTB II.
Faresin will attend APEX for the first time and present the 6.26 Full Electric and 17.45 Classic 55 telehandlers.
Electrification will be one of the most important themes on the Faresin stand. The 6.26 Full Electric was launched in 2018 as the first electric telehandler in the world and has since then gone on to considerable success and updated versions.
Designed to be agile, quiet and sustainable, the 6.26 has a 2.6 tonne lifting capacity and a maximum height reach of 6m.
Created as a twin to the diesel-powered version, the full electric unit is suited to construction sites at night, zero-emission residential areas, livestock farms, greenhouses and food handling areas, such as cold rooms, wine cellars and food laboratories.
The 17.45 Classic 55 of the Big Range is created for greater heights, with a three-section boom for a maximum lifting height of 17 meters and a maximum load capacity of 4.5 tonnes.
XCMG will display eight models, including electric telescopic units and an electric 18m rough terrain scissor lift, among others.
It is worth mentioning that the XG1823ERT RT scissor and XGS28ACK telescopic boom are being introduced to Europe for the first time.
The electric XG1823ERT has a maximum working height of 18m with a large rated load of 700kg. The also electric XGS28ACK has a capacity of 460kg and the maximum operating height of 28.8m.
The telescopic XGS58E1 will also be at the exhibition. The super-large 58.6m working height model with 24.8m outreach, is a newly upgraded version of the pre-existing model of the same name. It has a 230kg/450kg dual load capacity.

19 April 2023,Small but mighty: The role of mini and midi excavators in modern projects,"Many manufacturers in the construction industry, certainly the larger ones, have expansive product ranges. One of the reasons for this is financial – the more products a company can sell and service the more money can be made – but another one is simple necessity; construction is such a broad industry that it requires a wide selection of equipment.
Out of all the equipment that is used in construction it is difficult to think of one that has grown in popularity quite as quickly as compact excavators such as the mini excavator (machines approximately 0-6 tonnes) and the midi (approximately 6-10 tonnes).
“The first mini excavators were produced in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a tool of necessity in the country’s famously dense and crowded cities,” explains Chris Sleight, managing director, Off-Highway Research. “By the 1980s they were being exported to Europe and North America, but it was not until the early 1990s when Japanese asset prices collapsed and the economy stagnated that these overseas markets became much more important to the sector’s (still predominantly) Japanese suppliers.”
By the late 1990s, Europe had overtaken Japan as the world’s largest mini excavator market, while demand in North America was matching that of Japan by the mid-2000s. However, it was not until around 15 years ago that the popularity of mini excavators became truly established.
“The previous peak in sales was in 2007, just prior to the impacts of the Lehman Bros. collapse and global economic crisis. That year saw just under 185,000 mini excavators sold worldwide. Fast forward to 2021, the latest peak in the mini excavator cycle, and more than 325,000 units were sold,” says Sleight.
Two key factors have driven this growth: compact excavators have increasingly replaced traditional machine types like the backhoe loader in Europe and North America thanks to the attraction of a smaller footprint, full 360-degree slewing and lower prices than backhoe loaders; they have also started to sell in significant numbers in emerging countries. The most notable has been China, where the mini excavator market peaked at more than 100,000 machines sold in 2020.
Timur Abied, utility product manager at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) tells International Construction that mini and midi excavators are among the OEMs fastest growing product segments with more efficient governance of energy being a main driver.
This sentiment is backed up by Cédric Durand, product management director EMEA, Yanmar Compact Equipment, who says that mini and midi excavators have been growing strongly over the past years.
He adds that, “From one year to another the growth can differ from one country to the other but almost all countries had a strong growth.”
Another smaller factor – but still important – behind the growth in the popularity of these machines is the increased use of attachments such as tiltrotators. “The growing popularity of tiltrotators has been a gamechanger for compact excavators, as tiltrotators allow an excavator operator to tilt and twirl an attachment 360 degrees,” says David Caldwell, national product manager, Takeuchi-US.
New technology is increasingly being integrated into mini and midi excavators, often from what was originally reserved for larger models. Stephane Dieu, excavators product manager, Europe, Develon (previously Doosan), says that, “With the arrival of our DX-7 range, all of the new mini excavators in the range are now equipped with our DoosanConnect telematics system, which was restricted in the past to only our medium and heavy segments – 14 tonne and over in the excavators. This gives our customers the opportunity to fully monitor their compact fleet.”
Chris Bardas, product manager, Hitachi Construction Machinery, reveals that the OEM’s latest mini and compact excavator are, “equipped with ICT solutions, safety features such as rear- and side-view cameras, and benefit from the Zaxis-6 cab, which is renowned for being highly comfortable and spacious, with an ergonomic seat and user-friendly controls.”
Wacker Neuson’s Klaus Allerstorfer, product manager, excavators, agrees that, increasingly, features are being added to mini and midi excavators that in the past were only for bigger models.
“Overall, more and more features are now being integrated into smaller models that were previously only used in larger models,” he explains.
“By features, I don’t just mean hardware, but also digital and data-driven solutions. One example is our EquipCare telematics solution, which makes it easier for our customers to manage their fleets and keep track of the condition of their machines.”
Electric powered equipment is a major trend in construction, especially in compact machines such as mini and midi excavators which many believe are more suited to this type of power than larger machines.
As is the case with many OEMs, Hitachi Construction Machinery has recently launched new electric models in this segment (ZX55U-6EB mini and ZX85-6EB compact) as has Takeuchi, with the all-electric TB20e.
Caterpillar, the world’s largest OEM, announced last year that its construction industries division was working on four new electric equipment machines, including the 301.9 Electric Mini Excavator powered by a Cat 48V, 32kWh battery with a run time of up to eight hours on a single charge.
Another new electric model is Bobcat’s 2-tonne mini-excavator the E19e – an electric version of the E19 internal-combustion model. It offers zero emissions, low-noise operation and comparable levels of performance to its diesel-powered counterpart.
The Bobcat E19e features the same profile and external dimensions. It features a 3.5-hour battery capacity and can be recharged quickly using a super-fast charger, meaning that, by topping up the power during work breaks, the machine can be used all day for the majority of typical applications.
Scott Park, Doosan Bobcat CEO, commented, “With the introduction of the E19e, Bobcat has expanded its larger-size electric line-up of zero emission and quiet machines that can match the excellent performance of our conventional models.”
Volvo CE has been at the centre of the development of electric powered construction equipment, with the OEM introducing its first electric compact models back in 2019 and now offering three compact electric excavators and two compact wheeled loaders. Volvo CE’s Abied says that the company are not just looking at compact equipment though, adding that, “While we started with electric mini excavators, we have also grown into the development of mid-size solutions such as our EC230 Electric excavator.”
While larger excavators may be increasingly electrified in the future, the focus is clearly on compact equipment such as mini and midi excavators.
A key point that OEMs make is that, as well as the benefits of electric power such as no emissions, no noise, no vibrations (thus a more comfortable environment for the operator), one thing is key: performance is just as good, if not better, than with diesel models.
Bardas from Hitachi sums it up by saying, “One of the main advantages of our zero-emission mini and compact excavators, the ZX55U-6EB and ZX85U-6EB, is the high level of performance they provide. No compromises have been made in terms of performance and they have been designed to provide similar levels of performance as diesel alternatives. The fact that they are zero-emission and quieter than diesel models are additional benefits.”
Despite all of the benefits that electric power brings, there are also challenges. Arguably the biggest one is the bottom line. To put it simply, electric machines are considerably more expensive than their diesel counterparts.
“When it comes to battery-powered solutions, the purchase price can be a hurdle,” admits Allerstorfer from Wacker Neuson. “But if you look at the total cost of ownership, the e-machines score with very low maintenance and operating costs, which in turn convinces many customers. In addition, we have found that renting the machines can help to quickly overcome initial doubts.”
Durand from Yanmar agrees that the higher cost is putting off some, but also makes the point that the total cost of ownership over the life of the machine can be less. “Indeed, the purchase cost is still higher than with traditional ICE machines. In the long run this price premium should decrease, and we are looking into the total cost of ownership as well which, at the end, is certainly the best criteria for profitability,” he says.
Another issue is undoubtably with charging and infrastructure. If construction is taking place on a remote site and not in a city then there may not be a power source to charge the battery. At the moment there are no universal standards regarding charging hardware and protocols.
“The lack of charging infrastructure and the still slower pace of introduction is a challenge and we need all stakeholders to help deliver the ecosystem required to support our electric machines and, in doing so, together achieve the strategic objectives of the Paris Agreement,” says Volvo CE’s Abied.
“High energy costs and the lack of financial and legal incentives also hamper deployment of strategic initiatives supporting electric power as the competitive solution for mini and midi excavators.”
When it comes to charging solutions increasing numbers of companies are producing fast charging options and there are other options, such as Wacker Neuson’s ‘charging box’.
“We are not only focusing on the development of zero emission products, but are also looking at entire construction site solutions,” says Allerstorfer.
“We will soon be launching our Charging Box, a mobile power bank for the construction site. This will enable customers to charge their zero emission products easily – and above all independently from local power sources.”
While electric mini and midi excavators are growing in popularity, the number of models sold are very small compared to diesel models. So, what’s next for these diesel models? More new technology being integrated into them that makes the life of an operator easier, and was previously reserved for larger machines, is one trend that will continue.
“These newer technological features all have one thing in common – they’re designed to help operators stay comfortable and more productive,” says Caldwell from Takeuchi US.
“They also help ensure that operators know exactly how their machines are performing by providing a great deal of information at their fingertips.”
In Wacker Neuson’s newest excavator, the wheeled EW100, Allerstorfer says that, “Digitisation played a major role in the development of this machine. For example, we have implemented an intelligent attachment management, a state-of-the-art Human-Machine-Interface, and the preparation for various assistance systems for process optimisation.”
Regarding sales around the world, mini and midi excavators are expected to continue to see strong numbers, if perhaps not at the same levels as in recent years.
Mini excavators are machines which replace manual labour. With the economic driver of rising labour costs (plus the difficulty in finding workers ) added to the fact that the purchase cost for these machines is cheaper than ever, adoption will continue.
“Drivers like these are at play in emerging markets, and the large-scale mini excavator industry which has sprung up in China means that machines are more affordable now than they were before,” says Off Highway Research’s Sleight. “This will help drive the adoption of this type of compact equipment around the world in the years to come.”
It will be interesting to see just what technology and power sources these mini and midi excavators of the future are equipped with as standard."
19 April 2023,"Second 3,000 tonne capacity Huisman giant crane for Havfram","
Havfram Wind has ordered its second 3,000 tonnes-plus capacity Huisman crane for offshore wind turbine installation.
Dutch crane and heavy engineering specialist Huisman will supply the Norwegian installation contractor with the giant leg encircling crane (LEC). Installation will be on the second new NG-20000X wind turbine installation vessel. This order follows the first, placed in mid-December 2022, for an identical crane which was the 13th LEC order for Huisman since 2021.
At the same time, Havfram ordered the second new NG-20000X vessel, on which the crane will be installed, from CIMC Raffles in China. It is designed by GustoMSC in the Netherlands and CIMC Raffles. The new vessels with their 3,000 tonne LECs will be able to install turbines with rotors up to 300 metres in diameter and monopile foundations weighing 3,000 tonnes to a water depth of 70 metres.
Huisman’s fully electric LECs for Havfram will have 155 metre booms and a lifting height around 180 metres above the deck. It is designed to be lightweight and reliable, with high positioning accuracy and energy efficiency in operation. Deck space is maximised by the short tail swing design. Its segmented slew bearing is designed for easy inspection and maintenance.
Speaking about the latest order David Roodenburg, Huisman CEO, said, “We are grateful that Havfram have placed their trust in us to also equip their second innovative new build vessel with a Huisman crane. They are constructing some of the world’s most energy efficient, hybrid-powered wind turbine installation vessels. We are proud that with the two crane orders, we can contribute to boosting wind energy production as well as further improving energy efficiency to reduce Havfram’s carbon footprint.”
Commenting on his choice of crane Håkon Johannessen, Havfram Wind engineering manager, said, “We are pleased to have Huisman supplying cranes for our newbuild wind turbine installation vessels. Huisman’s track record and willingness to tailor their already proven leg encircling crane design to fit the requirements of Havfram and the market has been key to ensuring we have the right tool for the tasks that lie ahead.”
Like the first unit this second crane will be built at the Huisman factory in Zhangzhou, China.

17 April 2023,IRE 2023: what equipment will be on show?,"Since the last edition of the International Rental Exhibition (IRE), it would be an understatement to say that plenty of innovation has taken place among manufacturers, driven by the demand for compact equipment, alternative power and environmentally friendly solutions.
The show will bring an array of those OEMs together under one roof to display just some of the latest launches and developments in construction equipment and technology, as well as aerial platforms through the APEX show, which is being held in conjunction with IRE.
With a wide range of equipment on show - more than 200 companies combined are exhibiting at IRE and APEX - here is a preview of what visitors can expect to see at IRE 2023.
The role of sustainability and low-emission equipment has continued to increase in recent years, and that theme will be highlighted at IRE as Sany will show the electrically driven SY19E mini excavator.
The machine, which the company says delivers zero pollutant emissions and significantly lower noise levels, comes with an electric motor that delivers a peak output of 15kW and an accumulator pack that lasts for an entire working day on one battery charge.
Charging the machine is made possible with a fast-charging station via DC in 1.5 hours, at a public AC charging station in 2.5 hours or overnight at a 220V socket.
Case Construction will highlight its CX15 EV 1.3 tonne mini excavator. Powered by a 16kW electric motor, the machine features retractable tracks that reduces machine width to 790mm and a load-sensing hydraulic system that is said to allow the operator to dial the machine into each task.
The 21.5kWh lithium-ion battery is charged either by the 110V/220V on-board charger or via an external rapid charger that can fully charge the machine in 90 minutes and can last up to an entire working day depending on the work, while its minimum swing radius design is said to make working close to structures and obstacles easier.
From its range of electric and low-emission machines, Yanmar will display several future-ready machines at IRE.
First up is the SV17e electric mini excavator prototype. Designed for the 1.5 to 2.0 tonnes segment, the unit is powered by an all-electric drive and has an open-centre hydraulic system with load-sensing hydraulic pump.
The SV17e delivers 23.5kWh gross electric power, while its 48V air-cooled motors provides “impressive digging, lifting and carrying capabilities,” according to Yanmar.
Another Yanmar prototype on show will be the V8e electric compact wheel loader with 40kWh battery capacity, hydrostatic drive and high-lifting capabilities.
The machine has an 800l loading bucket, 11kW charging in standard configuration and 22kW in optional fast charging.
Joining the SV17e and V8e is the C08e tracked carrier and ViO33 zero tail swing excavator.
With an 11.5kWh battery and a power capacity of 24V, Yanmar says the compact C08e has the “ultimate power and manoeuvrability to excel in tight spaces,” while the ViO33 is said to offer “true zero tail swing” and an “ultra-quiet and efficient engine” designed with low emissions in mind.
Launched in 2020, the eDingo 500 electric compact utility loader from Toro will make its European tradeshow debut at IRE having undergone several upgrades over the last three year’s.
An electric version of the Dingo 323, the machine produces zero engine-exhaust emissions and less noise thanks to its HyperCell Power System, a new lithium-ion battery system developed by Toro.
On its stand, Tobrocco Giant will show its latest line of electric loaders with the G2700E X-TRA, which is an electrically driven version of the powerful G2700 diesel series, and the G2200E X-TRA.
Both loaders are equipped with an 48V LPT-battery and have a pulling force of 12.500N. Optionally the battery can be charged at a car charging station. Said to be ideal for rental, the machine is described by the company as compact and easyily transportable.
Elsewhere on its stand, the company will show its GP1950E electric vibratory plate and the GR740E vibratory rammer.
JCB will show its latest innovations in zero-emissions technology and demonstrate its role in the move towards a cleaner, low-emission future for construction and rental equipment with its growing range of JCB E-TECH electric machinery.
The JCB 19C-1E - the world’s first electric mini excavator will take centre stage, the company say.
The machine is said to produce zero exhaust emissions at point of use and is “considerably quieter” than a standard machine.
Four lithium-ion batteries provide 20kWh of energy storage – enough for full working shift for many mini excavator customers on a single charge.
Also new will be a 2 tonne capacity E2000 electric site dumper from HG Machines in Denmark. This machine follows on from the ultra-compact 1 tonne capacity machines launched by the company in 2016. See more on this machine here.
The newly launched Archy rental platform from Gorman-Rupp Europe will be officially launched into the international market at IRE.
The platform aims to deliver “faster, easier and more reliable” pump rental by using a 10-step pump selector that can advise which pump is needed for specific projects.
It then suggests which pump will be ideal for the user and details how to reserve, rent and manage the pumps as well as all the rental pricing.
Gorman-Rupp say 100s of pumps will be available on the tool, including booster pumps, centrifugal pumps, diaphragm pumps, high pressure centrifugal pumps, pump hoses and submersible pumps.
Another new launch on show at IRE will be the Task Manager web application from Volvo CE. The worksite management tool, which is currently available in the North American market, is designed to connect people, machines and projects to ensure activities are delivered “on target, on time and to budget,” according to Volvo CE.
Swepac will show a line-up of reversible plates it is launching as part of its Battery One concept range.
The FB200B has a 4.6kWh onboard battery, 3.0kW IPM synchronous motor, 550mm wide base plate, while the larger FB300B has a 6.6kWh onboard battery, 10.0kW IPM synchronous motor and 600mm wide base plate.
The large onboard batteries enable them to reach sufficient running time without re-charging.
Users can monitor the progress of projects, set targets, track material on sites and manage data from mixed fleets in real-time. The data collected by Task Manager is then made accessible via mobile or laptop.
Spartan Solutions will debut its PHALANX V6 software platform that aims to streamline the process of equipment rental operations.
The platform utilises artificial intelligence (AI), expert rules and statistical algorithms to identify patterns and trends in equipment’s telematics and operations data. This data includes information about the performance, operation, maintenance, and usage of a machine.
Once the data is collected, the AI engine can detect any abnormalities or issues.
Launched at Bauma 2022, the HBOX+ Hybrid lighting tower will be presented by Himoinsa.
The tower combines a battery-powered system and Stage V diesel engine that is said to reduce noise and carbon footprint while keeping the 120,000-lumen light capacity of its diesel counterpart.
The HBOX+ Hybrid includes LFP batteries (Lithium Phosphate) that have been designed for a lifetime of 6000 cycles, while also offering four different working modes.
The HBOX+ Hybrid incorporates 4 x 350W LED spotlights and an LED Dimming Control which means the tower can start-up with dimming.
Himoinsa will also demonstrate the 45/60 model (60kW/h) of its EHR battery-powered generator which comes with its HICORE System.
Described as a compact, clean product, the generator can operate as a single source of power generation for as a recharging station for electrical construction machinery, as well as allowing integration with gas and diesel generator sets.
Vistors to the Briggs & Stratton stand will be able to see its newest Vanguard battery products and engine solutions.
The products on display include the Vanguard Si 1.5kWh Swappable Battery and the new Vanguard 400 EFI /ETC Single Cylinder (pictured).
The company says it developed the cylinder by working with OEMs to provide a “tailored power solution, that caters to each OEM’s specific requirements within the rental market.”
Generac Mobile will display the VT-Solar, a generator-free lighting tower with three solar panels that can recharge its built-in battery pack.
The tower is available in two versions, a manual-mast and hydraulic-mast version, which comes with higher battery capacity, powerful solar panels (400W each) and four LED floodlights with adjustable light power.
Exhibiting alongside Generac Mobile, Pramac will display its GRW Hybrid generator, which it describes as an efficient, reliable unit that reduces operational expenditure, with a choice of available operating modes that allow the correct selection according to site specifications.
Trime will present the X-SOLAR 4x60W LED lighting tower fitted with four 60W LED lamps.
The company says it is built to be robust, with galvanised metal works, and powder coating finish.
The zero-emission tower also has optional features, including a telemetry system for remote location and operational monitoring, an automatic start-up PIR operation, and dimmable lighting.
Elsehwere, ItalTower will exhibit its Street Solar lighting tower that it launched last year.
The tower with a 60W solar panel produces 6,000 lumens and has a lithium battery pack with a capacity of 14.8V.
Paclite will display its concept edging trowel, the M600.
Powered by a Vanguard engine, the new concept 600mm machine has been developed together with Cramo Sweden and is said to be ideal for rental due to its ABS fly wheel, which ensures concrete does not stick to the trowel.
Paclite says it will launch new versions of the M900 and M600 later this year, powered by a long-lasting battery-charger & motor.
Taking place from 6-8 June, IRE will be held at the MECC centre in Maastricht, the Netherlands, alongside APEX, the European Rental Association’s (ERA) annual Convention and the European Rental Awards.

29 May 2023,Kubota unveils new excavator,"Kubota has unveiled its latest addition to its line of mini excavators with the new 8.5 tonne KX085-5.
The excavator, which is said to come with more than 20 improvements over the previous ‘dash 4’ model, is powered by a low-emission Kubota engine and can be equipped with a two-piece boom for expanded working range.
The KX085-5 includes an auto-idling system that automatically reduces the engine RPM to idling speed when the control levers are left in neutral for more than four seconds.
Kubota says the machine was designed to “ensure operators can save energy and running costs, as well as reduce noise and exhaust emissions” and boost work efficiency and increase productivity through its hydraulic mechanism that enables operators to run the arm, boom, bucket, and swivel simultaneously.
Other features include two auxiliary circuits with adjustable maximum oil flow, load sensing hydraulic system, float function, auto-shift system, a redesigned cab with wider entry point and floor and an Engine Auto Stop system that comes as standard that will automatically turn off the engine when an adjustable idling time has passed.
Elsewhere in the cab, a double adjustable air suspension seat for greater levels of comfort and operability comes as standard, while a full-colour, high resolution 7” LCD digital display screen ensures users can view all relevant operational information at a quick glance.
The machine, which is scheduled for its first Delivery in July, was shown to Kubota dealers in the UK last week alongside two new electric RT compact wheel loaders, which were first seen at Bauma last year.
The RT210-2e and RT220-2e are both powered by a 48V system with modular 260Ah lithium-ion batteries as standard and can be recharged via a Standard Integrated 40A on-board charger in seven hours. An optional supercharger can charge the machines fully within 90 minutes.
The RT210-2e’s long loader arm has a reach of up to 2,852mm, while the RT220-2e shorter loader arm has an increased lift capacity of up to 1,140kg.
Both the compact loaders and mini excavator will make their public debut next month at UK trade show plantworx."
26 May 2023,Heavy wheeled loaders: The workhorse of the construction site,"Heavy wheeled loaders have a home in almost every construction site and operators are spoilt for choice with the innovative machines manufacturers are releasing.
Komatsu Europe displayed the new WA800-8 wheeled loader at the demo ground at Bauma Munich in October 2022. The loader is said to have been designed for maximum operating comfort in addition to featuring a modulation clutch, variable traction control, an auto kick down and an RPM set.
The Japan-based company has also redesigned the machine’s extra-large 11.5m³ bucket, complete with its optimised maximum fill feature.
With a total operating weight of 115 tonnes, the WA800-8 meets the latest EU stage V emission regulations with a Komatsu-designed, developed and manufactured engine and after-treatment system.
“Our WA800 has always been well-appreciated for its reliability and productivity”, says Jo Monsieur, group manager for large machines at Komatsu Europe.
“And this latest generation surely continues this legacy. Furthermore, Komatsu has really set new standards for stability, comfort and safety and we are very proud to be able to offer this to our customers.”
Liebherr’s XPower wheeled loaders have established themselves at the forefront of fuel efficiency and robustness.
Liebherr says one reason is their power-split travel drive, installed as standard in all Liebherr XPower wheeled loaders. The combination of hydrostatic drive – advantageous for material uptake and travelling over short distances – and mechanical drive ensure that the machine works at maximum efficiency.
In addition to the two drive types, Liebherr offers a range of intelligent assistance systems for its mid-size and XPower wheeled loaders, including active personnel detection with brake assistance. The optional assistance system warns the machine operator of hazards in the rear area of the machine. Sensors and artificial intelligence combine to distinguish between people and objects for additional safety. As soon as the sensors detect a source of danger, the brake assistant automatically decelerates the wheel loader‘s speed. This shortens the stopping distance by multiple feet, reducing the frequency and intensity of potential accidents.
In Denmark, 40 Liebherr XPower wheel loaders are being used for material handling at RGS Nordic – which specialises in recycling construction and demolition waste materials.
Michael Jørgensen, strategic purchasing manager, commented, “The Liebherr wheel loaders need less fuel, are powerful and have hardly any downtime. We are particularly impressed that we achieve 30% more productivity with the same fuel consumption than with comparable wheel loaders in this size class.”
RGS Nordic was in the market for efficient wheel loaders with power-split drive to reduce CO2 emissions. With the company’s main focus on converting construction waste into reusable and circular products that can be integrated into the product cycle, it was important for the machinery used to reflect the same values.
Develon, formerly known as Doosan Construction Equipment, now offers the company’s latest generation ‘DL-7’ wheel loader range driven by new Stage V compliant engines and providing higher productivity, increased fuel efficiency and a low cost of ownership, coupled with a new cab offering an enhanced experience for the operator.
The four biggest standard models in the DL-7 range are the DL420-7, DL480-7, DL550-7 and DL580-7. The machines feature redesigned buckets offering up to 7% more capacity with maximum bucket capacities from 4.5 to 6.4 m3. Develon says that this provides increased productivity for a wide range of material-handling applications.
In addition to the company’s wheel loader range, Develon has introduced the ‘world’s first “transparent bucket” system’ for wheel loaders. The system is said to enable the wheel loader driver to see the blind spots in front of the machine’s bucket, using a monitor installed in the cab. By recording images with top and bottom front-loaded cameras and projecting the combined images in real-time using a curved projection method, the transparent bucket system provides a full view for the driver.
Develon says that the transparent bucket system addresses the issue of safety concerns caused by blind spots in front of wheel loaders due to their buckets. With this new feature, drivers can now easily check blind spots in front of the bucket via the cab monitor, increasing safety and reducing accidents.
Moreover, the transparent bucket system is said to enhance work efficiency by providing a forward view for the driver during loading, unloading, or carrying materials like aggregates, sand, and soil.
The company has applied for patents in Korea, North America, Europe, and China, making it the first company to develop and implement a front projection function with a transparent bucket for construction machinery.
A Develon spokesperson stated that advanced safety systems have become crucial in equipment selection with increasing safety standards. The company plans to continue developing safety features that prioritise driver and worker safety, aiming to lead the industry towards safer and accident-free construction sites.
Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has taken a major step forward in advancing its electromobility offerings with a new solution.
The company has converted its L120 wheel loader into an electric version, catering to the increasing demand for sustainable solutions in the mid-size range. The conversion was done in collaboration with partners Parker Hannifin and CE Engineering Solutions, a Volvo Group subsidiary.
The L120H Electric Conversion, available to selected customers in Europe from 2023, will provide the same performance as the conventional machine while emitting zero emissions.
Volvo CE says that it is committed to achieving a carbon-neutral construction industry and has partnered with CE Engineering Solutions and other electromobility partners to accelerate the availability of commercialised electric solutions across all segments and applications. This collaboration is part of the company’s efforts to expand its line of electric wheel loaders, following its investment in Dutch manufacturer Limach in June to broaden its electric excavator portfolio.
The L120H Electric Conversion is expected to provide numerous benefits to the construction industry, including reduced noise pollution, lower operating costs, and increased productivity. The machine’s electric powertrain also offers instant torque, making it more responsive and efficient than traditional combustion engines.
In addition, the electric version is designed to require less maintenance than its diesel counterpart, reducing downtime and increasing overall equipment availability.
Powered by 240 kWh batteries, the L120H provides a runtime of approximately five hours in most medium-duty applications. Consistent with Volvo’s existing charging solutions, it is estimated to charge from 0-100% in just 1.5-2 hours.
Carl Slotte, head of sales region Europe at Volvo CE, says, “There is no time to wait – we need to deliver solutions that allow our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Change starts here.
“Our commitment to partnership allows us to take a leading position in transforming our industry, with electric solutions that are built to fulfil market demand and tailored to suit the changing needs of our customers. Working together, we are scaling up our portfolio of electric machines, extending the versatility of our range and transforming our industry towards a carbon-neutral future.”
Depending on market demand, Volvo CE says there could be the possibility to convert existing users’ L120H wheel loaders to electric in the future.
Beyond sustainability, Volvo CE is significantly developing the safety systems that are available on their wheeled loaders.
Volvo CE has launched its Collision Mitigation System for Volvo Wheel Loaders, which aims to support operator response and reduce the risk of collision when working in reverse. The feature automatically applies the service brakes when the wheel loader approaches an obstacle, helping to mitigate the consequences of accidents and reduce the risk of unplanned interruptions.
The system is designed to facilitate job site safety and remembers the last slope the machine climbed for seamless stockpiling operations. Volvo CE says that it can be temporarily deactivated for specific site conditions and only functions when the wheel loader is in reverse and driving between 3-15 km/h. The Collision Mitigation System is a factory-fit option for a range of Volvo wheel loaders and is available globally.
Lars Eriksson, global product manager for wheel loaders at Volvo CE says, “We at Volvo CE continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions which not only mitigate the consequences of accidents but strive to avoid them altogether.
“This new Collision Mitigation System is one important part of our work to reduce the risk of accidents and help fulfil our commitment towards zero accidents.”
Volvo CE has developed the Collision Mitigation System in-house for its line of wheel loaders. This factory-fit option is currently offered on the L110H/L120H equipped with OptiShift, L150H, L180H, L220H, L260H, and L200H High-Lift wheel loaders.
To function, it requires a Radar Detect System to be installed, adding to the existing range of features, options, and site services designed by Volvo CE to promote job site safety and reduce unforeseen interruptions.
The heavy wheeled loader market is certainly busy. Enhancements are being made left, right and centre with almost a solution for everything. As always, it is an exciting time in equipment development and the year is sure to bring about more innovations."
26 May 2023,Wacker Neuson creates attachments business,"Wacker Neuson is creating a dedicated business unit for attachments for its products such as excavators, telehandlers and wheeled loaders.
The new division, which will become part of the company’s Aftermarket unit, will be led by managing director Reinhold Baisch, who has 25 years of experience in the construction equipment market, including many years with compaction specialist Hamm.
Alexander Greschner, CSO of the Wacker Neuson Group, said; “This further professionalisation of our attachments business will enable us to strengthen and build on this field, positioning us here also as a comprehensive customer-centric solution provider in the construction and agricultural sectors.”
Reinhold Baisch added; “The right attachments transform our compact machines into the versatile helpers our agricultural and construction customers have come to know and expect.
“We are also seeing exciting developments in this area, with digital assistance systems and standardised interfaces playing an increasingly important role.
“I am very much looking forward to establishing and advancing this segment.”"
18 May 2023,Digging with a twist: What are the advantages of a tiltrotator?,"Popular in Scandinavia, and growing in other areas of Europe, the tiltrotator is deemed to significantly increase machine efficiency.
The tiltrotator can look like a confusing bit of kit but it is possible to think of it as a wrist that directly connects to the excavator’s arm or beneath the excavator’s quick hitch. The tiltrotator is then connected to the excavator’s hydraulics and electrical system. Depending on the excavator’s extra hydraulics, control is adapted to suit different types of control system.
In the early 1980s, the Norgrens family introduced the Tiltrotator to the Swedish market under their family-owned and operated company Noreco, and since then it has become a standard in the Scandinavian region. The concept has also recently gained popularity in many other countries across the globe, including the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the United States.
Sven-Roger Ekström, senior product manager at Rototilt, understands the capabilities of tiltrotators better than most and believes that they have several benefits that could change the way we work on construction sites.
Upon asking Ekström why everyone should have a tiltrotator, he reels off a list of what he believes are the key advantages. “Your excavator becomes an efficient tool carrier in addition to working faster and more flexibly with fewer machine movements.”
Ekström adds that such qualities allow companies to take on new types of jobs and will require less manual labour around the machine.
Unfortunately, the skills shortage is as much a concern as it was in 2022 and including a new attachment into the field can cause apprehension for potential buyers, who may be uncertain about imposing such a complex attachment on operators.
Ekström, however, says it takes only a short time to become proficient with a tiltrotator. “If you are a skilled excavator operator you will need 1-2 weeks to perform really well. After that first jumpstart, you will start to see new opportunities such as how to solve working tasks in a new way and become even more efficient.”
Stefan Stockhaus, CEO of Steelwrist, believes that tiltrotators are also the answer to increasing safety in potentially dangerous working conditions. By using tiltrotators, jobs traditionally done outside the cabin can be moved into the cabin, removing ground workers from risk-prone roles. “It’s not all about efficiency,” he says. “It’s also about safety and becomes an alternative to a standard factor.”
Increasing efficiency is undoubtedly a huge advantage on the modern-day construction site and Ekström says tiltrotators can increase efficiency by 25% to 30% depending on the type of job. “On some jobs where you, with the combination excavator plus tiltrotator, can do the same job as two or three standard excavators you of course calculate with even higher figures,” he adds.
Steelwrist’s Stockhaus agrees with Rototilt’s Ekström regarding his sentiments on the tiltrotators ability to increase efficiency, but he adds that enjoyment is also a benefit. “In our case, 96% of all the experienced users say that the job is more fun. And if the job is more fun, it’s easier to attract good employees. Those are two really strong cases. As I see it anyway – efficiency, profitability, but also more fun.”
Mature markets, such as Scandinavia, have embraced the adoption of tiltrotators. Almost 90% of excavators in the region have the attachment, which is said to be crucial to winning projects as well as meeting specific sustainability goals.
While Scandinavia has fully adopted this form of attachment, the rest of Europe is somewhat slower. “It always take time to break new ground and to change old habits,” says Ekström.
“In Scandinavia, we have a long practice of getting more efficient because of expensive, and the lack of manual labour. We also have a market with many small contractors that often see the owner in the cab working with the equipment; therefore, he can quickly see the benefit of working in a new way.”
Stockhaus believes the popularity surrounding tiltrotators in Scandinavia comes from the region’s pressure on increased productivity – it is also the key to getting jobs.
Elsewhere in Europe, Ekström says that big companies with a large rental market often take longer to see the benefits. Other obstacles, he says, can be that as long as the contractors are satisfied with buying two or three machines instead of one machine with a tiltrotator, the dealers will not push the product until the customer asks for it.
Autumn 2022 saw Rototilt launch its Rototilt Control product concept featuring tiltrotators, joysticks, a new control system and a remote support app. The product has become well established in the market and companies are starting to realise their potential – Rototilt are now expanding the number of tiltrotators in their RC series.
The company confirmed that Rototilt’s R4 and R8 tiltrotators will gain counterparts in the RC series launched at Bauma last year. This means that Rototilt’s new RC System control system and the new RC Joysticks will be available to machines weighing between 10 and 43 tonnes.
The R4 tiltrotator has historically been one of Rototilt’s most popular products, according to Ekström, who has high expectations ahead of the sales launch.
He says, “We started in the mid-range but are now expanding the concept to encompass both bigger and small machines. Today we are delighted to offer increased energy efficiency and an improved driving experience for a wider range of machines and users.”
The new tiltrotator series, due to launch in February 2023, features pressure-compensated hydraulics and is said to deliver greater energy efficiency than its predecessors, in addition to enabling more controlled excavation movements.
As part of a joint initiative, Steelwrist and Rototilt have come together to set an industry standard for fully automated quick couplers under the Open-S Alliance. The non-profit organisation sets out to develop and promote the Open-S standard, with the ultimate aim of achieving global interchangeability between quick couplers, tiltrotators and work tools for excavators.
The alliance’s standardisation work has been ongoing for the last two years with the purpose to increase safety and efficiency for excavator owners, operators and ground personnel.
The partnership has started to create a uniform manufacturing standard for dimensions and tolerances as well as making it cost efficient to retrofit adaptor brackets to used and new buckets and work tools.
In 2021, Volvo Construction Equipment became the first excavator specialist to join the alliance in hopes to work with other industry partners on improving work tools for excavators. The demand for fully automatic quick couplers on excavators has continued to grow rapidly in general construction and it is said that all partners are seeing opportunities for growth in a variety of sectors.
Steelwrist and Rototilt are paving the way for the future of tiltrotators, in addition to the likes of Volvo Construction Equipment and Caterpillar. Scandinavia needs no convincing evidence of the advantages of tiltrotators and it seems the rest of Europe is taking a particular interest in increasing efficiency.
Last year, Caterpillar Work Tools Division announced new Tilt Rotate System (TRS) models for Cat 302.7 through 310 Next Generation Mini Excavators.
The new TRS4 and TRS8 S45 plus updated TRS6 models allow attached work tools to rotate 360 degrees and tilt 40 degrees side-to-side. This enables the machine to reach more work areas from a single position, while manoeuvring tools over, under, and around obstructions when excavating, grading ditches, sorting recycled materials, or placing pipe.
The new TRS models are said to multiply the mini excavator’s versatility and are available in various configurations to match the application.
The TRS6 and TRS8 feature a standard TRSAux2 auxiliary port at the bottom to connect a variety for different hydraulic tools whilst the compact design of the TRS4, TRS6 and TRS8 allows the mini excavator to maintain high digging forces.
TRS4 models are designed for efficient use by the 302.7, 303, 303.5 and 304 Mini Excavators, while the TRS6 models are compatible with the 305.5CR and 306 CR models. The TRS8 models are designed for use with the 307.5, 308, 308.5, 309 and 310.
Engcon is seeing “stable profitability” after reporting record-high net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022.
While the last three months of 2022 saw the company’s order intake decline by 29% SEK553 million (€49.4 million), its net sales increased to SEK541 million (€48.3 million).
This is up 46% on the SEK370 million (€33 million) the company brought in for the same period in 2021 - with operating profits also up 57% on the previous year to SEK 121 million (€10.8 million).
Overall, this resulted in a fourth quarter profit rise of 20%, to SEK 90 million ($8.6 million), up from SEK75 million (€6.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Engcon’s fourth quarter results meant that for the whole of 2022 the company saw an order intake rise of 1%, up from SEK1.96 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.97 billion (€171.4 million).
2022 net sales also increased by 30%, from SEK1.48 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.93 billion ($186 million), with profits last year amounting to SEK325 million (€29.6 million) - a rise of 21%.
Krister Blomgren, Engcon’s CEO, said, “Combined with increased economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rates, this led to an expected downturn in Nordic and European markets in the fourth quarter compared with exceptional comparative figures. Despite this, the order intake was at a high level when seen from a long-term perspective.
“It is worth noting that there was a break in the trend in 2022, with growth markets recording higher order intake than the Nordic region for the first time.”
Looking to the future, Engcon plans to continue investing in its third generation tiltrotator system and expand its sales network.

17 May 2023,Vermeer opens Global Parts Distribution Center,"Vermeer announced the opening of a new 312,000-sq.-ft. Global Parts Distribution Center, located on the campus of its Pella, Iowa, corporate headquarters. The facility will package and ship parts to customers and dealers worldwide.
The Global Parts Distribution Center is located at the end of what was once an old runway used by company founder Gary Vermeer to deliver parts by plane. Its placement within the corporate headquarters campus will allow it to leverage the manufacturing capabilities of the “Vermeer mile,” where most of the company’s products are assembled.
“Vermeer is focused on optimizing this facility so we can most efficiently deliver the right part at the right time to our customers. This facility allows customer support, engineering, procurement and logistics to be co-located. They work in conjunction with our operational team members to make sure we fulfill customer and dealer expectations daily,” said Tony Briggs, vice president of the Vermeer Lifecycle product group.
He noted that nearly one-third of the warehouse is filled with parts manufactured by the various plants located along the Vermeer mile. “It is very convenient for us to be located near the manufacturing facilities that supply those parts. Ultimately, we bundle the Vermeer-manufactured parts with other parts and ship the orders around the world to take care of our customers,” said Briggs.
The new Global Parts Distribution Center includes three times more space than the previous building, plus includes 23 dock doors, a warehouse management system and improved warehouse technology.
Its opening follows an earlier announcement by Vermeer of the expansion of its parts manufacturing footprint at its facility in Des Moines, Iowa, where horizontal directional drill tooling and utility tractor attachments are manufactured."
17 May 2023,Wacker Neuson celebrates 175th global anniversary,"On Monday, May 15, 2023, Wacker Neuson employees globally commemorated the company’s 175th anniversary. Its 6000 employees marked the celebration through a global call hosted by the company’s headquarters in Munich, Germany.
The company’s foundation was laid in 1848 when Johann Christian Wacker set up a blacksmith shop in Dresden, Germany. Early innovations from the company included the introduction of an electric rammer by Hermann Wacker in 1930, and the development of an internal vibrator for concrete consolidation in 1934, as well as a reversible plate for soil compaction.
Over 200 patents and utility models followed. In more recent years, Wacker Neuson has expanded into other equipment forms, including the addition of an all-new skid-steer and compact track loader line to the North American market in 2014, and later the Dual View Dumper for jobsite material handling. That same year, the company introduced two battery-powered rammers and the WL20e battery-powered wheel loader in Europe.
Today, the company’s products include an extensive line of battery-powered, zero-emission compaction and concrete consolidation products powered by the Battery One modular battery system. Future introductions in North America will include the EZ17e zero-emission mini excavator and battery-powered wheel loaders, dumpers and telehandlers.
“Taking the time to celebrate 175 years of quality and innovation reflects the commitment of our company to the many dedicated Wacker Neuson employees who have contributed to our global success throughout our history and those that are now leading us into a bright future,” said Gert Reichetseder, President and CEO, Wacker Neuson America Corporation.
“We originated the compaction industry and that will always be at the heart of Wacker Neuson, even as we grow our product offering into exciting new areas.”"
16 May 2023,Why America is ready for electric construction equipment,"
North America is ready for electric construction equipment, contrary to perceptions in some quarters that appetite for the machines lags that in Europe.
That’s according to Stephen Roy, president of Volvo Construction Equipment, Americas, speaking to International Construction.
Roy said he was seeing pockets of demand for electric machines across the USA, and that it wasn’t just their lower carbon emissions that was generating interest but the lower levels of noise and vibration.
When asked if electrically powered machines were likely to prove less popular in the North American market than in Europe, Roy said, “There are parts of the European market that are more progressive than other parts of the European market, so it’s not even the same in Europe and I think it’s the same here.
“We have states with high population density and when you go further towards the West Coast you get a lot more focus on environmental standards and more early adopters.”
Roy said he saw the trend to electrically powered machines continuing in the compact equipment market but also moving into the mid-range. Volvo is already piloting its first larger electrified excavator, the 22t EC230 in markets including Finland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, and the machine is now making its way to North America.
“We have customers that are already ready to demo and get familiar with it and then we’ll start production for North America next year,” Roy said. “For the larger machines we see some alternative power solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen combustion engines”. The company already displayed a 30t prototype hydrogen fuel cell articulated hauler at ConExpo 2023 earlier this year.
Roy also highlighted the fact that certain customers are interested in the lower levels of noise and vibration that electric machines can offer, rather than just their sustainability credentials.
“It’s not just about emissions. A lot of our customers are really excited about low noise and no vibrations, which can lead to improved operator conditions and also improved safety. We didn’t lead with that but we are finding that it’s just as important and creates new opportunities,” he said.
And he pointed to some unusual examples of where electric machines have proved a success in North America. “We’ve sold compact machines in areas that I would never have thought we’d sell them.
“We laugh about this but the Toronto Zoo needed machines to work at the same time that the buffalos were there but the noise from diesel machines scared them away. We also have an example of a school system that wanted to do some repairs as they are expanding a facility but the work was right next to a classroom and so again the electric machine was more suitable because it was lower noise.”
Roy said that the shift Volvo anticipated taking place in the market meant that competencies among its own workforce also had to change. “We’ve had to go out and search for people that have backgrounds in software and electrical engineering. It’s definitely a new ballgame but it’s a positive in that it’s bringing people into Volvo that maybe wouldn’t have considered it before. Electric and sustainable power brings a whole new generation of people who want to be part of this transformation.”
Meanwhile, Roy, who is set to become president of Volvo-owned Mack Trucks next month, said that machine control technology in construction equipment “continues to get better and more sophisticated”.
He highlighted Volvo’s Dig Assist platform. “We now have a process where you can have an expert operator dig a hole for a certain application. So maybe you were putting in a culvert in a subdivision and you need to dig the hole in the same way. An expert can go out and dig it to the parameters that we need, save the file and transfer it to another excavator. And that excavator operator can now benefit from the best practice of the first, experienced operator.”
And he pointed to the growing capabilities of Volvo’s remote-controlled machines and its productivity tools.
The OEM recently handed over a remote-controlled EC250 excavator to a customer in South Dakota who works installing pipes in a water sewer.
He also noted that Volvo has the capability to retrofit non-Volvo machines and link them into Volvo’s Connected Maps feature, which allows a visual overview in real time of the position and movement of every machine, vehicle and visitor to site.

10 May 2023,Develon launches new 6-tonne Stage V mini-excavators,"

Develon has launched the new DX62R-7 and DX63-7 6 tonne Stage V mini-excavators with a new shared global styling design.
The new mini-excavators are designed to offer maximum performance, optimum stability, increased versatility, enhanced operator comfort, controllability, durability, ease of maintenance and serviceability.

Both models are powered by the new D24 Stage V compliant diesel engine providing 44.3 kW (59.4 HP) of power. Develon says that despite offering an 8% increased torque of 26.5 kgm/rpm, the D24 engine still provides a 7% decrease in engine fuel consumption.


Moreover, the DX62R-7 and DX63-7 employ a Load Sensing System that operates on a new Main Control Valve. The mechanism enables a longer spool stroke, thereby enhancing controllability and work efficiency/performance in comparison to the previous models.
Both machines provide an auxiliary flow of 90 litres per minute, which improves the efficiency of work with attachments. The flow capacity can be easily monitored on the Develon Smart 8-inch touch screen in 10 increments and can be controlled using the thumbwheel located on the joystick.




The new cab on the DX62R-7 and DX63-7 features a full glass entry door to maximise operator visibility on this side of the machine from inside the cab. A rear-view camera is optional and the high luminance LED work lamps (which are standard) on the cab further enhance visibility and safety.








The mini-excavators include the latest Develon Fleet Management TMS 3.0 Cellular system installed as standard, which provides a telematics management system for the excavators, by collecting data from sensors on the machines."
09 May 2023,‘Significant’ Q1 growth for Wacker Neuson Group,"But the company admitted that it does not expect to improve on these figures during the rest of the year.
The Germany-based company’s revenue climbed by almost 28% year-on-year to €667.2 million, while EBIT (earnings before interest and taxation) – aided by a one-off sale of fixed assets – more than doubled to €87.8 million.
The EBIT margin of 13.2% was also considerably higher than the 7.5% achieved in 2022.
“As anticipated in our annual guidance, we have carried the full momentum from previous quarters into the new fiscal year and continued to grow significantly,” said Dr Karl Tragl, chairman of the executive board and CEO of the Wacker Neuson Group.
“At the same time, we continue to expect the first quarter to also be the strongest of 2023.” r
As in previous quarters, all three reporting regions contributed to growth in the first quarter with big increases.
In the Europe (EMEA) region, revenue rose by 22.4% €504 million compared to €411.6 million in 2022, with particularly positive growth in Germany.
On the product side, demand for excavators, wheeled loaders and telehandler increased noticeably.
The Americas region grew by 57% to €142.6 million, with a particular sharp year-on-year increase in the USA and further growth in Canada and South American markets.
Asia-Pacific region posted a lesser increase, by 7.3% to €20.6 million, driven primarily by the Australian market with products adapted to the needs of the local market and the focus on independent rental companies continuing to generate strong demand.
By contrast, the Chinese market continued to prove difficult and declined in the first quarter.
Speaking on supply chains after the group’s net working capital ratio fell from 31.9% to 30%, CFO Christian Burkhard said: “We are are still a long way from a normalisation of the situation.
“However, the continued increase in inventory levels paid off in the first quarter as we systematically exploited our growth opportunities. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that effective working capital management remains at the top of our agenda.”"
04 May 2023,Back to the future at Metso as Outotec dropped from company name,"Metso merged with Outotec in the summer of 2020 and the combined business has since acquired companies including Tesab and McCloskey International.
Yesterday, the sustainable technology specialist announced operating profits of €197 million (US$217 million) for the first quarter of 2023 after a 22% year-on-year increase in sales revenue.
Metso Outotec’s Executive Team has been renamed as the Metso Leadership Team.
“After the successful integration of Metso and Outotec, we will focus on growing a strong unified Metso company and brand,” said president and CEO of Metso, Pekka Vauramo.
“We have combined two valuable companies into one strong Metso.
“Our focus is clear: we continue enabling sustainable modern life and transforming the industry with a clear strategy and strong culture, supported by a name that is short yet established and well recognised among all our stakeholders.
“Services are an extremely important part of our business, requiring a strong name.”.
The company said that Outotec continues as a product brand and carries significant value as the name of some key technologies and products.
The change of the parent company name to Metso Corporation is effective from today, but globally the change will be implemented in a phased manner."
02 May 2023,7 things we learned from Caterpillar’s latest trading update,"

Last week saw Caterpillar unveil a strong performance for the first quarter of 2023, driven in large part by growth in North America.
Sales in its construction industries division increased by 10% to US$6.7 billion, while operating margin in the segment was 26.5%.
Here’s seven things we learned about Caterpillar’s performance, what it says about the wider construction industry, and where it could be heading:

Caterpillar reported better equipment availability thanks to improving supply chain conditions. But “pockets of challenge” still remain, particularly for large engines which could impact some of its larger machines.
In general, the supply chain improvements meant that Caterpillar was able to make stronger-than-expected shipments in North America, which is Caterpillar’s most constrained region as far as dealer inventory is concerned.
Caterpillar noted that there is now improved availability of its excavators. That has come about as a result not just of the lower pressure on supply chains but also because of a slowing of demand in China.
Caterpillar said it expected China’s above 10t excavator industry to remain below 2022 levels this year due to low construction activity, while its sales in China would be below the typical range of 5-10% of total Caterpillar sales in 2023.
The better availability of some types of machine in turn means that Caterpillar expects dealers to scale back their levels of inventory in the second half of the year, even though overall demand remains healthy.
The second half of 2022 saw dealers build their inventories to the tune of $1.4 billion. Talking to analysts, Caterpillar chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby said, “We are not planning for this trend to repeat [in the second half of 2023]. Instead, we expect to see dealers decrease inventories compared to the first quarter levels and end 2023 about flat relative to the end of 2022.”
Caterpillar’s overall adjusted operating profit margin for the period was 21.1% and hit 26.5% in the construction industries division. In a call with analysts, chief financial officer Andrew Bonfield explained that while Cat’s manufacturing costs did increase, they increased by less than the company anticipated.
Better-than-expected sales volumes meant factories could operate more efficiently, while freight costs were also lower. Meanwhile, the average price Caterpillar was able to charge for machines was higher than it had expected. These factors combined to boost the company’s profit margins.
But Bonfield said he did not expect the favourable effects of absorbing costs to last in the second half of the year, with margins in the remaining quarters of the year expected to be lower than the first quarter as the relationship between price and manufacturing costs normalized.
The US government has pledged to pump billions of dollars into infrastructure investments through measures such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BiL), which it is claimed involves up to $550 billion in new spending.
Umpleby confirmed that Caterpillar had started to see the positive impact of those infrastructure dollars in orders.
Speaking to analysts, he said, “The projects that don’t require a lot of permitting, things like resurfacing roads, have already started and we’re seeing the positive benefit of that.
“When customers believe there’s a pipeline of projects coming, they’re more likely typically to make that capital investment, to make a purchase of a new piece of equipment. It has started and we expect it to continue for some time.”
Caterpillar said it expected business activity in Europe, Middle East and Africa to increase in 2023 as compared to 2022. While that was down in large part to particularly strong construction demand in the Middle East, and while uncertain economic conditions remain, the company noted that European construction was “more resilient than we previously anticipated”.
When it came to mining equipment, Umpleby said he expected healthy demand, driven by the transition to new forms of energy. He noted that commodity prices remain above investment thresholds and said he expected production utilization levels to remain elevated.
He added, “We also expect the aging of the fleet and a lower level of parked trucks to support future demand for our equipment and services. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for profitable growth.”

02 May 2023,New 120 tonne XCMG AT crane for Europe,"



Chinese manufacturer XCMG has a new 120 tonne capacity all terrain crane for sale in Europe.
XCMG said the 120 tonne rating is calculated at 2.5 metres radius. At 3 metres the crane lifts 80 tonnes.
The XCA120 E on its four axle carrier has a 66 metre boom in six sections. An 11.65 to 18.5 metre, offsetable bi-fold swingaway jib can be added. Putting a pair of 7.1 metre lattice extensions in between the end of the boom and the swingaway gives a maximum tip height just beyond 96 metres. Maximum working radius is given as 60 metres.
An MTU diesel engine powers both the carrier and the crane upper. It has a ZF TraXon transmission with 12 forward speeds, driving the three rearmost axles. A retarder is also standard as is all wheel steering. XCMG said it has independent suspension “similar in overall concept to that used by Grove.”
Depending on tyre choice the crane’s overall width can be kept down to 2.75 metres. Overall length is given as being just over 14.3 metres.
Including their fully retracted position, the outriggers can be set at five spread widths: 3.83, 5, 5.9, and 7 metres. Maximum total counterweight is 33 tonnes, made up from eight slabs to allow multiple configurations.
June sees the official unveiling of the XCA120 E at the JDL Expo crane, transport and aerial work platform show in Beaune, France.

26 April 2023,Haulotte posts ‘historic’ revenues across the board,"France-based lift manufacturer Haulotte has reported “historic consolidated revenues” for the first quarter of 2023, amounting to €196.3 million (US$213.5 million).
The figure represents a 43% increase on the €135.8 million ($150 million) it achieved for the same period in 2022, and keeps the company on track to achieve its predicted 20% growth for 2023.
“All of the Group’s activities showed an increase compared with Q1 2022,” said Haulotte. “The sale of equipment is up by +48%, the rental business by +7% and finally the service business by +15%.”
These percentages equate to respective 2023 revenues of €172.6 million ($190.6 million), €5.8 million ($6.4 million) and €17.9 million ($19.7 million).

While the prediction takes into account a strong historic order book, the company describes the aerial platform market as “dynamic” and says that pressure on the components supply chain is continuing to ease.
Regionally, the company saw the biggest growth in North America, where the uptake of aerial platforms is continuing to rise.
“Haulotte confirmed the results seen in previous publications and posted growth of +72% in the first quarter, largely driven by the aerial work platform business, which more than doubled compared to the same period last year.”
The Latin American and Asia-Pacific regions both saw first quarter sales grow by 38% compared to the same period last year and “In Europe, sales were up by +35% in the first quarter, driven by all markets except for Russia, which is at a standstill”.

26 April 2023,Engineering firm converts 1.6t excavator into disaster rescue robot,"

Forth Engineering, based in Cumbria in the UK, has built a remote-controlled ‘rescue robot’ designed to be sent into disaster zones and controlled remotely.
The machine is based around a 1.6t JCB compactor excavator platform.
It is tetherless and can be controlled from a safe location up to 150 metres away.
It carries a 700bar rescue tool, a grapple hook to move obstructions, a hopper to disperse sand to contain spillages, and an affixative spraying system to contain a nuclear spillage.
The robot has already been trialled at Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria and Forth is now looking it rolling it out to other plants across the UK.
Mark Telford, Forth’s managing director, said: “The Rescue Robot is a pioneering development which has already been successfully tested in hazardous environments, and it has been manufactured to offer a safe, remotely operated alternative to sending humans into disaster zones.
“By working with Sellafield Ltd, we were able to prove the machine is able to withstand some particularly dangerous conditions, and its various adaptations and capabilities mean that this will be a real asset to the UK’s nuclear industry.
“There are endless amounts of modifications and end effectors which can be included on the robot, and we are excited to be able to provide a product which will make working in nuclear plants across the country much safer, while also saving industry a substantial amount of money.”
“Sellafield Ltd required the development of a 1.6 tonne robot, but we are able to adapt the product to any size and also fit it with any type of tools or end effectors to fit the nature of the project.
“What is extremely exciting to us is that it can also be adapted to work in any industry, and it is a real game changer in reaching some of the most dangerous environments found in sites across the UK.”"
25 April 2023,Online exclusive: Rokbak investigates electric and hydrogen-powered articulated trucks,"The idea of articulated trucks that can carry a payload of 30 tonnes being powered by electric power might seem far fetched but it is a possibility that the company Rokbak is looking into. Paul Douglas, Managing Director of the articulated truck company – which is part of the Volvo group – says that they are investigating all possibilities.

“Our trucks will have to be zero emissions somehow. The question is: what does that look like?” comments Douglas. “Electrification using battery technology that you can see today is a stretch for these big products because these are big power demand for long hours of usage.”
As Douglas says, electric power probably isn’t the best source for trucks due to how large they are and their work cycles – it isn’t uncommon for trucks to be run for 20 or 22 hours a day. “We are looking at hydrogen internal combustion engine and fuel cells to provide the electricity using hydrogen. These are technologies that Volvo is working with on their own highway truck and bus solutions.”
Douglas is originally an engineer and the challenges of cutting emissions and alternative power sources clearly excites him. He makes the point that, with technology developing at a rapid rate, no one in the construction industry can confidently state what the future will hold for power.
“It is easier to electrify the smaller stuff,” he says. “But there’s a lot of learning that comes from that. And you know, I can’t keep up with battery technology. It’s moving so quickly. Every six months battery capabilities seem to grow almost exponentially. I don’t know where it will all end up, but I think it’ll be a combination; some products will be batteries, some will be hydrogen fuel cells, and some will be hydrogen internal combustion.”
The last 18 months have been a boom time for both rigid and articulated haulers with numbers the highest they have been for around a decade at around 9,000 units a year. Part of this is due to pent up demand that followed the Covid-19 pandemic added to governments around the world investing in large infrastructure projects although Douglas believes that this is likely the peak of the market.
“We all felt at 8,000 units worldwide, that would be the peak. Then we said the same thing at 8,500, but now we are over 9,000 units. When I look around specific markets, we can see the slowdown coming, such as in Europe. I think we’re probably at the peak now. How long will that hold? Most of 2023 will probably level out [at current levels] although we could start to see a downturn in the second half of the year. It’s very strong at the moment, so we need to capitalise on that as much as we can.”
One of the markets that has driven this growth is North America, which Douglas says accounts for over half of Rokbak’s sales. In terms of smaller markets that have seen good growth he highlights Indonesia and the UK where the HS2 high-speed train project has played a key role in generating demand.
The brand of Rokbak has been around now for around 18 months following the name change from Terex Trucks. Douglas says that a huge effort went into this and that the response from the industry has been very positive. “The reception of it has been fantastic, first and foremost with our own dealer network because we were asking them to move from the old name to Rokbak. But they’ve gone with it, they’ve got a positive feel about it, they’ve invested into. The attraction that we’re getting from people that want to be on this journey with this, inquiries about becoming our dealer, has been really good.”
Talking about the dealer network, the change that we spoke about at the start of this article, from diesel powered trucks to alternative powered trucks, will impact dealers in more ways than one. First, they will be selling a different product and secondly there are different demands and opportunities with this.
“Your dealer partners, the people that sell and support the product – this is going to be a new adventure for them as well,” he says. “It’s new technology for them. An electric drive product probably gets less wear parts, less servicing and spares opportunity. That’s going be a real challenge for the traditional dealer. Their business model’s going to have to evolve.”
Equipment manufacturers have reduced emissions to meet different standards around the world and are now investing heavily into the R&D of alternative power sources, all while juggling issues such as rising inflation and a lack of skilled workers. It is a challenge, but Douglas gives off the sense that he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Moving into this new technology, new manufacturing processes are going to be required, new dealer models. There’s a real change, you can feel it in the air,” he says, pausing for breath before adding with a smile, “It’s fascinating.”"
24 April 2023,APEX 2023: a guide to what’s new at Maastricht show,"Unsurprisingly, green energy and digitization will be two focuses of the world’s largest dedicated exhibition for access equipment, taking place in June this year. Manufacturers will be out in force and here follows just a few examples of those.
Dinolift will be addressing all these, alongside electrification and sustainably, by promoting its MyDino telematics software at the show that will partly be demonstrated via mobile phone and tablet.
MyDino comes standard on all units, including the 280 RXTE lightweight boom lift pictured here, introduced from January.
The Finish manufacturer is also supporting the European green target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, with its the lithium version of its 280 RXTE model, launched last year.
Also, there will be the 23m working height 230 VTH chassis mounted unit, while trailer mounts will be represented by the 160XTB II.
Faresin will attend APEX for the first time and present the 6.26 Full Electric and 17.45 Classic 55 telehandlers.
Electrification will be one of the most important themes on the Faresin stand. The 6.26 Full Electric was launched in 2018 as the first electric telehandler in the world and has since then gone on to considerable success and updated versions.
Designed to be agile, quiet and sustainable, the 6.26 has a 2.6 tonne lifting capacity and a maximum height reach of 6m.
Created as a twin to the diesel-powered version, the full electric unit is suited to construction sites at night, zero-emission residential areas, livestock farms, greenhouses and food handling areas, such as cold rooms, wine cellars and food laboratories.
The 17.45 Classic 55 of the Big Range is created for greater heights, with a three-section boom for a maximum lifting height of 17 meters and a maximum load capacity of 4.5 tonnes.
XCMG will display eight models, including electric telescopic units and an electric 18m rough terrain scissor lift, among others.
It is worth mentioning that the XG1823ERT RT scissor and XGS28ACK telescopic boom are being introduced to Europe for the first time.
The electric XG1823ERT has a maximum working height of 18m with a large rated load of 700kg. The also electric XGS28ACK has a capacity of 460kg and the maximum operating height of 28.8m.
The telescopic XGS58E1 will also be at the exhibition. The super-large 58.6m working height model with 24.8m outreach, is a newly upgraded version of the pre-existing model of the same name. It has a 230kg/450kg dual load capacity.

19 April 2023,Small but mighty: The role of mini and midi excavators in modern projects,"Many manufacturers in the construction industry, certainly the larger ones, have expansive product ranges. One of the reasons for this is financial – the more products a company can sell and service the more money can be made – but another one is simple necessity; construction is such a broad industry that it requires a wide selection of equipment.
Out of all the equipment that is used in construction it is difficult to think of one that has grown in popularity quite as quickly as compact excavators such as the mini excavator (machines approximately 0-6 tonnes) and the midi (approximately 6-10 tonnes).
“The first mini excavators were produced in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a tool of necessity in the country’s famously dense and crowded cities,” explains Chris Sleight, managing director, Off-Highway Research. “By the 1980s they were being exported to Europe and North America, but it was not until the early 1990s when Japanese asset prices collapsed and the economy stagnated that these overseas markets became much more important to the sector’s (still predominantly) Japanese suppliers.”
By the late 1990s, Europe had overtaken Japan as the world’s largest mini excavator market, while demand in North America was matching that of Japan by the mid-2000s. However, it was not until around 15 years ago that the popularity of mini excavators became truly established.
“The previous peak in sales was in 2007, just prior to the impacts of the Lehman Bros. collapse and global economic crisis. That year saw just under 185,000 mini excavators sold worldwide. Fast forward to 2021, the latest peak in the mini excavator cycle, and more than 325,000 units were sold,” says Sleight.
Two key factors have driven this growth: compact excavators have increasingly replaced traditional machine types like the backhoe loader in Europe and North America thanks to the attraction of a smaller footprint, full 360-degree slewing and lower prices than backhoe loaders; they have also started to sell in significant numbers in emerging countries. The most notable has been China, where the mini excavator market peaked at more than 100,000 machines sold in 2020.
Timur Abied, utility product manager at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) tells International Construction that mini and midi excavators are among the OEMs fastest growing product segments with more efficient governance of energy being a main driver.
This sentiment is backed up by Cédric Durand, product management director EMEA, Yanmar Compact Equipment, who says that mini and midi excavators have been growing strongly over the past years.
He adds that, “From one year to another the growth can differ from one country to the other but almost all countries had a strong growth.”
Another smaller factor – but still important – behind the growth in the popularity of these machines is the increased use of attachments such as tiltrotators. “The growing popularity of tiltrotators has been a gamechanger for compact excavators, as tiltrotators allow an excavator operator to tilt and twirl an attachment 360 degrees,” says David Caldwell, national product manager, Takeuchi-US.
New technology is increasingly being integrated into mini and midi excavators, often from what was originally reserved for larger models. Stephane Dieu, excavators product manager, Europe, Develon (previously Doosan), says that, “With the arrival of our DX-7 range, all of the new mini excavators in the range are now equipped with our DoosanConnect telematics system, which was restricted in the past to only our medium and heavy segments – 14 tonne and over in the excavators. This gives our customers the opportunity to fully monitor their compact fleet.”
Chris Bardas, product manager, Hitachi Construction Machinery, reveals that the OEM’s latest mini and compact excavator are, “equipped with ICT solutions, safety features such as rear- and side-view cameras, and benefit from the Zaxis-6 cab, which is renowned for being highly comfortable and spacious, with an ergonomic seat and user-friendly controls.”
Wacker Neuson’s Klaus Allerstorfer, product manager, excavators, agrees that, increasingly, features are being added to mini and midi excavators that in the past were only for bigger models.
“Overall, more and more features are now being integrated into smaller models that were previously only used in larger models,” he explains.
“By features, I don’t just mean hardware, but also digital and data-driven solutions. One example is our EquipCare telematics solution, which makes it easier for our customers to manage their fleets and keep track of the condition of their machines.”
Electric powered equipment is a major trend in construction, especially in compact machines such as mini and midi excavators which many believe are more suited to this type of power than larger machines.
As is the case with many OEMs, Hitachi Construction Machinery has recently launched new electric models in this segment (ZX55U-6EB mini and ZX85-6EB compact) as has Takeuchi, with the all-electric TB20e.
Caterpillar, the world’s largest OEM, announced last year that its construction industries division was working on four new electric equipment machines, including the 301.9 Electric Mini Excavator powered by a Cat 48V, 32kWh battery with a run time of up to eight hours on a single charge.
Another new electric model is Bobcat’s 2-tonne mini-excavator the E19e – an electric version of the E19 internal-combustion model. It offers zero emissions, low-noise operation and comparable levels of performance to its diesel-powered counterpart.
The Bobcat E19e features the same profile and external dimensions. It features a 3.5-hour battery capacity and can be recharged quickly using a super-fast charger, meaning that, by topping up the power during work breaks, the machine can be used all day for the majority of typical applications.
Scott Park, Doosan Bobcat CEO, commented, “With the introduction of the E19e, Bobcat has expanded its larger-size electric line-up of zero emission and quiet machines that can match the excellent performance of our conventional models.”
Volvo CE has been at the centre of the development of electric powered construction equipment, with the OEM introducing its first electric compact models back in 2019 and now offering three compact electric excavators and two compact wheeled loaders. Volvo CE’s Abied says that the company are not just looking at compact equipment though, adding that, “While we started with electric mini excavators, we have also grown into the development of mid-size solutions such as our EC230 Electric excavator.”
While larger excavators may be increasingly electrified in the future, the focus is clearly on compact equipment such as mini and midi excavators.
A key point that OEMs make is that, as well as the benefits of electric power such as no emissions, no noise, no vibrations (thus a more comfortable environment for the operator), one thing is key: performance is just as good, if not better, than with diesel models.
Bardas from Hitachi sums it up by saying, “One of the main advantages of our zero-emission mini and compact excavators, the ZX55U-6EB and ZX85U-6EB, is the high level of performance they provide. No compromises have been made in terms of performance and they have been designed to provide similar levels of performance as diesel alternatives. The fact that they are zero-emission and quieter than diesel models are additional benefits.”
Despite all of the benefits that electric power brings, there are also challenges. Arguably the biggest one is the bottom line. To put it simply, electric machines are considerably more expensive than their diesel counterparts.
“When it comes to battery-powered solutions, the purchase price can be a hurdle,” admits Allerstorfer from Wacker Neuson. “But if you look at the total cost of ownership, the e-machines score with very low maintenance and operating costs, which in turn convinces many customers. In addition, we have found that renting the machines can help to quickly overcome initial doubts.”
Durand from Yanmar agrees that the higher cost is putting off some, but also makes the point that the total cost of ownership over the life of the machine can be less. “Indeed, the purchase cost is still higher than with traditional ICE machines. In the long run this price premium should decrease, and we are looking into the total cost of ownership as well which, at the end, is certainly the best criteria for profitability,” he says.
Another issue is undoubtably with charging and infrastructure. If construction is taking place on a remote site and not in a city then there may not be a power source to charge the battery. At the moment there are no universal standards regarding charging hardware and protocols.
“The lack of charging infrastructure and the still slower pace of introduction is a challenge and we need all stakeholders to help deliver the ecosystem required to support our electric machines and, in doing so, together achieve the strategic objectives of the Paris Agreement,” says Volvo CE’s Abied.
“High energy costs and the lack of financial and legal incentives also hamper deployment of strategic initiatives supporting electric power as the competitive solution for mini and midi excavators.”
When it comes to charging solutions increasing numbers of companies are producing fast charging options and there are other options, such as Wacker Neuson’s ‘charging box’.
“We are not only focusing on the development of zero emission products, but are also looking at entire construction site solutions,” says Allerstorfer.
“We will soon be launching our Charging Box, a mobile power bank for the construction site. This will enable customers to charge their zero emission products easily – and above all independently from local power sources.”
While electric mini and midi excavators are growing in popularity, the number of models sold are very small compared to diesel models. So, what’s next for these diesel models? More new technology being integrated into them that makes the life of an operator easier, and was previously reserved for larger machines, is one trend that will continue.
“These newer technological features all have one thing in common – they’re designed to help operators stay comfortable and more productive,” says Caldwell from Takeuchi US.
“They also help ensure that operators know exactly how their machines are performing by providing a great deal of information at their fingertips.”
In Wacker Neuson’s newest excavator, the wheeled EW100, Allerstorfer says that, “Digitisation played a major role in the development of this machine. For example, we have implemented an intelligent attachment management, a state-of-the-art Human-Machine-Interface, and the preparation for various assistance systems for process optimisation.”
Regarding sales around the world, mini and midi excavators are expected to continue to see strong numbers, if perhaps not at the same levels as in recent years.
Mini excavators are machines which replace manual labour. With the economic driver of rising labour costs (plus the difficulty in finding workers ) added to the fact that the purchase cost for these machines is cheaper than ever, adoption will continue.
“Drivers like these are at play in emerging markets, and the large-scale mini excavator industry which has sprung up in China means that machines are more affordable now than they were before,” says Off Highway Research’s Sleight. “This will help drive the adoption of this type of compact equipment around the world in the years to come.”
It will be interesting to see just what technology and power sources these mini and midi excavators of the future are equipped with as standard."
19 April 2023,"Second 3,000 tonne capacity Huisman giant crane for Havfram","
Havfram Wind has ordered its second 3,000 tonnes-plus capacity Huisman crane for offshore wind turbine installation.
Dutch crane and heavy engineering specialist Huisman will supply the Norwegian installation contractor with the giant leg encircling crane (LEC). Installation will be on the second new NG-20000X wind turbine installation vessel. This order follows the first, placed in mid-December 2022, for an identical crane which was the 13th LEC order for Huisman since 2021.
At the same time, Havfram ordered the second new NG-20000X vessel, on which the crane will be installed, from CIMC Raffles in China. It is designed by GustoMSC in the Netherlands and CIMC Raffles. The new vessels with their 3,000 tonne LECs will be able to install turbines with rotors up to 300 metres in diameter and monopile foundations weighing 3,000 tonnes to a water depth of 70 metres.
Huisman’s fully electric LECs for Havfram will have 155 metre booms and a lifting height around 180 metres above the deck. It is designed to be lightweight and reliable, with high positioning accuracy and energy efficiency in operation. Deck space is maximised by the short tail swing design. Its segmented slew bearing is designed for easy inspection and maintenance.
Speaking about the latest order David Roodenburg, Huisman CEO, said, “We are grateful that Havfram have placed their trust in us to also equip their second innovative new build vessel with a Huisman crane. They are constructing some of the world’s most energy efficient, hybrid-powered wind turbine installation vessels. We are proud that with the two crane orders, we can contribute to boosting wind energy production as well as further improving energy efficiency to reduce Havfram’s carbon footprint.”
Commenting on his choice of crane Håkon Johannessen, Havfram Wind engineering manager, said, “We are pleased to have Huisman supplying cranes for our newbuild wind turbine installation vessels. Huisman’s track record and willingness to tailor their already proven leg encircling crane design to fit the requirements of Havfram and the market has been key to ensuring we have the right tool for the tasks that lie ahead.”
Like the first unit this second crane will be built at the Huisman factory in Zhangzhou, China.
"
17 April 2023,IRE 2023: what equipment will be on show?,"Since the last edition of the International Rental Exhibition (IRE), it would be an understatement to say that plenty of innovation has taken place among manufacturers, driven by the demand for compact equipment, alternative power and environmentally friendly solutions.
The show will bring an array of those OEMs together under one roof to display just some of the latest launches and developments in construction equipment and technology, as well as aerial platforms through the APEX show, which is being held in conjunction with IRE.
With a wide range of equipment on show - more than 200 companies combined are exhibiting at IRE and APEX - here is a preview of what visitors can expect to see at IRE 2023.
The role of sustainability and low-emission equipment has continued to increase in recent years, and that theme will be highlighted at IRE as Sany will show the electrically driven SY19E mini excavator.
The machine, which the company says delivers zero pollutant emissions and significantly lower noise levels, comes with an electric motor that delivers a peak output of 15kW and an accumulator pack that lasts for an entire working day on one battery charge.
Charging the machine is made possible with a fast-charging station via DC in 1.5 hours, at a public AC charging station in 2.5 hours or overnight at a 220V socket.
Case Construction will highlight its CX15 EV 1.3 tonne mini excavator. Powered by a 16kW electric motor, the machine features retractable tracks that reduces machine width to 790mm and a load-sensing hydraulic system that is said to allow the operator to dial the machine into each task.
The 21.5kWh lithium-ion battery is charged either by the 110V/220V on-board charger or via an external rapid charger that can fully charge the machine in 90 minutes and can last up to an entire working day depending on the work, while its minimum swing radius design is said to make working close to structures and obstacles easier.
From its range of electric and low-emission machines, Yanmar will display several future-ready machines at IRE.
First up is the SV17e electric mini excavator prototype. Designed for the 1.5 to 2.0 tonnes segment, the unit is powered by an all-electric drive and has an open-centre hydraulic system with load-sensing hydraulic pump.
The SV17e delivers 23.5kWh gross electric power, while its 48V air-cooled motors provides “impressive digging, lifting and carrying capabilities,” according to Yanmar.
Another Yanmar prototype on show will be the V8e electric compact wheel loader with 40kWh battery capacity, hydrostatic drive and high-lifting capabilities.
The machine has an 800l loading bucket, 11kW charging in standard configuration and 22kW in optional fast charging.
Joining the SV17e and V8e is the C08e tracked carrier and ViO33 zero tail swing excavator.
With an 11.5kWh battery and a power capacity of 24V, Yanmar says the compact C08e has the “ultimate power and manoeuvrability to excel in tight spaces,” while the ViO33 is said to offer “true zero tail swing” and an “ultra-quiet and efficient engine” designed with low emissions in mind.
Launched in 2020, the eDingo 500 electric compact utility loader from Toro will make its European tradeshow debut at IRE having undergone several upgrades over the last three year’s.
An electric version of the Dingo 323, the machine produces zero engine-exhaust emissions and less noise thanks to its HyperCell Power System, a new lithium-ion battery system developed by Toro.
On its stand, Tobrocco Giant will show its latest line of electric loaders with the G2700E X-TRA, which is an electrically driven version of the powerful G2700 diesel series, and the G2200E X-TRA.
Both loaders are equipped with an 48V LPT-battery and have a pulling force of 12.500N. Optionally the battery can be charged at a car charging station. Said to be ideal for rental, the machine is described by the company as compact and easyily transportable.
Elsewhere on its stand, the company will show its GP1950E electric vibratory plate and the GR740E vibratory rammer.
JCB will show its latest innovations in zero-emissions technology and demonstrate its role in the move towards a cleaner, low-emission future for construction and rental equipment with its growing range of JCB E-TECH electric machinery.
The JCB 19C-1E - the world’s first electric mini excavator will take centre stage, the company say.
The machine is said to produce zero exhaust emissions at point of use and is “considerably quieter” than a standard machine.
Four lithium-ion batteries provide 20kWh of energy storage – enough for full working shift for many mini excavator customers on a single charge.
Also new will be a 2 tonne capacity E2000 electric site dumper from HG Machines in Denmark. This machine follows on from the ultra-compact 1 tonne capacity machines launched by the company in 2016. See more on this machine here.
The newly launched Archy rental platform from Gorman-Rupp Europe will be officially launched into the international market at IRE.
The platform aims to deliver “faster, easier and more reliable” pump rental by using a 10-step pump selector that can advise which pump is needed for specific projects.
It then suggests which pump will be ideal for the user and details how to reserve, rent and manage the pumps as well as all the rental pricing.
Gorman-Rupp say 100s of pumps will be available on the tool, including booster pumps, centrifugal pumps, diaphragm pumps, high pressure centrifugal pumps, pump hoses and submersible pumps.
Another new launch on show at IRE will be the Task Manager web application from Volvo CE. The worksite management tool, which is currently available in the North American market, is designed to connect people, machines and projects to ensure activities are delivered “on target, on time and to budget,” according to Volvo CE.
Swepac will show a line-up of reversible plates it is launching as part of its Battery One concept range.
The FB200B has a 4.6kWh onboard battery, 3.0kW IPM synchronous motor, 550mm wide base plate, while the larger FB300B has a 6.6kWh onboard battery, 10.0kW IPM synchronous motor and 600mm wide base plate.
The large onboard batteries enable them to reach sufficient running time without re-charging.
Users can monitor the progress of projects, set targets, track material on sites and manage data from mixed fleets in real-time. The data collected by Task Manager is then made accessible via mobile or laptop.
Spartan Solutions will debut its PHALANX V6 software platform that aims to streamline the process of equipment rental operations.
The platform utilises artificial intelligence (AI), expert rules and statistical algorithms to identify patterns and trends in equipment’s telematics and operations data. This data includes information about the performance, operation, maintenance, and usage of a machine.
Once the data is collected, the AI engine can detect any abnormalities or issues.
Launched at Bauma 2022, the HBOX+ Hybrid lighting tower will be presented by Himoinsa.
The tower combines a battery-powered system and Stage V diesel engine that is said to reduce noise and carbon footprint while keeping the 120,000-lumen light capacity of its diesel counterpart.
The HBOX+ Hybrid includes LFP batteries (Lithium Phosphate) that have been designed for a lifetime of 6000 cycles, while also offering four different working modes.
The HBOX+ Hybrid incorporates 4 x 350W LED spotlights and an LED Dimming Control which means the tower can start-up with dimming.
Himoinsa will also demonstrate the 45/60 model (60kW/h) of its EHR battery-powered generator which comes with its HICORE System.
Described as a compact, clean product, the generator can operate as a single source of power generation for as a recharging station for electrical construction machinery, as well as allowing integration with gas and diesel generator sets.
Vistors to the Briggs & Stratton stand will be able to see its newest Vanguard battery products and engine solutions.
The products on display include the Vanguard Si 1.5kWh Swappable Battery and the new Vanguard 400 EFI /ETC Single Cylinder (pictured).
The company says it developed the cylinder by working with OEMs to provide a “tailored power solution, that caters to each OEM’s specific requirements within the rental market.”
Generac Mobile will display the VT-Solar, a generator-free lighting tower with three solar panels that can recharge its built-in battery pack.
The tower is available in two versions, a manual-mast and hydraulic-mast version, which comes with higher battery capacity, powerful solar panels (400W each) and four LED floodlights with adjustable light power.
Exhibiting alongside Generac Mobile, Pramac will display its GRW Hybrid generator, which it describes as an efficient, reliable unit that reduces operational expenditure, with a choice of available operating modes that allow the correct selection according to site specifications.
Trime will present the X-SOLAR 4x60W LED lighting tower fitted with four 60W LED lamps.
The company says it is built to be robust, with galvanised metal works, and powder coating finish.
The zero-emission tower also has optional features, including a telemetry system for remote location and operational monitoring, an automatic start-up PIR operation, and dimmable lighting.
Elsehwere, ItalTower will exhibit its Street Solar lighting tower that it launched last year.
The tower with a 60W solar panel produces 6,000 lumens and has a lithium battery pack with a capacity of 14.8V.
Paclite will display its concept edging trowel, the M600.
Powered by a Vanguard engine, the new concept 600mm machine has been developed together with Cramo Sweden and is said to be ideal for rental due to its ABS fly wheel, which ensures concrete does not stick to the trowel.
Paclite says it will launch new versions of the M900 and M600 later this year, powered by a long-lasting battery-charger & motor.
Taking place from 6-8 June, IRE will be held at the MECC centre in Maastricht, the Netherlands, alongside APEX, the European Rental Association’s (ERA) annual Convention and the European Rental Awards.

29 May 2023,Kubota unveils new excavator,"Kubota has unveiled its latest addition to its line of mini excavators with the new 8.5 tonne KX085-5.
The excavator, which is said to come with more than 20 improvements over the previous ‘dash 4’ model, is powered by a low-emission Kubota engine and can be equipped with a two-piece boom for expanded working range.
The KX085-5 includes an auto-idling system that automatically reduces the engine RPM to idling speed when the control levers are left in neutral for more than four seconds.
Kubota says the machine was designed to “ensure operators can save energy and running costs, as well as reduce noise and exhaust emissions” and boost work efficiency and increase productivity through its hydraulic mechanism that enables operators to run the arm, boom, bucket, and swivel simultaneously.
Other features include two auxiliary circuits with adjustable maximum oil flow, load sensing hydraulic system, float function, auto-shift system, a redesigned cab with wider entry point and floor and an Engine Auto Stop system that comes as standard that will automatically turn off the engine when an adjustable idling time has passed.
Elsewhere in the cab, a double adjustable air suspension seat for greater levels of comfort and operability comes as standard, while a full-colour, high resolution 7” LCD digital display screen ensures users can view all relevant operational information at a quick glance.
The machine, which is scheduled for its first Delivery in July, was shown to Kubota dealers in the UK last week alongside two new electric RT compact wheel loaders, which were first seen at Bauma last year.
The RT210-2e and RT220-2e are both powered by a 48V system with modular 260Ah lithium-ion batteries as standard and can be recharged via a Standard Integrated 40A on-board charger in seven hours. An optional supercharger can charge the machines fully within 90 minutes.
The RT210-2e’s long loader arm has a reach of up to 2,852mm, while the RT220-2e shorter loader arm has an increased lift capacity of up to 1,140kg.
Both the compact loaders and mini excavator will make their public debut next month at UK trade show plantworx."
26 May 2023,Heavy wheeled loaders: The workhorse of the construction site,"Heavy wheeled loaders have a home in almost every construction site and operators are spoilt for choice with the innovative machines manufacturers are releasing.
Komatsu Europe displayed the new WA800-8 wheeled loader at the demo ground at Bauma Munich in October 2022. The loader is said to have been designed for maximum operating comfort in addition to featuring a modulation clutch, variable traction control, an auto kick down and an RPM set.
The Japan-based company has also redesigned the machine’s extra-large 11.5m³ bucket, complete with its optimised maximum fill feature.
With a total operating weight of 115 tonnes, the WA800-8 meets the latest EU stage V emission regulations with a Komatsu-designed, developed and manufactured engine and after-treatment system.
“Our WA800 has always been well-appreciated for its reliability and productivity”, says Jo Monsieur, group manager for large machines at Komatsu Europe.
“And this latest generation surely continues this legacy. Furthermore, Komatsu has really set new standards for stability, comfort and safety and we are very proud to be able to offer this to our customers.”
Liebherr’s XPower wheeled loaders have established themselves at the forefront of fuel efficiency and robustness.
Liebherr says one reason is their power-split travel drive, installed as standard in all Liebherr XPower wheeled loaders. The combination of hydrostatic drive – advantageous for material uptake and travelling over short distances – and mechanical drive ensure that the machine works at maximum efficiency.
In addition to the two drive types, Liebherr offers a range of intelligent assistance systems for its mid-size and XPower wheeled loaders, including active personnel detection with brake assistance. The optional assistance system warns the machine operator of hazards in the rear area of the machine. Sensors and artificial intelligence combine to distinguish between people and objects for additional safety. As soon as the sensors detect a source of danger, the brake assistant automatically decelerates the wheel loader‘s speed. This shortens the stopping distance by multiple feet, reducing the frequency and intensity of potential accidents.
In Denmark, 40 Liebherr XPower wheel loaders are being used for material handling at RGS Nordic – which specialises in recycling construction and demolition waste materials.
Michael Jørgensen, strategic purchasing manager, commented, “The Liebherr wheel loaders need less fuel, are powerful and have hardly any downtime. We are particularly impressed that we achieve 30% more productivity with the same fuel consumption than with comparable wheel loaders in this size class.”
RGS Nordic was in the market for efficient wheel loaders with power-split drive to reduce CO2 emissions. With the company’s main focus on converting construction waste into reusable and circular products that can be integrated into the product cycle, it was important for the machinery used to reflect the same values.
Develon, formerly known as Doosan Construction Equipment, now offers the company’s latest generation ‘DL-7’ wheel loader range driven by new Stage V compliant engines and providing higher productivity, increased fuel efficiency and a low cost of ownership, coupled with a new cab offering an enhanced experience for the operator.
The four biggest standard models in the DL-7 range are the DL420-7, DL480-7, DL550-7 and DL580-7. The machines feature redesigned buckets offering up to 7% more capacity with maximum bucket capacities from 4.5 to 6.4 m3. Develon says that this provides increased productivity for a wide range of material-handling applications.
In addition to the company’s wheel loader range, Develon has introduced the ‘world’s first “transparent bucket” system’ for wheel loaders. The system is said to enable the wheel loader driver to see the blind spots in front of the machine’s bucket, using a monitor installed in the cab. By recording images with top and bottom front-loaded cameras and projecting the combined images in real-time using a curved projection method, the transparent bucket system provides a full view for the driver.
Develon says that the transparent bucket system addresses the issue of safety concerns caused by blind spots in front of wheel loaders due to their buckets. With this new feature, drivers can now easily check blind spots in front of the bucket via the cab monitor, increasing safety and reducing accidents.
Moreover, the transparent bucket system is said to enhance work efficiency by providing a forward view for the driver during loading, unloading, or carrying materials like aggregates, sand, and soil.
The company has applied for patents in Korea, North America, Europe, and China, making it the first company to develop and implement a front projection function with a transparent bucket for construction machinery.
A Develon spokesperson stated that advanced safety systems have become crucial in equipment selection with increasing safety standards. The company plans to continue developing safety features that prioritise driver and worker safety, aiming to lead the industry towards safer and accident-free construction sites.
Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has taken a major step forward in advancing its electromobility offerings with a new solution.
The company has converted its L120 wheel loader into an electric version, catering to the increasing demand for sustainable solutions in the mid-size range. The conversion was done in collaboration with partners Parker Hannifin and CE Engineering Solutions, a Volvo Group subsidiary.
The L120H Electric Conversion, available to selected customers in Europe from 2023, will provide the same performance as the conventional machine while emitting zero emissions.
Volvo CE says that it is committed to achieving a carbon-neutral construction industry and has partnered with CE Engineering Solutions and other electromobility partners to accelerate the availability of commercialised electric solutions across all segments and applications. This collaboration is part of the company’s efforts to expand its line of electric wheel loaders, following its investment in Dutch manufacturer Limach in June to broaden its electric excavator portfolio.
The L120H Electric Conversion is expected to provide numerous benefits to the construction industry, including reduced noise pollution, lower operating costs, and increased productivity. The machine’s electric powertrain also offers instant torque, making it more responsive and efficient than traditional combustion engines.
In addition, the electric version is designed to require less maintenance than its diesel counterpart, reducing downtime and increasing overall equipment availability.
Powered by 240 kWh batteries, the L120H provides a runtime of approximately five hours in most medium-duty applications. Consistent with Volvo’s existing charging solutions, it is estimated to charge from 0-100% in just 1.5-2 hours.
Carl Slotte, head of sales region Europe at Volvo CE, says, “There is no time to wait – we need to deliver solutions that allow our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Change starts here.
“Our commitment to partnership allows us to take a leading position in transforming our industry, with electric solutions that are built to fulfil market demand and tailored to suit the changing needs of our customers. Working together, we are scaling up our portfolio of electric machines, extending the versatility of our range and transforming our industry towards a carbon-neutral future.”
Depending on market demand, Volvo CE says there could be the possibility to convert existing users’ L120H wheel loaders to electric in the future.
Beyond sustainability, Volvo CE is significantly developing the safety systems that are available on their wheeled loaders.
Volvo CE has launched its Collision Mitigation System for Volvo Wheel Loaders, which aims to support operator response and reduce the risk of collision when working in reverse. The feature automatically applies the service brakes when the wheel loader approaches an obstacle, helping to mitigate the consequences of accidents and reduce the risk of unplanned interruptions.
The system is designed to facilitate job site safety and remembers the last slope the machine climbed for seamless stockpiling operations. Volvo CE says that it can be temporarily deactivated for specific site conditions and only functions when the wheel loader is in reverse and driving between 3-15 km/h. The Collision Mitigation System is a factory-fit option for a range of Volvo wheel loaders and is available globally.
Lars Eriksson, global product manager for wheel loaders at Volvo CE says, “We at Volvo CE continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions which not only mitigate the consequences of accidents but strive to avoid them altogether.
“This new Collision Mitigation System is one important part of our work to reduce the risk of accidents and help fulfil our commitment towards zero accidents.”
Volvo CE has developed the Collision Mitigation System in-house for its line of wheel loaders. This factory-fit option is currently offered on the L110H/L120H equipped with OptiShift, L150H, L180H, L220H, L260H, and L200H High-Lift wheel loaders.
To function, it requires a Radar Detect System to be installed, adding to the existing range of features, options, and site services designed by Volvo CE to promote job site safety and reduce unforeseen interruptions.
The heavy wheeled loader market is certainly busy. Enhancements are being made left, right and centre with almost a solution for everything. As always, it is an exciting time in equipment development and the year is sure to bring about more innovations."
26 May 2023,Wacker Neuson creates attachments business,"Wacker Neuson is creating a dedicated business unit for attachments for its products such as excavators, telehandlers and wheeled loaders.
The new division, which will become part of the company’s Aftermarket unit, will be led by managing director Reinhold Baisch, who has 25 years of experience in the construction equipment market, including many years with compaction specialist Hamm.
Alexander Greschner, CSO of the Wacker Neuson Group, said; “This further professionalisation of our attachments business will enable us to strengthen and build on this field, positioning us here also as a comprehensive customer-centric solution provider in the construction and agricultural sectors.”
Reinhold Baisch added; “The right attachments transform our compact machines into the versatile helpers our agricultural and construction customers have come to know and expect.
“We are also seeing exciting developments in this area, with digital assistance systems and standardised interfaces playing an increasingly important role.
“I am very much looking forward to establishing and advancing this segment.”"
18 May 2023,Digging with a twist: What are the advantages of a tiltrotator?,"Popular in Scandinavia, and growing in other areas of Europe, the tiltrotator is deemed to significantly increase machine efficiency.
The tiltrotator can look like a confusing bit of kit but it is possible to think of it as a wrist that directly connects to the excavator’s arm or beneath the excavator’s quick hitch. The tiltrotator is then connected to the excavator’s hydraulics and electrical system. Depending on the excavator’s extra hydraulics, control is adapted to suit different types of control system.
In the early 1980s, the Norgrens family introduced the Tiltrotator to the Swedish market under their family-owned and operated company Noreco, and since then it has become a standard in the Scandinavian region. The concept has also recently gained popularity in many other countries across the globe, including the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the United States.
Sven-Roger Ekström, senior product manager at Rototilt, understands the capabilities of tiltrotators better than most and believes that they have several benefits that could change the way we work on construction sites.
Upon asking Ekström why everyone should have a tiltrotator, he reels off a list of what he believes are the key advantages. “Your excavator becomes an efficient tool carrier in addition to working faster and more flexibly with fewer machine movements.”
Ekström adds that such qualities allow companies to take on new types of jobs and will require less manual labour around the machine.
Unfortunately, the skills shortage is as much a concern as it was in 2022 and including a new attachment into the field can cause apprehension for potential buyers, who may be uncertain about imposing such a complex attachment on operators.
Ekström, however, says it takes only a short time to become proficient with a tiltrotator. “If you are a skilled excavator operator you will need 1-2 weeks to perform really well. After that first jumpstart, you will start to see new opportunities such as how to solve working tasks in a new way and become even more efficient.”
Stefan Stockhaus, CEO of Steelwrist, believes that tiltrotators are also the answer to increasing safety in potentially dangerous working conditions. By using tiltrotators, jobs traditionally done outside the cabin can be moved into the cabin, removing ground workers from risk-prone roles. “It’s not all about efficiency,” he says. “It’s also about safety and becomes an alternative to a standard factor.”
Increasing efficiency is undoubtedly a huge advantage on the modern-day construction site and Ekström says tiltrotators can increase efficiency by 25% to 30% depending on the type of job. “On some jobs where you, with the combination excavator plus tiltrotator, can do the same job as two or three standard excavators you of course calculate with even higher figures,” he adds.
Steelwrist’s Stockhaus agrees with Rototilt’s Ekström regarding his sentiments on the tiltrotators ability to increase efficiency, but he adds that enjoyment is also a benefit. “In our case, 96% of all the experienced users say that the job is more fun. And if the job is more fun, it’s easier to attract good employees. Those are two really strong cases. As I see it anyway – efficiency, profitability, but also more fun.”
Mature markets, such as Scandinavia, have embraced the adoption of tiltrotators. Almost 90% of excavators in the region have the attachment, which is said to be crucial to winning projects as well as meeting specific sustainability goals.
While Scandinavia has fully adopted this form of attachment, the rest of Europe is somewhat slower. “It always take time to break new ground and to change old habits,” says Ekström.
“In Scandinavia, we have a long practice of getting more efficient because of expensive, and the lack of manual labour. We also have a market with many small contractors that often see the owner in the cab working with the equipment; therefore, he can quickly see the benefit of working in a new way.”
Stockhaus believes the popularity surrounding tiltrotators in Scandinavia comes from the region’s pressure on increased productivity – it is also the key to getting jobs.
Elsewhere in Europe, Ekström says that big companies with a large rental market often take longer to see the benefits. Other obstacles, he says, can be that as long as the contractors are satisfied with buying two or three machines instead of one machine with a tiltrotator, the dealers will not push the product until the customer asks for it.
Autumn 2022 saw Rototilt launch its Rototilt Control product concept featuring tiltrotators, joysticks, a new control system and a remote support app. The product has become well established in the market and companies are starting to realise their potential – Rototilt are now expanding the number of tiltrotators in their RC series.
The company confirmed that Rototilt’s R4 and R8 tiltrotators will gain counterparts in the RC series launched at Bauma last year. This means that Rototilt’s new RC System control system and the new RC Joysticks will be available to machines weighing between 10 and 43 tonnes.
The R4 tiltrotator has historically been one of Rototilt’s most popular products, according to Ekström, who has high expectations ahead of the sales launch.
He says, “We started in the mid-range but are now expanding the concept to encompass both bigger and small machines. Today we are delighted to offer increased energy efficiency and an improved driving experience for a wider range of machines and users.”
The new tiltrotator series, due to launch in February 2023, features pressure-compensated hydraulics and is said to deliver greater energy efficiency than its predecessors, in addition to enabling more controlled excavation movements.
As part of a joint initiative, Steelwrist and Rototilt have come together to set an industry standard for fully automated quick couplers under the Open-S Alliance. The non-profit organisation sets out to develop and promote the Open-S standard, with the ultimate aim of achieving global interchangeability between quick couplers, tiltrotators and work tools for excavators.
The alliance’s standardisation work has been ongoing for the last two years with the purpose to increase safety and efficiency for excavator owners, operators and ground personnel.
The partnership has started to create a uniform manufacturing standard for dimensions and tolerances as well as making it cost efficient to retrofit adaptor brackets to used and new buckets and work tools.
In 2021, Volvo Construction Equipment became the first excavator specialist to join the alliance in hopes to work with other industry partners on improving work tools for excavators. The demand for fully automatic quick couplers on excavators has continued to grow rapidly in general construction and it is said that all partners are seeing opportunities for growth in a variety of sectors.
Steelwrist and Rototilt are paving the way for the future of tiltrotators, in addition to the likes of Volvo Construction Equipment and Caterpillar. Scandinavia needs no convincing evidence of the advantages of tiltrotators and it seems the rest of Europe is taking a particular interest in increasing efficiency.
Last year, Caterpillar Work Tools Division announced new Tilt Rotate System (TRS) models for Cat 302.7 through 310 Next Generation Mini Excavators.
The new TRS4 and TRS8 S45 plus updated TRS6 models allow attached work tools to rotate 360 degrees and tilt 40 degrees side-to-side. This enables the machine to reach more work areas from a single position, while manoeuvring tools over, under, and around obstructions when excavating, grading ditches, sorting recycled materials, or placing pipe.
The new TRS models are said to multiply the mini excavator’s versatility and are available in various configurations to match the application.
The TRS6 and TRS8 feature a standard TRSAux2 auxiliary port at the bottom to connect a variety for different hydraulic tools whilst the compact design of the TRS4, TRS6 and TRS8 allows the mini excavator to maintain high digging forces.
TRS4 models are designed for efficient use by the 302.7, 303, 303.5 and 304 Mini Excavators, while the TRS6 models are compatible with the 305.5CR and 306 CR models. The TRS8 models are designed for use with the 307.5, 308, 308.5, 309 and 310.
Engcon is seeing “stable profitability” after reporting record-high net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022.
While the last three months of 2022 saw the company’s order intake decline by 29% SEK553 million (€49.4 million), its net sales increased to SEK541 million (€48.3 million).
This is up 46% on the SEK370 million (€33 million) the company brought in for the same period in 2021 - with operating profits also up 57% on the previous year to SEK 121 million (€10.8 million).
Overall, this resulted in a fourth quarter profit rise of 20%, to SEK 90 million ($8.6 million), up from SEK75 million (€6.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Engcon’s fourth quarter results meant that for the whole of 2022 the company saw an order intake rise of 1%, up from SEK1.96 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.97 billion (€171.4 million).
2022 net sales also increased by 30%, from SEK1.48 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.93 billion ($186 million), with profits last year amounting to SEK325 million (€29.6 million) - a rise of 21%.
Krister Blomgren, Engcon’s CEO, said, “Combined with increased economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rates, this led to an expected downturn in Nordic and European markets in the fourth quarter compared with exceptional comparative figures. Despite this, the order intake was at a high level when seen from a long-term perspective.
“It is worth noting that there was a break in the trend in 2022, with growth markets recording higher order intake than the Nordic region for the first time.”
Looking to the future, Engcon plans to continue investing in its third generation tiltrotator system and expand its sales network.

17 May 2023,Vermeer opens Global Parts Distribution Center,"Vermeer announced the opening of a new 312,000-sq.-ft. Global Parts Distribution Center, located on the campus of its Pella, Iowa, corporate headquarters. The facility will package and ship parts to customers and dealers worldwide.
The Global Parts Distribution Center is located at the end of what was once an old runway used by company founder Gary Vermeer to deliver parts by plane. Its placement within the corporate headquarters campus will allow it to leverage the manufacturing capabilities of the “Vermeer mile,” where most of the company’s products are assembled.
“Vermeer is focused on optimizing this facility so we can most efficiently deliver the right part at the right time to our customers. This facility allows customer support, engineering, procurement and logistics to be co-located. They work in conjunction with our operational team members to make sure we fulfill customer and dealer expectations daily,” said Tony Briggs, vice president of the Vermeer Lifecycle product group.
He noted that nearly one-third of the warehouse is filled with parts manufactured by the various plants located along the Vermeer mile. “It is very convenient for us to be located near the manufacturing facilities that supply those parts. Ultimately, we bundle the Vermeer-manufactured parts with other parts and ship the orders around the world to take care of our customers,” said Briggs.
The new Global Parts Distribution Center includes three times more space than the previous building, plus includes 23 dock doors, a warehouse management system and improved warehouse technology.
Its opening follows an earlier announcement by Vermeer of the expansion of its parts manufacturing footprint at its facility in Des Moines, Iowa, where horizontal directional drill tooling and utility tractor attachments are manufactured."
17 May 2023,Wacker Neuson celebrates 175th global anniversary,"On Monday, May 15, 2023, Wacker Neuson employees globally commemorated the company’s 175th anniversary. Its 6000 employees marked the celebration through a global call hosted by the company’s headquarters in Munich, Germany.
The company’s foundation was laid in 1848 when Johann Christian Wacker set up a blacksmith shop in Dresden, Germany. Early innovations from the company included the introduction of an electric rammer by Hermann Wacker in 1930, and the development of an internal vibrator for concrete consolidation in 1934, as well as a reversible plate for soil compaction.
Over 200 patents and utility models followed. In more recent years, Wacker Neuson has expanded into other equipment forms, including the addition of an all-new skid-steer and compact track loader line to the North American market in 2014, and later the Dual View Dumper for jobsite material handling. That same year, the company introduced two battery-powered rammers and the WL20e battery-powered wheel loader in Europe.
Today, the company’s products include an extensive line of battery-powered, zero-emission compaction and concrete consolidation products powered by the Battery One modular battery system. Future introductions in North America will include the EZ17e zero-emission mini excavator and battery-powered wheel loaders, dumpers and telehandlers.
“Taking the time to celebrate 175 years of quality and innovation reflects the commitment of our company to the many dedicated Wacker Neuson employees who have contributed to our global success throughout our history and those that are now leading us into a bright future,” said Gert Reichetseder, President and CEO, Wacker Neuson America Corporation.
“We originated the compaction industry and that will always be at the heart of Wacker Neuson, even as we grow our product offering into exciting new areas.”"
16 May 2023,Why America is ready for electric construction equipment,"
North America is ready for electric construction equipment, contrary to perceptions in some quarters that appetite for the machines lags that in Europe.
That’s according to Stephen Roy, president of Volvo Construction Equipment, Americas, speaking to International Construction.
Roy said he was seeing pockets of demand for electric machines across the USA, and that it wasn’t just their lower carbon emissions that was generating interest but the lower levels of noise and vibration.
When asked if electrically powered machines were likely to prove less popular in the North American market than in Europe, Roy said, “There are parts of the European market that are more progressive than other parts of the European market, so it’s not even the same in Europe and I think it’s the same here.
“We have states with high population density and when you go further towards the West Coast you get a lot more focus on environmental standards and more early adopters.”
Roy said he saw the trend to electrically powered machines continuing in the compact equipment market but also moving into the mid-range. Volvo is already piloting its first larger electrified excavator, the 22t EC230 in markets including Finland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, and the machine is now making its way to North America.
“We have customers that are already ready to demo and get familiar with it and then we’ll start production for North America next year,” Roy said. “For the larger machines we see some alternative power solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen combustion engines”. The company already displayed a 30t prototype hydrogen fuel cell articulated hauler at ConExpo 2023 earlier this year.
Roy also highlighted the fact that certain customers are interested in the lower levels of noise and vibration that electric machines can offer, rather than just their sustainability credentials.
“It’s not just about emissions. A lot of our customers are really excited about low noise and no vibrations, which can lead to improved operator conditions and also improved safety. We didn’t lead with that but we are finding that it’s just as important and creates new opportunities,” he said.
And he pointed to some unusual examples of where electric machines have proved a success in North America. “We’ve sold compact machines in areas that I would never have thought we’d sell them.
“We laugh about this but the Toronto Zoo needed machines to work at the same time that the buffalos were there but the noise from diesel machines scared them away. We also have an example of a school system that wanted to do some repairs as they are expanding a facility but the work was right next to a classroom and so again the electric machine was more suitable because it was lower noise.”
Roy said that the shift Volvo anticipated taking place in the market meant that competencies among its own workforce also had to change. “We’ve had to go out and search for people that have backgrounds in software and electrical engineering. It’s definitely a new ballgame but it’s a positive in that it’s bringing people into Volvo that maybe wouldn’t have considered it before. Electric and sustainable power brings a whole new generation of people who want to be part of this transformation.”
Meanwhile, Roy, who is set to become president of Volvo-owned Mack Trucks next month, said that machine control technology in construction equipment “continues to get better and more sophisticated”.
He highlighted Volvo’s Dig Assist platform. “We now have a process where you can have an expert operator dig a hole for a certain application. So maybe you were putting in a culvert in a subdivision and you need to dig the hole in the same way. An expert can go out and dig it to the parameters that we need, save the file and transfer it to another excavator. And that excavator operator can now benefit from the best practice of the first, experienced operator.”
And he pointed to the growing capabilities of Volvo’s remote-controlled machines and its productivity tools.
The OEM recently handed over a remote-controlled EC250 excavator to a customer in South Dakota who works installing pipes in a water sewer.
He also noted that Volvo has the capability to retrofit non-Volvo machines and link them into Volvo’s Connected Maps feature, which allows a visual overview in real time of the position and movement of every machine, vehicle and visitor to site.

10 May 2023,Develon launches new 6-tonne Stage V mini-excavators,"

Develon has launched the new DX62R-7 and DX63-7 6 tonne Stage V mini-excavators with a new shared global styling design.
The new mini-excavators are designed to offer maximum performance, optimum stability, increased versatility, enhanced operator comfort, controllability, durability, ease of maintenance and serviceability.

Both models are powered by the new D24 Stage V compliant diesel engine providing 44.3 kW (59.4 HP) of power. Develon says that despite offering an 8% increased torque of 26.5 kgm/rpm, the D24 engine still provides a 7% decrease in engine fuel consumption.


Moreover, the DX62R-7 and DX63-7 employ a Load Sensing System that operates on a new Main Control Valve. The mechanism enables a longer spool stroke, thereby enhancing controllability and work efficiency/performance in comparison to the previous models.
Both machines provide an auxiliary flow of 90 litres per minute, which improves the efficiency of work with attachments. The flow capacity can be easily monitored on the Develon Smart 8-inch touch screen in 10 increments and can be controlled using the thumbwheel located on the joystick.




The new cab on the DX62R-7 and DX63-7 features a full glass entry door to maximise operator visibility on this side of the machine from inside the cab. A rear-view camera is optional and the high luminance LED work lamps (which are standard) on the cab further enhance visibility and safety.








The mini-excavators include the latest Develon Fleet Management TMS 3.0 Cellular system installed as standard, which provides a telematics management system for the excavators, by collecting data from sensors on the machines."
09 May 2023,‘Significant’ Q1 growth for Wacker Neuson Group,"But the company admitted that it does not expect to improve on these figures during the rest of the year.
The Germany-based company’s revenue climbed by almost 28% year-on-year to €667.2 million, while EBIT (earnings before interest and taxation) – aided by a one-off sale of fixed assets – more than doubled to €87.8 million.
The EBIT margin of 13.2% was also considerably higher than the 7.5% achieved in 2022.
“As anticipated in our annual guidance, we have carried the full momentum from previous quarters into the new fiscal year and continued to grow significantly,” said Dr Karl Tragl, chairman of the executive board and CEO of the Wacker Neuson Group.
“At the same time, we continue to expect the first quarter to also be the strongest of 2023.” r
As in previous quarters, all three reporting regions contributed to growth in the first quarter with big increases.
In the Europe (EMEA) region, revenue rose by 22.4% €504 million compared to €411.6 million in 2022, with particularly positive growth in Germany.
On the product side, demand for excavators, wheeled loaders and telehandler increased noticeably.
The Americas region grew by 57% to €142.6 million, with a particular sharp year-on-year increase in the USA and further growth in Canada and South American markets.
Asia-Pacific region posted a lesser increase, by 7.3% to €20.6 million, driven primarily by the Australian market with products adapted to the needs of the local market and the focus on independent rental companies continuing to generate strong demand.
By contrast, the Chinese market continued to prove difficult and declined in the first quarter.
Speaking on supply chains after the group’s net working capital ratio fell from 31.9% to 30%, CFO Christian Burkhard said: “We are are still a long way from a normalisation of the situation.
“However, the continued increase in inventory levels paid off in the first quarter as we systematically exploited our growth opportunities. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that effective working capital management remains at the top of our agenda.”"
04 May 2023,Back to the future at Metso as Outotec dropped from company name,"Metso merged with Outotec in the summer of 2020 and the combined business has since acquired companies including Tesab and McCloskey International.
Yesterday, the sustainable technology specialist announced operating profits of €197 million (US$217 million) for the first quarter of 2023 after a 22% year-on-year increase in sales revenue.
Metso Outotec’s Executive Team has been renamed as the Metso Leadership Team.
“After the successful integration of Metso and Outotec, we will focus on growing a strong unified Metso company and brand,” said president and CEO of Metso, Pekka Vauramo.
“We have combined two valuable companies into one strong Metso.
“Our focus is clear: we continue enabling sustainable modern life and transforming the industry with a clear strategy and strong culture, supported by a name that is short yet established and well recognised among all our stakeholders.
“Services are an extremely important part of our business, requiring a strong name.”.
The company said that Outotec continues as a product brand and carries significant value as the name of some key technologies and products.
The change of the parent company name to Metso Corporation is effective from today, but globally the change will be implemented in a phased manner."
02 May 2023,7 things we learned from Caterpillar’s latest trading update,"

Last week saw Caterpillar unveil a strong performance for the first quarter of 2023, driven in large part by growth in North America.
Sales in its construction industries division increased by 10% to US$6.7 billion, while operating margin in the segment was 26.5%.
Here’s seven things we learned about Caterpillar’s performance, what it says about the wider construction industry, and where it could be heading:

Caterpillar reported better equipment availability thanks to improving supply chain conditions. But “pockets of challenge” still remain, particularly for large engines which could impact some of its larger machines.
In general, the supply chain improvements meant that Caterpillar was able to make stronger-than-expected shipments in North America, which is Caterpillar’s most constrained region as far as dealer inventory is concerned.
Caterpillar noted that there is now improved availability of its excavators. That has come about as a result not just of the lower pressure on supply chains but also because of a slowing of demand in China.
Caterpillar said it expected China’s above 10t excavator industry to remain below 2022 levels this year due to low construction activity, while its sales in China would be below the typical range of 5-10% of total Caterpillar sales in 2023.
The better availability of some types of machine in turn means that Caterpillar expects dealers to scale back their levels of inventory in the second half of the year, even though overall demand remains healthy.
The second half of 2022 saw dealers build their inventories to the tune of $1.4 billion. Talking to analysts, Caterpillar chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby said, “We are not planning for this trend to repeat [in the second half of 2023]. Instead, we expect to see dealers decrease inventories compared to the first quarter levels and end 2023 about flat relative to the end of 2022.”
Caterpillar’s overall adjusted operating profit margin for the period was 21.1% and hit 26.5% in the construction industries division. In a call with analysts, chief financial officer Andrew Bonfield explained that while Cat’s manufacturing costs did increase, they increased by less than the company anticipated.
Better-than-expected sales volumes meant factories could operate more efficiently, while freight costs were also lower. Meanwhile, the average price Caterpillar was able to charge for machines was higher than it had expected. These factors combined to boost the company’s profit margins.
But Bonfield said he did not expect the favourable effects of absorbing costs to last in the second half of the year, with margins in the remaining quarters of the year expected to be lower than the first quarter as the relationship between price and manufacturing costs normalized.
The US government has pledged to pump billions of dollars into infrastructure investments through measures such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BiL), which it is claimed involves up to $550 billion in new spending.
Umpleby confirmed that Caterpillar had started to see the positive impact of those infrastructure dollars in orders.
Speaking to analysts, he said, “The projects that don’t require a lot of permitting, things like resurfacing roads, have already started and we’re seeing the positive benefit of that.
“When customers believe there’s a pipeline of projects coming, they’re more likely typically to make that capital investment, to make a purchase of a new piece of equipment. It has started and we expect it to continue for some time.”
Caterpillar said it expected business activity in Europe, Middle East and Africa to increase in 2023 as compared to 2022. While that was down in large part to particularly strong construction demand in the Middle East, and while uncertain economic conditions remain, the company noted that European construction was “more resilient than we previously anticipated”.
When it came to mining equipment, Umpleby said he expected healthy demand, driven by the transition to new forms of energy. He noted that commodity prices remain above investment thresholds and said he expected production utilization levels to remain elevated.
He added, “We also expect the aging of the fleet and a lower level of parked trucks to support future demand for our equipment and services. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for profitable growth.”

02 May 2023,New 120 tonne XCMG AT crane for Europe,"



Chinese manufacturer XCMG has a new 120 tonne capacity all terrain crane for sale in Europe.
XCMG said the 120 tonne rating is calculated at 2.5 metres radius. At 3 metres the crane lifts 80 tonnes.
The XCA120 E on its four axle carrier has a 66 metre boom in six sections. An 11.65 to 18.5 metre, offsetable bi-fold swingaway jib can be added. Putting a pair of 7.1 metre lattice extensions in between the end of the boom and the swingaway gives a maximum tip height just beyond 96 metres. Maximum working radius is given as 60 metres.
An MTU diesel engine powers both the carrier and the crane upper. It has a ZF TraXon transmission with 12 forward speeds, driving the three rearmost axles. A retarder is also standard as is all wheel steering. XCMG said it has independent suspension “similar in overall concept to that used by Grove.”
Depending on tyre choice the crane’s overall width can be kept down to 2.75 metres. Overall length is given as being just over 14.3 metres.
Including their fully retracted position, the outriggers can be set at five spread widths: 3.83, 5, 5.9, and 7 metres. Maximum total counterweight is 33 tonnes, made up from eight slabs to allow multiple configurations.
June sees the official unveiling of the XCA120 E at the JDL Expo crane, transport and aerial work platform show in Beaune, France.

26 April 2023,Haulotte posts ‘historic’ revenues across the board,"France-based lift manufacturer Haulotte has reported “historic consolidated revenues” for the first quarter of 2023, amounting to €196.3 million (US$213.5 million).
The figure represents a 43% increase on the €135.8 million ($150 million) it achieved for the same period in 2022, and keeps the company on track to achieve its predicted 20% growth for 2023.
“All of the Group’s activities showed an increase compared with Q1 2022,” said Haulotte. “The sale of equipment is up by +48%, the rental business by +7% and finally the service business by +15%.”
These percentages equate to respective 2023 revenues of €172.6 million ($190.6 million), €5.8 million ($6.4 million) and €17.9 million ($19.7 million).

While the prediction takes into account a strong historic order book, the company describes the aerial platform market as “dynamic” and says that pressure on the components supply chain is continuing to ease.
Regionally, the company saw the biggest growth in North America, where the uptake of aerial platforms is continuing to rise.
“Haulotte confirmed the results seen in previous publications and posted growth of +72% in the first quarter, largely driven by the aerial work platform business, which more than doubled compared to the same period last year.”
The Latin American and Asia-Pacific regions both saw first quarter sales grow by 38% compared to the same period last year and “In Europe, sales were up by +35% in the first quarter, driven by all markets except for Russia, which is at a standstill”.

26 April 2023,Engineering firm converts 1.6t excavator into disaster rescue robot,"

Forth Engineering, based in Cumbria in the UK, has built a remote-controlled ‘rescue robot’ designed to be sent into disaster zones and controlled remotely.
The machine is based around a 1.6t JCB compactor excavator platform.
It is tetherless and can be controlled from a safe location up to 150 metres away.
It carries a 700bar rescue tool, a grapple hook to move obstructions, a hopper to disperse sand to contain spillages, and an affixative spraying system to contain a nuclear spillage.
The robot has already been trialled at Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria and Forth is now looking it rolling it out to other plants across the UK.
Mark Telford, Forth’s managing director, said: “The Rescue Robot is a pioneering development which has already been successfully tested in hazardous environments, and it has been manufactured to offer a safe, remotely operated alternative to sending humans into disaster zones.
“By working with Sellafield Ltd, we were able to prove the machine is able to withstand some particularly dangerous conditions, and its various adaptations and capabilities mean that this will be a real asset to the UK’s nuclear industry.
“There are endless amounts of modifications and end effectors which can be included on the robot, and we are excited to be able to provide a product which will make working in nuclear plants across the country much safer, while also saving industry a substantial amount of money.”
“Sellafield Ltd required the development of a 1.6 tonne robot, but we are able to adapt the product to any size and also fit it with any type of tools or end effectors to fit the nature of the project.
“What is extremely exciting to us is that it can also be adapted to work in any industry, and it is a real game changer in reaching some of the most dangerous environments found in sites across the UK.”"
25 April 2023,Online exclusive: Rokbak investigates electric and hydrogen-powered articulated trucks,"The idea of articulated trucks that can carry a payload of 30 tonnes being powered by electric power might seem far fetched but it is a possibility that the company Rokbak is looking into. Paul Douglas, Managing Director of the articulated truck company – which is part of the Volvo group – says that they are investigating all possibilities.

“Our trucks will have to be zero emissions somehow. The question is: what does that look like?” comments Douglas. “Electrification using battery technology that you can see today is a stretch for these big products because these are big power demand for long hours of usage.”
As Douglas says, electric power probably isn’t the best source for trucks due to how large they are and their work cycles – it isn’t uncommon for trucks to be run for 20 or 22 hours a day. “We are looking at hydrogen internal combustion engine and fuel cells to provide the electricity using hydrogen. These are technologies that Volvo is working with on their own highway truck and bus solutions.”
Douglas is originally an engineer and the challenges of cutting emissions and alternative power sources clearly excites him. He makes the point that, with technology developing at a rapid rate, no one in the construction industry can confidently state what the future will hold for power.
“It is easier to electrify the smaller stuff,” he says. “But there’s a lot of learning that comes from that. And you know, I can’t keep up with battery technology. It’s moving so quickly. Every six months battery capabilities seem to grow almost exponentially. I don’t know where it will all end up, but I think it’ll be a combination; some products will be batteries, some will be hydrogen fuel cells, and some will be hydrogen internal combustion.”
The last 18 months have been a boom time for both rigid and articulated haulers with numbers the highest they have been for around a decade at around 9,000 units a year. Part of this is due to pent up demand that followed the Covid-19 pandemic added to governments around the world investing in large infrastructure projects although Douglas believes that this is likely the peak of the market.
“We all felt at 8,000 units worldwide, that would be the peak. Then we said the same thing at 8,500, but now we are over 9,000 units. When I look around specific markets, we can see the slowdown coming, such as in Europe. I think we’re probably at the peak now. How long will that hold? Most of 2023 will probably level out [at current levels] although we could start to see a downturn in the second half of the year. It’s very strong at the moment, so we need to capitalise on that as much as we can.”
One of the markets that has driven this growth is North America, which Douglas says accounts for over half of Rokbak’s sales. In terms of smaller markets that have seen good growth he highlights Indonesia and the UK where the HS2 high-speed train project has played a key role in generating demand.
The brand of Rokbak has been around now for around 18 months following the name change from Terex Trucks. Douglas says that a huge effort went into this and that the response from the industry has been very positive. “The reception of it has been fantastic, first and foremost with our own dealer network because we were asking them to move from the old name to Rokbak. But they’ve gone with it, they’ve got a positive feel about it, they’ve invested into. The attraction that we’re getting from people that want to be on this journey with this, inquiries about becoming our dealer, has been really good.”
Talking about the dealer network, the change that we spoke about at the start of this article, from diesel powered trucks to alternative powered trucks, will impact dealers in more ways than one. First, they will be selling a different product and secondly there are different demands and opportunities with this.
“Your dealer partners, the people that sell and support the product – this is going to be a new adventure for them as well,” he says. “It’s new technology for them. An electric drive product probably gets less wear parts, less servicing and spares opportunity. That’s going be a real challenge for the traditional dealer. Their business model’s going to have to evolve.”
Equipment manufacturers have reduced emissions to meet different standards around the world and are now investing heavily into the R&D of alternative power sources, all while juggling issues such as rising inflation and a lack of skilled workers. It is a challenge, but Douglas gives off the sense that he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Moving into this new technology, new manufacturing processes are going to be required, new dealer models. There’s a real change, you can feel it in the air,” he says, pausing for breath before adding with a smile, “It’s fascinating.”"
24 April 2023,APEX 2023: a guide to what’s new at Maastricht show,"Unsurprisingly, green energy and digitization will be two focuses of the world’s largest dedicated exhibition for access equipment, taking place in June this year. Manufacturers will be out in force and here follows just a few examples of those.
Dinolift will be addressing all these, alongside electrification and sustainably, by promoting its MyDino telematics software at the show that will partly be demonstrated via mobile phone and tablet.
MyDino comes standard on all units, including the 280 RXTE lightweight boom lift pictured here, introduced from January.

19 April 2023,Small but mighty: The role of mini and midi excavators in modern projects,"Many manufacturers in the construction industry, certainly the larger ones, have expansive product ranges. One of the reasons for this is financial – the more products a company can sell and service the more money can be made – but another one is simple necessity; construction is such a broad industry that it requires a wide selection of equipment.
Out of all the equipment that is used in construction it is difficult to think of one that has grown in popularity quite as quickly as compact excavators such as the mini excavator (machines approximately 0-6 tonnes) and the midi (approximately 6-10 tonnes).
“The first mini excavators were produced in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a tool of necessity in the country’s famously dense and crowded cities,” explains Chris Sleight, managing director, Off-Highway Research. “By the 1980s they were being exported to Europe and North America, but it was not until the early 1990s when Japanese asset prices collapsed and the economy stagnated that these overseas markets became much more important to the sector’s (still predominantly) Japanese suppliers.”
By the late 1990s, Europe had overtaken Japan as the world’s largest mini excavator market, while demand in North America was matching that of Japan by the mid-2000s. However, it was not until around 15 years ago that the popularity of mini excavators became truly established.
“The previous peak in sales was in 2007, just prior to the impacts of the Lehman Bros. collapse and global economic crisis. That year saw just under 185,000 mini excavators sold worldwide. Fast forward to 2021, the latest peak in the mini excavator cycle, and more than 325,000 units were sold,” says Sleight.
Two key factors have driven this growth: compact excavators have increasingly replaced traditional machine types like the backhoe loader in Europe and North America thanks to the attraction of a smaller footprint, full 360-degree slewing and lower prices than backhoe loaders; they have also started to sell in significant numbers in emerging countries. The most notable has been China, where the mini excavator market peaked at more than 100,000 machines sold in 2020.
Timur Abied, utility product manager at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) tells International Construction that mini and midi excavators are among the OEMs fastest growing product segments with more efficient governance of energy being a main driver.
This sentiment is backed up by Cédric Durand, product management director EMEA, Yanmar Compact Equipment, who says that mini and midi excavators have been growing strongly over the past years.
He adds that, “From one year to another the growth can differ from one country to the other but almost all countries had a strong growth.”
Another smaller factor – but still important – behind the growth in the popularity of these machines is the increased use of attachments such as tiltrotators. “The growing popularity of tiltrotators has been a gamechanger for compact excavators, as tiltrotators allow an excavator operator to tilt and twirl an attachment 360 degrees,” says David Caldwell, national product manager, Takeuchi-US.
New technology is increasingly being integrated into mini and midi excavators, often from what was originally reserved for larger models. Stephane Dieu, excavators product manager, Europe, Develon (previously Doosan), says that, “With the arrival of our DX-7 range, all of the new mini excavators in the range are now equipped with our DoosanConnect telematics system, which was restricted in the past to only our medium and heavy segments – 14 tonne and over in the excavators. This gives our customers the opportunity to fully monitor their compact fleet.”
Chris Bardas, product manager, Hitachi Construction Machinery, reveals that the OEM’s latest mini and compact excavator are, “equipped with ICT solutions, safety features such as rear- and side-view cameras, and benefit from the Zaxis-6 cab, which is renowned for being highly comfortable and spacious, with an ergonomic seat and user-friendly controls.”
Wacker Neuson’s Klaus Allerstorfer, product manager, excavators, agrees that, increasingly, features are being added to mini and midi excavators that in the past were only for bigger models.
“Overall, more and more features are now being integrated into smaller models that were previously only used in larger models,” he explains.
“By features, I don’t just mean hardware, but also digital and data-driven solutions. One example is our EquipCare telematics solution, which makes it easier for our customers to manage their fleets and keep track of the condition of their machines.”
Electric powered equipment is a major trend in construction, especially in compact machines such as mini and midi excavators which many believe are more suited to this type of power than larger machines.
As is the case with many OEMs, Hitachi Construction Machinery has recently launched new electric models in this segment (ZX55U-6EB mini and ZX85-6EB compact) as has Takeuchi, with the all-electric TB20e.
Caterpillar, the world’s largest OEM, announced last year that its construction industries division was working on four new electric equipment machines, including the 301.9 Electric Mini Excavator powered by a Cat 48V, 32kWh battery with a run time of up to eight hours on a single charge.
Another new electric model is Bobcat’s 2-tonne mini-excavator the E19e – an electric version of the E19 internal-combustion model. It offers zero emissions, low-noise operation and comparable levels of performance to its diesel-powered counterpart.
The Bobcat E19e features the same profile and external dimensions. It features a 3.5-hour battery capacity and can be recharged quickly using a super-fast charger, meaning that, by topping up the power during work breaks, the machine can be used all day for the majority of typical applications.
Scott Park, Doosan Bobcat CEO, commented, “With the introduction of the E19e, Bobcat has expanded its larger-size electric line-up of zero emission and quiet machines that can match the excellent performance of our conventional models.”
Volvo CE has been at the centre of the development of electric powered construction equipment, with the OEM introducing its first electric compact models back in 2019 and now offering three compact electric excavators and two compact wheeled loaders. Volvo CE’s Abied says that the company are not just looking at compact equipment though, adding that, “While we started with electric mini excavators, we have also grown into the development of mid-size solutions such as our EC230 Electric excavator.”
While larger excavators may be increasingly electrified in the future, the focus is clearly on compact equipment such as mini and midi excavators.
A key point that OEMs make is that, as well as the benefits of electric power such as no emissions, no noise, no vibrations (thus a more comfortable environment for the operator), one thing is key: performance is just as good, if not better, than with diesel models.
Bardas from Hitachi sums it up by saying, “One of the main advantages of our zero-emission mini and compact excavators, the ZX55U-6EB and ZX85U-6EB, is the high level of performance they provide. No compromises have been made in terms of performance and they have been designed to provide similar levels of performance as diesel alternatives. The fact that they are zero-emission and quieter than diesel models are additional benefits.”
Despite all of the benefits that electric power brings, there are also challenges. Arguably the biggest one is the bottom line. To put it simply, electric machines are considerably more expensive than their diesel counterparts.
“When it comes to battery-powered solutions, the purchase price can be a hurdle,” admits Allerstorfer from Wacker Neuson. “But if you look at the total cost of ownership, the e-machines score with very low maintenance and operating costs, which in turn convinces many customers. In addition, we have found that renting the machines can help to quickly overcome initial doubts.”
Durand from Yanmar agrees that the higher cost is putting off some, but also makes the point that the total cost of ownership over the life of the machine can be less. “Indeed, the purchase cost is still higher than with traditional ICE machines. In the long run this price premium should decrease, and we are looking into the total cost of ownership as well which, at the end, is certainly the best criteria for profitability,” he says.
Another issue is undoubtably with charging and infrastructure. If construction is taking place on a remote site and not in a city then there may not be a power source to charge the battery. At the moment there are no universal standards regarding charging hardware and protocols.
“The lack of charging infrastructure and the still slower pace of introduction is a challenge and we need all stakeholders to help deliver the ecosystem required to support our electric machines and, in doing so, together achieve the strategic objectives of the Paris Agreement,” says Volvo CE’s Abied.
“High energy costs and the lack of financial and legal incentives also hamper deployment of strategic initiatives supporting electric power as the competitive solution for mini and midi excavators.”
When it comes to charging solutions increasing numbers of companies are producing fast charging options and there are other options, such as Wacker Neuson’s ‘charging box’.
“We are not only focusing on the development of zero emission products, but are also looking at entire construction site solutions,” says Allerstorfer.
“We will soon be launching our Charging Box, a mobile power bank for the construction site. This will enable customers to charge their zero emission products easily – and above all independently from local power sources.”
While electric mini and midi excavators are growing in popularity, the number of models sold are very small compared to diesel models. So, what’s next for these diesel models? More new technology being integrated into them that makes the life of an operator easier, and was previously reserved for larger machines, is one trend that will continue.
“These newer technological features all have one thing in common – they’re designed to help operators stay comfortable and more productive,” says Caldwell from Takeuchi US.
“They also help ensure that operators know exactly how their machines are performing by providing a great deal of information at their fingertips.”
In Wacker Neuson’s newest excavator, the wheeled EW100, Allerstorfer says that, “Digitisation played a major role in the development of this machine. For example, we have implemented an intelligent attachment management, a state-of-the-art Human-Machine-Interface, and the preparation for various assistance systems for process optimisation.”
Regarding sales around the world, mini and midi excavators are expected to continue to see strong numbers, if perhaps not at the same levels as in recent years.
Mini excavators are machines which replace manual labour. With the economic driver of rising labour costs (plus the difficulty in finding workers ) added to the fact that the purchase cost for these machines is cheaper than ever, adoption will continue.
“Drivers like these are at play in emerging markets, and the large-scale mini excavator industry which has sprung up in China means that machines are more affordable now than they were before,” says Off Highway Research’s Sleight. “This will help drive the adoption of this type of compact equipment around the world in the years to come.”
It will be interesting to see just what technology and power sources these mini and midi excavators of the future are equipped with as standard."
19 April 2023,"Second 3,000 tonne capacity Huisman giant crane for Havfram","
Havfram Wind has ordered its second 3,000 tonnes-plus capacity Huisman crane for offshore wind turbine installation.
Dutch crane and heavy engineering specialist Huisman will supply the Norwegian installation contractor with the giant leg encircling crane (LEC). Installation will be on the second new NG-20000X wind turbine installation vessel. This order follows the first, placed in mid-December 2022, for an identical crane which was the 13th LEC order for Huisman since 2021.
At the same time, Havfram ordered the second new NG-20000X vessel, on which the crane will be installed, from CIMC Raffles in China. It is designed by GustoMSC in the Netherlands and CIMC Raffles. The new vessels with their 3,000 tonne LECs will be able to install turbines with rotors up to 300 metres in diameter and monopile foundations weighing 3,000 tonnes to a water depth of 70 metres.
Huisman’s fully electric LECs for Havfram will have 155 metre booms and a lifting height around 180 metres above the deck. It is designed to be lightweight and reliable, with high positioning accuracy and energy efficiency in operation. Deck space is maximised by the short tail swing design. Its segmented slew bearing is designed for easy inspection and maintenance.
Speaking about the latest order David Roodenburg, Huisman CEO, said, “We are grateful that Havfram have placed their trust in us to also equip their second innovative new build vessel with a Huisman crane. They are constructing some of the world’s most energy efficient, hybrid-powered wind turbine installation vessels. We are proud that with the two crane orders, we can contribute to boosting wind energy production as well as further improving energy efficiency to reduce Havfram’s carbon footprint.”
Commenting on his choice of crane Håkon Johannessen, Havfram Wind engineering manager, said, “We are pleased to have Huisman supplying cranes for our newbuild wind turbine installation vessels. Huisman’s track record and willingness to tailor their already proven leg encircling crane design to fit the requirements of Havfram and the market has been key to ensuring we have the right tool for the tasks that lie ahead.”
Like the first unit this second crane will be built at the Huisman factory in Zhangzhou, China.

17 April 2023,IRE 2023: what equipment will be on show?,"Since the last edition of the International Rental Exhibition (IRE), it would be an understatement to say that plenty of innovation has taken place among manufacturers, driven by the demand for compact equipment, alternative power and environmentally friendly solutions.
The show will bring an array of those OEMs together under one roof to display just some of the latest launches and developments in construction equipment and technology, as well as aerial platforms through the APEX show, which is being held in conjunction with IRE.
With a wide range of equipment on show - more than 200 companies combined are exhibiting at IRE and APEX - here is a preview of what visitors can expect to see at IRE 2023.
The role of sustainability and low-emission equipment has continued to increase in recent years, and that theme will be highlighted at IRE as Sany will show the electrically driven SY19E mini excavator.
The machine, which the company says delivers zero pollutant emissions and significantly lower noise levels, comes with an electric motor that delivers a peak output of 15kW and an accumulator pack that lasts for an entire working day on one battery charge.
Charging the machine is made possible with a fast-charging station via DC in 1.5 hours, at a public AC charging station in 2.5 hours or overnight at a 220V socket.
Case Construction will highlight its CX15 EV 1.3 tonne mini excavator. Powered by a 16kW electric motor, the machine features retractable tracks that reduces machine width to 790mm and a load-sensing hydraulic system that is said to allow the operator to dial the machine into each task.
The 21.5kWh lithium-ion battery is charged either by the 110V/220V on-board charger or via an external rapid charger that can fully charge the machine in 90 minutes and can last up to an entire working day depending on the work, while its minimum swing radius design is said to make working close to structures and obstacles easier.
From its range of electric and low-emission machines, Yanmar will display several future-ready machines at IRE.
First up is the SV17e electric mini excavator prototype. Designed for the 1.5 to 2.0 tonnes segment, the unit is powered by an all-electric drive and has an open-centre hydraulic system with load-sensing hydraulic pump.
The SV17e delivers 23.5kWh gross electric power, while its 48V air-cooled motors provides “impressive digging, lifting and carrying capabilities,” according to Yanmar.
Another Yanmar prototype on show will be the V8e electric compact wheel loader with 40kWh battery capacity, hydrostatic drive and high-lifting capabilities.
The machine has an 800l loading bucket, 11kW charging in standard configuration and 22kW in optional fast charging.
Joining the SV17e and V8e is the C08e tracked carrier and ViO33 zero tail swing excavator.
With an 11.5kWh battery and a power capacity of 24V, Yanmar says the compact C08e has the “ultimate power and manoeuvrability to excel in tight spaces,” while the ViO33 is said to offer “true zero tail swing” and an “ultra-quiet and efficient engine” designed with low emissions in mind.
Launched in 2020, the eDingo 500 electric compact utility loader from Toro will make its European tradeshow debut at IRE having undergone several upgrades over the last three year’s.
An electric version of the Dingo 323, the machine produces zero engine-exhaust emissions and less noise thanks to its HyperCell Power System, a new lithium-ion battery system developed by Toro.
On its stand, Tobrocco Giant will show its latest line of electric loaders with the G2700E X-TRA, which is an electrically driven version of the powerful G2700 diesel series, and the G2200E X-TRA.
Both loaders are equipped with an 48V LPT-battery and have a pulling force of 12.500N. Optionally the battery can be charged at a car charging station. Said to be ideal for rental, the machine is described by the company as compact and easyily transportable.
Elsewhere on its stand, the company will show its GP1950E electric vibratory plate and the GR740E vibratory rammer.
JCB will show its latest innovations in zero-emissions technology and demonstrate its role in the move towards a cleaner, low-emission future for construction and rental equipment with its growing range of JCB E-TECH electric machinery.
The JCB 19C-1E - the world’s first electric mini excavator will take centre stage, the company say.
The machine is said to produce zero exhaust emissions at point of use and is “considerably quieter” than a standard machine.
Four lithium-ion batteries provide 20kWh of energy storage – enough for full working shift for many mini excavator customers on a single charge.
Also new will be a 2 tonne capacity E2000 electric site dumper from HG Machines in Denmark. This machine follows on from the ultra-compact 1 tonne capacity machines launched by the company in 2016. See more on this machine here.
The newly launched Archy rental platform from Gorman-Rupp Europe will be officially launched into the international market at IRE.
The platform aims to deliver “faster, easier and more reliable” pump rental by using a 10-step pump selector that can advise which pump is needed for specific projects.
It then suggests which pump will be ideal for the user and details how to reserve, rent and manage the pumps as well as all the rental pricing.
Gorman-Rupp say 100s of pumps will be available on the tool, including booster pumps, centrifugal pumps, diaphragm pumps, high pressure centrifugal pumps, pump hoses and submersible pumps.
Another new launch on show at IRE will be the Task Manager web application from Volvo CE. The worksite management tool, which is currently available in the North American market, is designed to connect people, machines and projects to ensure activities are delivered “on target, on time and to budget,” according to Volvo CE.
Swepac will show a line-up of reversible plates it is launching as part of its Battery One concept range.
The FB200B has a 4.6kWh onboard battery, 3.0kW IPM synchronous motor, 550mm wide base plate, while the larger FB300B has a 6.6kWh onboard battery, 10.0kW IPM synchronous motor and 600mm wide base plate.
The large onboard batteries enable them to reach sufficient running time without re-charging.
Users can monitor the progress of projects, set targets, track material on sites and manage data from mixed fleets in real-time. The data collected by Task Manager is then made accessible via mobile or laptop.
Spartan Solutions will debut its PHALANX V6 software platform that aims to streamline the process of equipment rental operations.
The platform utilises artificial intelligence (AI), expert rules and statistical algorithms to identify patterns and trends in equipment’s telematics and operations data. This data includes information about the performance, operation, maintenance, and usage of a machine.
Once the data is collected, the AI engine can detect any abnormalities or issues.
Launched at Bauma 2022, the HBOX+ Hybrid lighting tower will be presented by Himoinsa.
The tower combines a battery-powered system and Stage V diesel engine that is said to reduce noise and carbon footprint while keeping the 120,000-lumen light capacity of its diesel counterpart.
The HBOX+ Hybrid includes LFP batteries (Lithium Phosphate) that have been designed for a lifetime of 6000 cycles, while also offering four different working modes.
The HBOX+ Hybrid incorporates 4 x 350W LED spotlights and an LED Dimming Control which means the tower can start-up with dimming.
Himoinsa will also demonstrate the 45/60 model (60kW/h) of its EHR battery-powered generator which comes with its HICORE System.
Described as a compact, clean product, the generator can operate as a single source of power generation for as a recharging station for electrical construction machinery, as well as allowing integration with gas and diesel generator sets.
Vistors to the Briggs & Stratton stand will be able to see its newest Vanguard battery products and engine solutions.
The products on display include the Vanguard Si 1.5kWh Swappable Battery and the new Vanguard 400 EFI /ETC Single Cylinder (pictured).
The company says it developed the cylinder by working with OEMs to provide a “tailored power solution, that caters to each OEM’s specific requirements within the rental market.”
Generac Mobile will display the VT-Solar, a generator-free lighting tower with three solar panels that can recharge its built-in battery pack.
The tower is available in two versions, a manual-mast and hydraulic-mast version, which comes with higher battery capacity, powerful solar panels (400W each) and four LED floodlights with adjustable light power.
Exhibiting alongside Generac Mobile, Pramac will display its GRW Hybrid generator, which it describes as an efficient, reliable unit that reduces operational expenditure, with a choice of available operating modes that allow the correct selection according to site specifications.
Trime will present the X-SOLAR 4x60W LED lighting tower fitted with four 60W LED lamps.
The company says it is built to be robust, with galvanised metal works, and powder coating finish.
The zero-emission tower also has optional features, including a telemetry system for remote location and operational monitoring, an automatic start-up PIR operation, and dimmable lighting.
Elsehwere, ItalTower will exhibit its Street Solar lighting tower that it launched last year.
The tower with a 60W solar panel produces 6,000 lumens and has a lithium battery pack with a capacity of 14.8V.
Paclite will display its concept edging trowel, the M600.
Powered by a Vanguard engine, the new concept 600mm machine has been developed together with Cramo Sweden and is said to be ideal for rental due to its ABS fly wheel, which ensures concrete does not stick to the trowel.
Paclite says it will launch new versions of the M900 and M600 later this year, powered by a long-lasting battery-charger & motor.
Taking place from 6-8 June, IRE will be held at the MECC centre in Maastricht, the Netherlands, alongside APEX, the European Rental Association’s (ERA) annual Convention and the European Rental Awards.
