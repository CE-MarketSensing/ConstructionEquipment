Liebherr presents the new LH 26 M Timber Litronic at LIGNA 2023 in Hanover,Press releases |05/15/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-presents-the-new-lh-26-m-timber-litronic-at-ligna-2023-in-hanover.html,Liebherr will unveil the new LH 26 M Timber Litronic for efficient timber handling at the world's leading trade fair LIGNA in Hanover.Find out more,Press releases,05/15/2023,"With the LH 26 M Timber Litronic, Liebherr will present a new timber truck to the public at LIGNA that extends its existing portfolio to include a lighter machine with an operating mass of between 23,500 and 26,000 kg. Liebherr will also showcase its new, integrated tyre pressure monitoring system as part of its trade fair exhibit. This system allows the desired target tyre pressure to be set and monitored on the display in the operator's cab. The system will be optionally available for Liebherr material handlers from October.Liebherr's trade fair exhibit also includes a straight 6.6 m long boom and a 5 m long stick with an angled stick end as well as a Liebherr type GM 10B wood grapple with a capacity of up to 1.30 m². The machine configuration also includes the 1.2 m high, rigid cab elevation LFC 120 for optimum visibility and a 3 m wide support blade at the rear. Maximum splash protection is provided thanks to the hot-dip galvanised mudguards, which also serve as a platform for easy and safe access to the operator's cab.The new machine combines high driving performance with compact dimensionsThe engine power of 125 kW / 170 hp provides the system with a large amount of torque, which allows the machine to accelerate quickly. In combination with the high pump flow, this guarantees fast, dynamic work movements and therefore maximum handling capacity.Thanks to its compact design, the new machine is ideal for use in confined spaces. It’s extremely small front and tail swing radius enables the machine to turn around completely even in very narrow operating locations. The minimal contours of the right front side enable the machine to work very close to sorting lines or timber stacks as it is always within the width of the undercarriage. This ensures an excellent view of the working area, ensures additional safety and prevents collisions.Four-wheel steering for greater manoeuvrability and integrated tyre pressure monitoring systemTo ensure excellent manoeuvrability and agility, the LH 26 M Timber is equipped with four-wheel steering as standard. The four-wheel steering increases driving stability and thus improves the machine's directional stability. The automatic steering reversal, which is also standard, guarantees the correct steering direction at all times, when travelling both forwards and in reverse.To allow the operator to keep an eye on the tyre pressures, the machine features Liebherr's new integrated tyre pressure monitoring system. The desired target tyre pressure can be set on the display in the operator's cab. If the current tyre pressure deviates from the set target pressure, a warning is shown on the display. The integrated monitoring system not only increases safety, but also results in increased driving comfort as well as reduced tyre wear.Optimised undercarriage concept with efficient travel mode for trailer operationThe electric pivoting angle adjustment in the travel motor provides additional torque, maximum acceleration and a higher drawbar pull. This ensures a consistently good driving performance even on inclines. Optimal adjustment of both the engine speed and flow rate ensures impressive fuel efficiency even at top speed.For longer distances, the combination of a material handler and trailer is the optimal choice. The powerful travel drive and robust axles enable the machine to tow trailers with a weight of up to 60 tonnes.The 3 m wide undercarriage and rear support blade give the machine a high degree of stability during handling operations, which also means the load capacity can be further increased; for example, when loading and unloading the trailer. This enables more timber to be handled during each cycle to increase productivity. The support blade can also be used for clearing work and thus increases safety in the timber yard.. Downloads.

New Liebherr L 580 LogHandler XPower® makes its début at Ligna 2023,Press releases |05/15/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-liebherr-l-580-loghandler-xpower-makes-its-debut-at-ligna-2023.html,"Liebherr will exhibit a new version of the L 580 LogHandler XPower®, the special wheel loader for the timber industry.Find out more",Press releases,05/15/2023,"The L 580 LogHandler XPower® is based on the standard version of the Liebherr L 580 XPower® wheel loader. It has many of the advantages for which the XPower® wheel loaders are renowned, in particular, the XPower® power-split travel drive, which Liebherr installs on all XPower® models as standard. With its high performance, low fuel consumption and a final speed of 40 km/h, the L 580 LogHandler XPower® excels during short loading cycles as well as over long distances. Responding to customer requests, Liebherr has adopted multiple equipment options from its standard wheel loaders for the new L 580 LogHandler XPower®. For example, the active personnel detection, an innovative assistance system to increase safety and the steering wheel-free operator's cab with convenient joystick steering.Productivity in timber work with new lift arms and optimised grappleThe special wheel loader's lift arms consist of a newly designed swivel arm and an optimised boom. The new swivel arm has no components which could impair visibility. It is designed so the view of the grapple, the logs being transported, the woodpiles and the vehicles to be loaded remains unobstructed. Liebherr has reworked the geometry of the boom so the machine operator can move the grapple laden with logs optimally and with more power in all directions, even at great heights. The stroke limit damping thereby ensures a gentle movement to the end positions of the working hydraulics, which reduces jolting and extends the components' service life.The new lift arms on the L 580 LogHandler XPower® are notable for other intelligent solutions. For example, the machine operator can program individual lift arm positions on the touch display in the cab. Recurring work procedures can therefore be repeated automatically and safely, increasing convenience when handling logs. The electrohydraulic pilot control and angle sensors are the technical foundation for this. Together with other pressure sensors, they ensure that the optional weighing system can weigh the load in the grapple at any time. An indicator in the display, which provides information on the machine's stability enhances this weighing system.The new, optional grapple monitoring system, including a camera fitted on the boom, also increases safety. It provides a direct view of the working attachment and transmits a live image on an additional display in the operator's cab, improving visibility for the machine operator. In the rework process, Liebherr has also adapted the grapples, which have a capacity of up to 4.0 m². These are greater than on previous models and are optimised for easy loading. Their claws are wider than before to make log transportation more stable and safer. The grapple, which can be rotated 360° and allows logs to be manipulated in all directions, ensures maximum versatility.Convenience and safety in the timber yard with XPower® operator's cab and assistance systemsThe spacious cab on the L 580 LogHandler XPower® is a safe and convenient workspace for the machine operator. The interior is logically designed and storage options and control elements form an ergonomic unit. The multiple hydraulic functions of the lift arms and grapple, and the travel direction can all be precisely controlled with one hand using the Liebherr control lever, which moves with the operator's seat. Other functions can be easily operated using the state-of-the-art, height-adjustable touch display or the buttons positioned near the control lever.In the design without the steering wheel, the operator's cab is generously proportioned and the steering column is also omitted. In this case, customers must have their L 580 LogHandler XPower® fitted with the optional joystick steering when ordering. Joystick steering allows the operator to steer easily with just one hand. This makes working more pleasant because intensive turning of a steering wheel is replaced by short movements on an ergonomically designed joystick. The position of the joystick always corresponds to the machine's respective articulation angle. With force feedback on the joystick this ensures intuitive and safe operation, even at high speeds and on challenging terrain.Other innovative equipment is also available on the new L 580 LogHandler XPower®, like active personnel detection. This optional assistance system, which is installed at the rear, warns of dangers to the rear of the machine both visually on the display and with acoustic signals in the cabin. In order to provide a specific warning of imminent injury to people, the assistance system independently distinguishes between people and objects using smart sensors. As soon as active personnel detection emits a warning signal, the brake assistant automatically reduces the machine's speed. This eliminates the human reaction time required for conventional braking. This shortens the stopping distance by crucial metres, further reducing the frequency and severity of accidents and making the timber yard safer.. Downloads.

ISO Limited and Liebherr advance New Zealand timber,Press releases |05/10/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/iso-limited-and-liebherr-advance-new-zealand-timber.html,"Liebherr and ISO Limited have been building on a long partnership to drive innovation in New Zealand’s forestry industry. The outreach began in 2018, and after careful planning and due diligence, the delivery of MHCs and SMAG grabs have been operating since 2020. The delivery is considered a “lighthouse project” that other locations are analysing to expand and improve their own operations. The LHM 550 has a 51-metre lifting height and an outreach of 54 metres. The electric-hydraulic grapples feature a world-first in terms of size and capacity at 35 tonnes and 9.0 m², respectively.Find out more",Press releases,05/10/2023,"Innovation never rests. To support the sizeable lumber industry in New Zealand, Liebherr Maritime Cranes has worked with ISO Limited, a Qube company, and SMAG to develop a state-of-the-art timber handling solution for the ports of Tauranga and Gisborne. This project marks a significant milestone for the forestry industry in New Zealand and demonstrates Liebherr’s commitment to delivering innovative solutions that drive efficiency and safety in maritime operations. The project began in mid-2018. Following customer meetings in Tauranga and Gisborne, Liebherr had a clearer picture of the project’s requirements.In September 2019, a customer meeting was held at the Liebherr Rostock manufacturing plant, with the first test of the SMAG electric-hydraulic grapples, and a contract was signed for four LHM 550 and six SMAG timber grabs. A crane simulator to assist with training of crane operators was also part of the purchase for Tauranga. In January 2020, a successful second grab test was completed with a new bucket design, and production of the six grabs was released. By Q1 2020, the crane simulator had been delivered and installed at the customer’s site. In mid-July 2020, the four fully assembled LHM 550 mobile harbour cranes and six timber grabs were loaded onto the ship “Rolldock Sun” and arrived in Tauranga in early September 2020. In addition, a further contract was signed for two more LHM 550 and three more SMAG timber grabs. They arrived at Eastland Port - Gisborne November 2021. All units have been handed over to the customer and are in operation. Turnover has been increased by as much as 35%.A “lighthouse project” for one of New Zealand’s leading industries“The new MHCs have significantly changed the way logs are loaded in New Zealand and most importantly are a significant step-change to our current practices, improving both safety and productivity,” states Paul Cameron, Director and CEO at ISO Limited.Not only has this project opened up great potential for further shipments with ISO, but other companies have also expressed interest. The concept of more efficient and safer ways of handling timber is proving to be an attractive option for many. Forestry is a significant industry in New Zealand, contributing to an annual export revenue of around $6.8 billion, 1.6% of New Zealand’s GDP, and to the employment of around 35,000 people in production, processing, and commercialisation. Innovations in this field are therefore of great relevance to many people, and Liebherr and its partners will continue to collaborate closely on forward-looking options to support safe and efficient ways of operating in the timber industry..

These machines are optimally designed for jobs such as loading and unloading trucks and trailers, log sorting and transport. For these tasks, good driving performance, high payloads and fast working cycles are the order of the day. Whether working as a material handler, wheel loader or telescopic handler, these machines are equipped to drive quickly and manoeuvre nimbly while handling raw materials precisely and delicately; for example, during gripping and sorting work. Liebherr will exhibit four of its special-purpose machines at LIGNA.Wheel loader for increased productivity in timber handlingLiebherr will present a new version of its L 580 LogHandler XPower®, a specialized wheel loader for the timber industry, at LIGNA 2023. This machine is based on the standard version of the Liebherr L 580 XPower® wheel loader and provides many of the now familiar advantages of the XPower line-up; chief among them, the power-split XPower travel drive. The upgraded model features numerous optimisations; for example, on the lift mast and the associated grapples, which were specially developed for log handling.For flexible work in the timber yard, the modified mast allows manipulation heights of up to seven metres and a reach of almost four metres. Some design-related adjustments, especially to the basic boom, have also resulted in improved visibility. These innovations will enable operating companies to move more cubic metres of wood per hour and thus increase their productivity. The new L 580 LogHandler XPower® is available now from Liebherr sales partners.Liebherr will also showcase the L 538 as a representative of its new series of medium-sized wheel loaders, which it has recently redeveloped and fundamentally revised. The redesigned mast, which ensures the highest possible breakout, holding and retrieval forces, features optimised Z-kinematics and improved working hydraulics. With their increased engine power and tip loads, these wheel loaders are ready for a wide range of demanding operations in various industries. The latest innovations enable faster cycle times and dynamic and powerful working movements – even with heavy attachments such as high-tip buckets or wood grapples.New Liebherr LH 26 M Timber Litronic material handlerThe new LH 26 M Timber Litronic will also be on show at LIGNA. Thanks to its extremely compact design and exceptional manoeuvrability, this specialist handling machine is ideal for use in sawmills and lumber yards where space is at a premium.

W.L.L. is considered to be one of the largest marine operators in the Gulf region with a fleet of over 150 units consisting of various sizes and types of tugs, barges and other equipment.Find out more",Press releases,04/28/2023,"Al Jazeera Shipping Co. W.L.L. has been active in both the maritime and the offshore and oil industries for over 45 years. The main activities of the company include chartering tugboats, supply boats, accommodation and work barges, as well as leasing offshore construction equipment. The company also has its own marine fabricating yard to carry out the associated repair and maintenance jobs. It covers an area of over 80,000 square metres with 300 metres water frontage and is adjacent to the Mina Salman Port area.Back in early 2022, Mr. Ali Hasan Mahmood, Managing Director of Al Jazeera Shipping, commonly known under his alias “The King of Barges”, expressed his desire to renew one of his used older generation crawler cranes. This led him to various suppliers and his attention was caught by the latest addition to the Liebherr crawler crane range, namely the 400-tonne LR 1400 SX. Apart from the crane’s superior load curve and safety ratings, Mr. Ali Hasan’s decision to go with Liebherr was mainly driven by the model’s short assembly time, its preselection feature of individually customized load charts and, in particular, its capability to preselect barge inclinations, which automatically applies the permitted load curve. The LR 1400 SX has just recently been commissioned and will be working on several projects with Bapco and its refinery in Bahrain beginning in May 2023.“We are proud to be the first company in the Gulf to receive the Liebherr 400-tonne crawler crane model LR 1400 SX. Hopefully more Liebherr crawler crane purchases are to come with the assistance and full cooperation from Liebherr. A great association,” says Ali Hasan Mahmood.. Downloads.

Liebherr cranes at work on Europe's first CO2-neutral thermal spa in Milan,Press releases |04/27/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-cranes-at-work-on-europe-s-first-co2-neutral-thermal-spa-in-milan.html?page=2,Thermal waters will soon be bubbling where horses were once kept: Europe’s first CO2-neutral thermal spa is under construction in Milan’s San Siro district.Find out more,Press releases,04/27/2023,"Moving concrete buckets, placing formwork, and lifting steel parts: the top-slewing cranes are involved in various tasks for the spa’s shell construction and renovation of the historic stables in the north-west of Milan. Built between 1915 and 1918 in Art Nouveau style, the De Montel stables quickly became one of Italy's most prestigious equestrian centres. Decline set in following the Second World War and the facility increasingly fell into disrepair.Flexible jib lengthsA 125 EC-B 6 flat-top crane with a six-tonne maximum lifting capacity is now helping shape a new beginning. The crane features a 50 metre-long jib and has a freestanding hook height of 30 metres. A 240 EC-B 12 Fibre with a freestanding hook height of 44 metres and a 65-metre long jib is also in use, delivering a maximum lifting capacity of twelve tonnes.Thanks to their reach, the two flat-top cranes, which also have intelligent assistance systems for efficient and safe lifting installed, can comfortably reach all corners of the construction site. Jibs from the EC-B series can be accurately adjusted to site requirements using two-and-a-half-metre sections.Fibre rope advantagesThe “Fibre” part of the 240 EC-B’s name stands for Liebherr’s pioneering fibre rope technology. Fibre cranes achieve significantly higher performance values compared to their steel rope counterparts. Fibre rope is also more durable, easier to handle when reeving due to its lighter weight, and maintenance is less complicated as lubrication isn’t required. And a further advantage: crane operators are able to see at a glance when the fibre rope needs changing. The components of the rope’s cover wear out at different rates – a red layer indicates that the rope has reached the end of its service life. This increases safety during operation.Italy’s largest city spaThere are thermal water springs running underneath the construction site, some 300 metres below the ground. So, the area is ideal for a thermal spa. Italy’s largest city spa primarily stands out because of its sustainability focus. The spa is designed to produce no CO2 emissions during operation. Its owners have opted for a whole package of measures, such as photovoltaic systems, solar thermal panels, connection to a district heating network, the reuse of rainwater, and the recovery of energy from waste.Optimal overall packageThe construction company Techbau S.p.A, based in Castelletto Sopra Ticino (NO), purchased the cranes for this project through Liebherr dealer Niederstätter. “We chose Liebherr cranes based on the professional advice we received from Niederstätter. The 125 EC-B 6 and 240 EC-B 12 Fibre flat-top cranes are perfect for this project on account of their design, lifting capacity and reach,” says Techbau project manager Mario Corrias. Niederstätter is also providing support in terms of crane maintenance and servicing. The cranes are scheduled to be dismantled towards the end of 2023, subject to progress on site.. Downloads.

Three LR 1700-1.0 cranes for Canada – GUAY reinforces crawler crane fleet with Liebherr 700 tonne models,Press releases |04/27/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/three-lr-1700-1-0-cranes-for-canada-guay-reinforces-crawler-crane-fleet-with-liebherr-700-tonne-models.html?page=2,Canadian crane contractor GUAY has ordered three LR 1700-1.0 crawler cranes from Liebherr.Find out more,Press releases,04/27/2023,"""We are seeing a strong increase in demand for new wind farms in our market. The government is investing large sums in green energy to meet the growing demand. We need to invest in larger crawler cranes as wind turbines get heavier and taller"", said Executive Vice President Guillaume Gagnon, explaining the company’s purchase of the three LR 1700-1.0 cranes.The new Liebherr cranes will reinforce the Canadian crane specialist's fleet and deliver the highest hoisting heights in the fleet. GUAY mainly plans to use the 700 tonne models in wind farms, but they will also be used in industry and for construction work. ""We will now be able to erect wind turbines up to 165 metres in height and the maximum hook height of 196 metres will enable us to work on tall buildings,"" Gagnon added. ""We chose the LR 1700-1.0 to be able to provide our customers with a state-of-the-art crane for their future wind projects. After completing our research, the high lifting capacity and small footprint proved to be the perfect combination for us. Compared to larger crawler cranes, the transport costs for the LR 1700-1.0 are lower due to the perfect weight and size of its components.""Economical transport and innovative crane technologyThe LR 1700-1.0 from Liebherr combines the benefits of economical transport from crawler cranes in the 600 tonne class with the performance of lattice boom cranes in the 750 tonne class and all the innovations featured in Liebherr’s crawler crane developments from the last few years, such as VarioTray and V-Frame. VarioTray is a small counterweight frame that can be unbolted quickly and easily as required. This eliminates the need for tiresome stacking and unstacking of counterweight plates. The V-frame ballast system is a hydraulically adjustable folding frame which enables the ballast radius of the LR 1700-1.0 to be infinitely adjusted between 13 and 21 metres. A rigid ballast guide system is thus no longer required for large radii.Gagnon continued: ""The V-Frame increases the crane’s capacity and flexibility to do all the work we have planned. VarioTray saves us time when working on wind power projects because we only need a lot of counterweight to erect long boom configurations. We have been working with Liebherr for a long time. We like the fact that Liebherr continually creates innovations that drive the industry forward. The LR 1700-1.0 is the latest model in this crawler crane class and it will also meet the requirements of the future thanks to its state-of-the-art crane technology.""GUAY is one of the largest privately owned crane companies in Canada and North America, with more than 20 outlets in the province of Quebec and will see it celebrate its 60th anniversary next year. Jean-Marc Baronet founded the company in 1964 and is still its owner and president at the age of 92. His goal has always been to continue to deliver new solutions to his customers by investing in new technologies and larger equipments. Today, the company employs around 625 people and operates over 500 cranes of various types.. Downloads.

Liebherr power for the energy transition,Press releases |04/21/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-power-for-the-energy-transition.html?page=2,The transport of wind power from the coastal regions to the south of Germany is an essential point for the success of the energy transition and the transformation towards renewable energies.Find out more,Press releases,04/21/2023,"The energy transition project with the somewhat unadorned title ""Wahle-Mecklar"" has it all: 555 mighty electricity pylons have to be erected over a length of 230 kilometres. Only a very small part of the route will be bridged with underground cables. The new power line, which runs through the federal states of Lower Saxony and Hesse, is scheduled for completion in 2024 after a total of four years of construction. Several Liebherr mobile cranes are being used to erect the pylons, which are up to 90 metres high. Albert Regel GmbH, headquartered in Baunatal near Kassel in Hesse, regularly sends equipment from its modern fleet to the pipeline construction site.Extremely long telescopic boom - usually no jib required""When it comes to mast construction, the crane of choice here is clearly our LTM 1230-5.1,"" reports Daniel Stawizki, dispatcher at Regel. ""With its 75-metre telescopic boom, the mobile crane can manage almost all of these jobs without the aid of a jib. We only use a 32-metre fixed jib on the crane for the largest of the up to 90-metre high overhead line pylons. A few times we have also sent out our 300-tonne LTM for this.""Most of the time, Regel's LTM 1070-4.2 flanks the crane work on the future power line. It handles the individual lattice tower elements on the ground and lends a hand when the components have to be brought into a vertical position for assembly together with the large mobile crane. This compact, modern 70-tonne mobile crane can carry most of its ballast on the road. Moreover, due to its active and speed-dependent rear-axle steering, it is virtually predestined to easily reach the work sites in the terrain and to be ready to pull within a very short time.For three years now, Regel's cranes have been moving out to the construction sites of the grid operator Tennet in phases. ""We have definitely already erected well over a hundred of the electricity pylons,"" reports Stawizki. ""If everything works out, the completed lattice tower will be up within a day in the evening."" The company has also already had an LTM 1200-5.1 in action together with an LTM 1090-4.2 as a team on the construction sites along the route.At the company's headquarters in Baunatal, Regel operates around 40 mobile cranes together with a depot near Fulda. With the exception of five machines, they all come from the Liebherr factory in Ehingen. In addition to crane work, Albert Regel GmbH also offers heavy transport as well as machine and industrial relocations.. Downloads.

Premiere in the Port of Rostock: Sarens takes delivery of the first Liebherr LR 12500-1.0 crawler crane,Press releases |04/20/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/premiere-in-the-port-of-rostock-sarens-takes-delivery-of-the-first-liebherr-lr-12500-1-0-crawler-crane.html?page=3,The crane and heavy lifting company Sarens took delivery of the first unit of the new Liebherr LR 12500-1.0 crawler crane at the Port of Rostock on 1 April.Find out more,Press releases,04/20/2023,"For Sarens, the high capacity of the new Liebherr LR 12500-1.0 was the decisive criterion in purchasing the 2,500-tonne crane. Carl Sarens, Director Technical Solutions, Projects & Engineering says: ""The capacity of the LR 12500-1.0 is enormous. Operations in the renewable energy sector, such as here in Rostock, are a particular focus for the crawler crane. The handling of offshore wind turbines in ports is becoming more and more important and the individual weights of the components are constantly increasing. The initial assembly of the new crane worked very well.""During the symbolic handover of the keys to the LR 12500-1.0, Sophie Albrecht, who is responsible for the mobile and crawler crane division within the Liebherr Group, among other things, mentioned an interesting detail: ""Today would have been the 108th birthday of my grandfather and company founder Hans Liebherr.""Sarens has given the new crawler crane its own name and dedicated it to a long-time employee: ""Straffen Hendrik"". The Flemish word ""straffen"", meaning strength, goodness, robustness, characterises the experienced employee Hendrik Sanders. He has been working for the Belgian company for more than 30 years and is responsible for large cranes as a project planner.In the port of Rostock, the LR 12500-1.0 will lift 50 monopiles with a diameter of up to nine metres, a length of up to 90 metres and a weight of more than 1,400 tonnes into the water in tandem lifts with a Liebherr LR 1800-1.0 over a period of about eight weeks. Including load handling attachments, the two cranes have gross loads of up to 1,750 tonnes to move. The monopiles, huge foundations for offshore wind turbines, will then be pulled afloat to a special ship, which will then take them to the Baltic Eagle offshore wind farm, which is currently under construction. It is located about 30 kilometres north of the island of Rügen.. Downloads.

It is very nice to operate such a machine for the last few years.” Mats Andersson operates the piling rig LRH 100.1 unplugged on the jobsite in Karlstad, Sweden and is pleased to “avoid exhaust and noise emissions, and vibrations” with it. It is the first application and endurance test for the battery-powered piling rig from Liebherr.A building complex with flats, offices and shops on the ground floor is being built in Karlstad. In order to transfer the load of the building into load-bearing soil layers, Hercules Grundläggning AB is driving piles into the ground with the LRH 100.1 unplugged. “We are installing 284 piles with sizes of 270 x 270 millimetres and lengths between 15 and 20 metres.”Flexible for all piling conditionsThe LRH 100.1 unplugged excels with its large working range. A radius of up to 8.7 metres has the advantage that the machine does not have to be constantly moved. The design of the leader enables inclinations of up to 18° in all directions. Furthermore, it is also possible to raise or lower the leader by 4 metres (e.g., when working in a foundation pit), which makes the machine even more flexible.For the piling work, Hercules Grundläggning AB has equipped the LRH 100.1 unplugged with a Liebherr hammer type H 6. The hammer is modular and can be used with drop weights of between 3,000 and 6,000 kilogrammes, depending on requirements. At the jobsite in Karlstad, Mats Andersson drives the piles into the soil with a 5,000-kilogramme weight from a drop height of 40 centimetres.“Here, we are using a free-fall hammer, i.e., it is not accelerated. We only compensate for the power loss with the cylinders. This has the advantage, especially when driving concrete piles, that these are not damaged so much as when using accelerated hammers,” explains Liebherr’s Product Manager Michael Rajek.Depending on the length of the pile, between 800 and 1,500 strokes of the hammer are necessary for each one. In only 10 to 20 minutes, Mats Andersson can lift the pile and drive it into the soil. “The control system is designed in such a way that the operator can now adjust the pile-driving energy and the number of strokes independently of each other, and thus ideally adapt to the conditions.”The hammer used by Hercules belongs to the latest generation in the series. “We have more or less changed the whole architecture of the existing H 6 hammer. The new steel construction is specially designed for stiffness, longevity and for reliability.” The noise reduction on the jobsite due to the battery-powered piling rig was also continued with the new hammer. “We have a soundproofed pile helmet and pile helmet guide.” Due to the redesign of the hammer, the noise emission has been reduced by about 35 per cent.Performance, safety and zero emissionThe electro-hydraulic drive of the LRH 100.1 unplugged has the same performance specifications as the conventional version. Both are operated in the same way, which is especially convenient for machine operators if they often have to switch between machines.The Ground Pressure Visualization of the new piling rig calculates the current ground pressure in real time and compares it with the specified safety limits of the relevant jobsite. The ground pressure is displayed in the operator’s cabin. This means the operator is permanently aware of whether the machine is situated in, or is approaching, a critical area.One exceptional feature of the electric drive concept is Zero Emission. The unplugged machines of this series do not produce any exhaust fumes and are extremely quiet. This strikes the right note especially in noise-sensitive regions and finds favour with construction site personnel like Mats Andersson.The battery is charged using a conventional jobsite electric supply. “That was no problem at all,” Mats Andersson is pleased to say. Operation can continue as normal while charging. In order to change to battery operation, you just need to pull out the plug, therefore: unplugged. Whether attached to the electric supply or not, the performance and range of application remains unchanged.. Downloads.

Fast-erecting crane from Liebherr works on former castle in historic old town ,Press releases |04/19/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/fast-erecting-crane-from-liebherr-works-on-former-castle-in-historic-old-town.html?page=3,"Narrow streets and closely lined buildings lend historic old towns a very special charm. But when construction work needs carrying out, this can quickly turn into a challenge. Narrow access routes and limited space require exactly the right crane for the job.Find out more",Press releases,04/19/2023,"When it came to selecting a crane for the project, contracting authority Bamberg City Council placed great importance on the machine being able to cover all the renovation work required. The highest point on site is a 36-metre-high tower. Plus, the crane needed to be as compact as possible for transport and operation given the tight access routes and limited available space on site. Bamberg City Council took its specifications to the crane specialists at BKL Süd. The solution: an 81 K.1 from Liebherr.Flexible hook heights and jib lengthsThe bottom-slewing crane can be flexibly adapted to local construction site conditions with eleven carefully graduated hook heights and five different jib lengths. This makes hook heights between 17 and 40 metres and jib lengths between 31 and 48 metres possible. The crane was configured with a hook height of just under 39 metres and a reach of 48 metres for the historic building's renovation. As a result, the machine can reach all parts of the construction site with ease. The 81 K.1 offers a maximum lifting capacity of six tonnes and a jib head load capacity of 1,350 kilograms with a 48-metre jib.Despite its considerable hook heights, the fast-erecting crane is extremely compact in transport, measuring just 16 metres in length and 2.5 metres in width. Thanks to these dimensions, the machine is easy to manoeuvre and can be delivered to site without the need for a special permit. The crane’s agility also proved useful when approaching the site due to the narrow access routes available. As the 81 K.1 is delivered as a compact, complete unit, it can be assembled straight away once on site and without the need for extra resources. Given the nature of the ground near the river, the crane was positioned on a three-metre-thick, 9 x 9-metre concrete foundation.Partner for a variety of liftsThe crane has been involved in various different tasks for the historic building's comprehensive renovation since August 2019, including the repair of roof trusses and rooftops, interior demolition and remodelling work, as well as the renovation of ceilings and façades. The aim is to restore the building to its former glory and to meet statutory standards regarding fire protection and accessibility. Geyerswörth Castle as it stands today was completed in 1588/89, making it a prominent feature of Bamberg’s historic city centre for near to five hundred years. The building is also home to the Renaissance Hall, one of the city's most prestigious historic venues.The crane is expected to be on site for another one to two years. In cases like this, when a machine is in use for so long, an automatic centralised lubrication system is an ideal add-on. It lubricates the ball slewing ring at set intervals and simple handling ensures that the crane has a long service life. Another advantage of the 81 K.1 is its small slewing radius of 2.75 metres. This allowed the fast-erecting crane to be positioned directly at the former castle building, enabling other site vehicles to pass through the narrow inner courtyard without any problems and making optimal use of the crane’s reach. Intelligent assistance systems in combination with precision drives ensure safe and accurate crane operation.Well thought-out solution concept“The crane meets the customer's renovation work requirements perfectly and is the most cost-effective crane solution for this project,” says Martin Fischer from BKL Süd, based in Forstinning. BKL Baukran Logistik GmbH specialises in the sale and rental of cranes along with related services. Its crane fleet includes over 500 construction cranes ranging from 22 to 90 metres in radius, more than 100 mobile cranes from 30 to 700 tonnes, and 15 mobile construction cranes with a radius of up to 65 metres. Liebherr’s K series fast-erecting cranes, from the 34 K through to the 125 K, also form an integral part of the fleet.. Downloads.

Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1: Reinforcement for Pergamo Sollevamenti,Press releases |04/19/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-ltm-1650-8-1-reinforcement-for-pergamo-sollevamenti.html?page=3,The new LTM 1650-8.1 from Pergamo Sollevamenti S.r.l. will be the crane and heavy transport company's most powerful crane.Find out more,Press releases,04/19/2023,"The crane and heavy haulage company Pergamo Sollevamenti S.r.l. has taken delivery of a new LTM 1650-8.1. With a lifting capacity of 700 tonnes, it will be the strongest crane of the Italian family-owned company. ""We chose the 700-tonne crane to increase the maximum lifting capacity of our fleet and to be able to serve the needs of our customers"", says Managing Director Antonio Pergamo. The long telescopic boom was particularly convincing. The 8-axle crane offers a length of up to 80 metres.LTM 1300-6.2 in service for wind energyPergamo Sollevamenti has already been able to gain good experience with a Liebherr LTM 1300-6.2 since the end of 2020. The 300-tonne crane is used by the Italian company in the wind energy sector, among others. It has carried out repair work on an 80-metre-high wind turbine at a wind farm in the Italian region of Molise. The old generator had to be removed and a new one installed. The 6-axle unit with its 78-metre-long main boom and a 12.5-metre-long folding jib was equipped for this.Liebherr mobile cranes: versatile in use""Our Liebherr cranes play an important role in our crane fleet because of their versatility"", declares Francesco Pergamo. VarioBase® allows for requisite flexible support. This increases the safety and lifting capacity of Liebherr cranes. The LTM 1650-8.1 also features the VarioBallast®. The ballast radius can be infinitely varied between 6.3 and 8.4 metres with a simple hydraulic swivel mechanism. The small radius offers advantages in tight working environments. With a large radius, the crane reaches its maximum load capacities. The LTM 1300-6.2 and LTM 1650-8.1 also feature high mobility and short set-up times.Purchase of further Liebherr cranes already planned""We decided to purchase the Liebherr mobile cranes because we value sustainability, digitalisation and efficiency when renewing our fleet. Liebherr is the world's leading manufacturer of telescopic cranes"", says Anna Pergamo, explaining the decision in favour of Liebherr mobile cranes. ""We already plan to purchase more Liebherr cranes"".For more than 20 years, the family business Pergamo Sollevamenti S.r.l. has been mainly active in the wind power, petrochemical and industrial sectors. The management is jointly in the hands of the father Antonio Pergamo and his children Francesco and Anna Pergamo.

"Liebherr presents the LR 1700-1.0W, the most powerful narrow track crawler crane on the market",Press releases |04/18/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-presents-the-lr-170-1-0w-the-most-powerful-narrow-track-crawler-crane-on-the-market.html?page=3,Liebherr has unveiled the successor to its successful 600-tonne LR 1600/2-W narrow track crawler crane.Find out more,Press releases,04/18/2023,"Narrow track crawler cranes are optimised for use on wind farms: they can travel from one turbine to the next along the existing routes and be deployed very quickly. Liebherr developed the first narrow track lattice boom crawler crane 20 years ago, the LR 1400/2-W. However, in the intervening years wind turbine towers have become taller and wind power components heavier. For this reason, Liebherr launched the significantly more powerful LR 1600/2-W back in 2010, of which around 50 units are currently in operation worldwide. However, assembly of the latest generation of wind turbines now requires cranes with an even higher lifting capacity.The LR 1700-1.0W is the successor to the successful LR 1600/2-WJust as the LR 1700-1.0 replaced the LR 1600/2 in Liebherr's line-up almost two years ago, the narrow track version of the 600-tonner is now also being replaced by the new 700-tonne LR 1700-1.0W. The company's successful crane concept has thus been continued: Liebherr has designed a narrow crawler travel gear and a new centre section with star support for the existing slewing platform. The boom systems from the standard crane can be adopted to a large extent. At 5.9 metres, the crawler travel gear is only 10 cm wider than its predecessor. When driving, the supports are folded forwards and backwards.The biggest differences to the predecessor model, the LR 1600/2-W, are the new crane's significantly higher lifting capacities and greater lifting heights. The basis for this is a more powerful basic machine as well as the 3.5-metre-wide H-lattice type sections in the lower area of the main boom, which increase the lateral stability of the entire system. Comparing the longest wind-turbine boom with the derrick system on the predecessor model (156-metre main boom plus 12-metre lattice type fixed jib) with the new crane with the same boom length results in a 64 per cent increase in lifting capacity (from 73 to 120 tonnes). In addition, the new LR 1700-1.0W can be built up higher: with derrick system plus 15 meters, without derrick system plus 6 meters. The new crane thus meets the more challenging requirements of working on modern wind turbines with hub heights reaching 170 metres. Liebherr also offers the LR 1700-1.0W with a luffing jib. This option was not available for its predecessor.State-of-the-art crawler crane technologyThe V-frame and VarioTray have more than proven their worth on the LR 1700-1.0, LR 1800-1.0 and LR 11000 crawler cranes. Therefore, the narrow-gauge variant of the LR 1700-1.0 also receives these innovative systems. The ""VarioTray"" is a small counterweight frame that can be unbolted quickly and easily as required. This eliminates the need for tiresome stacking and unstacking of counterweight plates. The V-Frame ballasting system is a hydraulically adjustable folding frame that allows the ballast radius of the 700-tonne crawler crane to be adjusted continuously between 13 and 21 metres. A rigid ballasting system is thus no longer required for large radii. These innovations offer great advantages, especially for wind turbine assembly.The new narrow track crane also gets the LR 1700-1.0's modern lattice type fixed jib, which can lift up to 170 tonnes and is designed for both single and parallel operation. Limited rope length is no longer an issue because two winches can work simultaneously over the jib. A particularly wide hook block prevents twisting. To save weight, the whip line is integrated on the head section.Powerful drive trainSince crawler cranes – and especially narrow track models – have to cope with longer distances and inclines on wind farms, Liebherr's designers have placed a special focus on maximising the performance of the new LR 1700-1.0W's drive train. It therefore includes components designed for the crawler cranes in the next higher load class. The powerful drive of the new Liebherr narrow track crane raises driving and steering to a higher level while reducing wear. The 4-way drive for the travel gear is standard equipment, as are the two-metre wide crawler pads.. Downloads.

Liebherr-Werk Bischofshofen GmbH launches state-of-the-art logistics centre,Press releases |04/18/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-werk-bischofshofen-gmbh-launches-state-of-the-art-logistics-centre.html?page=3,"After just two years construction work, a new logistics centre was put into service in April in Bischofshofen, Austria.Find out more",Press releases,04/18/2023,"The investment of around € 26 million includes a state-of-the-art automated warehouse with space for over 12,000 pallets and over 33,500 small load carriers, generous logistics and office space and a photovoltaic rooftop installation to generate electricity. “This year, we will produce another record number of wheel loaders. Our unit numbers have more or less doubled in the last six years. The new logistics centre is an essential part of the infrastructure necessary to meet the continually rising global demand for Liebherr wheel loaders in the future”, explains Peter Schachinger, Director of Production and Operations at Liebherr Werk Bischofshofen.With the new logistics centre, Liebherr is also creating an exciting work environment for skilled jobs in logistics. Innovations such as modern operating materials, ergonomic lifting devices and automated material flows reduce physical strain for staff. They optimise working conditions for employees and also make it easier for workers from other industries to enter the profession. “I am particularly pleased that we could add another apprenticeship to our wide range of options: to become an operation logistics specialist”, Schachinger adds.New logistics centre: more efficient processes and more jobsThe automated warehouse, which is designed as a fully automatic high-bay warehouse, is the heart of the new logistics centre. Its massive storage capacity and the automation of complex storage processes help make optimal usage of the limited factory space. For example, the material flow from receipt of goods to the station at which the tugger trains are prepared for delivery to the assembly line can extend over multiple storeys in the new building complex. A practical and special feature is the innovative storage technology which automatically moves the goods onto trolleys after order picking. This removes the need for complicated manual intermediate steps, for example using a pallet truck, before the new tugger trains deliver the prepared material to the assembly lines.“These innovations in our intralogistics help us to handle the increasing material flows and make our processes even more efficient. The growth in automation will not put any jobs at risk, but will in fact create additional attractive jobs”, says Schachinger. The fields of work are diverse, from logistics planning, warehouse and goods administration to in-house transportation and plant technology.

Liebherr has significantly strengthened the LTM 1750-9.1 in 2020 with an 800-tonne upgrade. ""We plan to use our new crane for tasks that cannot be done by 500-tonne mobile cranes and are not economical for crawler cranes due to the high transport costs,"" explains company owner İsmail Kuşgöz.Maximum mobility and short set-up timesThe 9-axle all-terrain crane is designed for particularly short set-up times with maximum mobility. It can transport its complete telescopic boom on public roads. ""The dimensions of the luffing jib make it easy to transport. What's more, the 800-tonne crane makes it easier to assemble and disassemble,"" says Kuşgöz. ""Thanks to self-assembly, quick and convenient rigging can be carried out with little space required."" For luffing jibs, Liebherr offers support during erection through an automated process via the LICCON crane control system. The adjusting winch is automatically tracked by the control system when the telescopic boom luffs up.Flexible application possibilitiesFor Kuşgöz İzmir Vinç, it is important to work with the latest and most modern cranes. ""Following the wishes and requests of our customers, we decided to integrate an 800-tonne crane into our fleet,"" Kuşgöz explains. ""The Liebherr LTM 1750-9.1 is a top performer in this class. The compact design and alternative applications thanks to the flexible boom system were important to us when deciding on this crane"".

LTM 1300-6.3 – A powerhouse over the rear ,Press releases |04/13/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/ltm-1300-6-3-a-powerhouse-over-the-rear.html?page=4,Dietmar Floßdorf GmbH & Co. KG was one of the first three crane companies in Germany to put the new Liebherr LTM 1300-6.3 mobile crane into service.Find out more,Press releases,04/13/2023,"""The telescopic section, which is really long at 90 metres, and the super lifting capacity when working over the rear make this new mobile crane very appealing for us,"" says Marco Floßdorf, explaining his company's decision to buy the LTM 1300-6.3. In February, the young company officer and scion of the family business was present when the mobile crane was handed over at the Liebherr factory in Ehingen. ""The new crane will certainly be used on all kinds of jobs at our company and, if necessary, will be a capable assistant to our LTM 1650-8.1.""One of the first jobs on which the modern 300-tonne mobile crane was deployed involved two tandem lifts that were executed with Floßdorf's most powerful mobile crane. Two enormous steel boilers, the heaviest weighing almost 100 tonnes, had to be installed in a new power plant at a paper factory in Düren. Some very cramped conditions and a pipe bridge running between the pre-assembly site and the installation site made the job a bit of a challenge. Originally, the customer planned to use a crawler crane. However, a well thought-out concept designed by Thorsten Mahlberg from Floßdorf's technical field service, which instead involved operating mobile cranes on both sides of the pipe bridge, convinced the client. Mahlberg positioned the LTM 1650-8.1 – equipped with Y-guying and 155 tonnes of ballast – directly in front of the power plant construction site. The LTM 1300-6.3 was used on the other side of the pipes to guide the mighty steam boilers into a vertical position while they were being turned.Taking on a load via the rear supportThe VarioBase®Plus trapezoidal support on the LTM 1300-6.3, one of this mobile crane's many innovative features, provided more than sufficient stability while the two Liebherr machines lifted the huge steel elements from their pre-assembly site. The new crane had to cope with a maximum load of 48.2 tonnes at a radius of 14.3 metres before the large crane gradually took over the load and moved the boilers into a vertical position. Lifting them into the prefabricated steel structure for the future power plant was then the sole responsibility of the LTM 1650-8.1 and its two experienced drivers, Martin Pohl and Martin Holzem.Both men's expertise really became apparent as the heavy steel blocks were carefully inserted into the new building. During this demanding manoeuvre, there was only about a hand's breadth of space between them and the steel construction on the side of the boilers, which were around twenty metres high. These first had to be precisely positioned and then held in place for hours until the enormous load was released following welding work on the structure.Jibs of other LTM cranes are compatibleFloßdorf did not purchase any jibs for its new LTM 1300-6.3. ""If the long telescopic boom is ever insufficient, we can use the fixed or hydraulically adjustable jibs from our other Liebherr cranes,"" said Michael Sadrinna, pointing out the advantageous compatibility of the Liebherr machines. As an active and progressive company – its portfolio includes heavy transport, rental and working platforms – Floßdorf owns a modern fleet of cranes made exclusively by Liebherr. Therefore, there is no shortage of equipment in stock for its LTM units.Indeed, the 90-metre boom of its newly acquired mobile crane will probably suffice for the vast majority of the company's future assignments. Thorsten Mahlberg, Floßdorf's project manager, already has his eye on the new 300-tonne crane for the planned dismantling of a 70-metre-high chimney. ""We could hang a demolition grapple from the hook block on the LTM 1300-6.3, which could then nibble away at the chimney from above. Of course, with its long telescopic boom the crane would be perfect for that."". Downloads.

Liebherr cranes build sustainable office building at Luxembourg Airport ,Press releases |04/12/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-cranes-build-sustainable-office-building-at-luxembourg-airport.html?page=4,"The “Skypark Business Center” currently under construction at Luxembourg Airport is a lighthouse project in terms of office real estate. The new building brings together architecture, functionality and sustainability – and seven flat-top cranes from Liebherr are an integral part of making this happen.Find out more",Press releases,04/12/2023,"“The Skypark project is as prestigious as it is challenging,” says Dany Hanus, responsible for the crane fleet at Skyliners. “Direct service, quick response times and our ability to offer reliable machines are crucial criteria for meeting the strict deadlines on site.”The machines in use are a 172 EC-B 8, two 202 EC-B 10, one 285 EC-B 12 and three 250 EC-B 12 with jib lengths of 40, 45, 50 and 55 metres. All have aircraft warning paintwork. Depending on the model, the top slewing cranes have a maximum lifting capacity of up to twelve tonnes. The highest tower cranes on the construction site are a 250 EC-B 12 and a 285 EC-B 12, each with a hook height of 69 metres. The lowest one, another 250 EC-B 12, has a hook height of 50.4 metres.Few transport unitsThe jib and tower elements in the EC-B series can be flexibly adapted to the conditions on site. This means that several cranes can work together in the tightest of spaces without any problems and that slewing above the runway isn’t an issue. Plus, assistance systems support the crane operators in their work and increase handling performance, reliability and safety. The cranes are equipped, for example, with the fine positioning mode Micromove, the short-term load increase function Load-Plus and the ABB operating range limitation system. Thanks to their optimised transport and assembly concept, it was possible to deliver the flat-top cranes to the building site with just a few transport units and to then assemble them quickly. The first crane was erected in December 2020.Since then, the Liebherr machines have been providing efficient support for structural work. 41,000 cubic metres of concrete, 55,000 cubic metres of wall formwork, 63,000 square metres of slab formwork and 6,000 tonnes of reinforcement were used for the four basement levels. While the area below ground is predominantly concrete, the upper floors are being built with European timber.Milestone for Airport CityUpon its completion at the end of 2023/early 2024, the “Skypark Business Center” will offer approximately 100,000 square metres of space for restaurants, retail, fitness facilities, hotels, offices and a kindergarten. There will also be a multi-storey car park. The building is the first milestone for Airport City, a large-scale development project around Luxembourg Airport.The new building is what is known as a Nearly Zero Energy Building. Wooden construction, photovoltaic systems, rainwater collection, double façades, green roofs and terraces, as well as plenty of natural light throughout, help to keep its carbon footprint, energy consumption and operating costs as low as possible. Sustainability is already factored into the construction phase. Gravel from excavation is being used for the concrete walls and slabs of the parking spaces, which reduces the number of trucks that need to be driven onto site, thereby cutting down emissions.Everything from one sourceThe flat-top cranes will continue to work on the site until the end of 2023. All the cranes are from the rental fleet belonging to Skyliners. The Luxembourg-based company has specialised in the rental and sale of tower cranes for over 25 years and offers its customers a fleet of close to 100 tower and fast erecting cranes, ranging from 26 to 630 metre-tonnes. Experienced service technicians are on hand to assist with the assembly, dismantling and maintenance of the Liebherr machines.. Downloads.

Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 mobile crane dismantles port crane ,Press releases |04/11/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-ltm-1650-8-1-mobile-crane-dismantles-port-crane.html?page=4,French crane rental contractor Foselev SA was asked to dismantle an ageing port crane in Port-La Nouvelle on the Mediterranean.Find out more,Press releases,04/11/2023,"Port-La-Nouvelle, the third largest French port on the Mediterranean, is located between Narbonne and Perpignan and is particularly important for handling wheat, fertiliser, coal and oil. After three modern Liebherr mobile port cranes, one LHM 280 and two LHM 420 models, took over the handling of bulk and general cargo, an ageing double jib crane over 30 m in height was rendered obsolete. It took two weeks to dismantle in February 2023.The port authority commissioned French crane rental contractor Foselev SA with the task. This nationwide rental company employs over 2,500 people and operates a fleet of 920 vehicles, including a large number of Liebherr mobile cranes. Its Foselev Sud Ouest outlet based in Port-La-Nouvelle coordinated the operation.The company's most powerful telescopic crane was selected for the complex job, an LTM 1650-8.1. The crane was perfect for dismantling the crane components in its T5Y configuration. With an 80 metre telescopic boom and Y-guying, the Liebherr 8-axle crane demonstrated all its strengths during this difficult job. The heaviest single component, the counterweight of the double jib crane, weighed 122 tonnes. The job was completed on schedule at the end of February 2023 to the satisfaction of the port authority.Thierry Volatier from the relevant Foselev outlet, which coordinated the crane job, commented: ""To achieve the low support pressure of 6 t/sq m required by the port authority, we had to reduce the surface pressure, so a 21 sq m support plate was placed under each of the four outriggers of the LTM 1650-8.1. The strong wind (Tra Montagne) was a challenge with speeds reaching up to 100 km/h. Although the Liebherr crane is designed and approved to operate in higher wind speeds, we suspended work for a few days for safety reasons.""The Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 mobile crane delivers top lifting capacities on eight axles with telescopic boom lengths of 54 or optionally 80 metres. With lattice extensions, it can achieve lifting heights of up to 152 metres and radii of up to 112 metres.. Downloads.

A career in mining: Thinking outside the box,News |04/11/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/a-career-in-mining-thinking-outside-the-box.html?page=4,"If there is anyone who understands the wide range of ways Liebherr mining equipment can be used to help customers, it is Zack Sims.Find out more",News,04/11/2023,"When Sims joined Liebherr USA, Co. in 2019 he brought with him 10 years’ experience in heavy equipment sales. This experience is invaluable for Sims as he is in direct contact with customers. Sims explains, “I work with our customers to identify the best option for their projects and how to maximise performance and profitability with their Liebherr mining equipment.”The Liebherr Group prides itself on acknowledging and respecting each of its employee’s strengths, talents, and areas of expertise. As an employer, Liebherr knows that its employees are key to its success as a business. The company gives its staff the freedom to act on their knowledge so they can seek out inventive solutions to meet customers’ needs.When customers require something slightly out of the ordinary for their purposes, this is where Sims, his years of experience, and the special applications projects for Liebherr mining equipment can help. Sims says, “The special applications projects are really exciting. They vary from providing the most versatile demolition machines in the world to dredging machines capable of digging at extreme depths while having the ability to build rock jetties along shorelines.”Innovative solutions for customers around the worldIngenuity and creative thinking helped Sims to find an innovative way to use one of Liebherr Mining’s excavators to support one of the largest contractors for energy and infrastructure projects in North America.“We sold an R 9150 with a custom long boom and stick configuration to the customer to help them build rock walls along shorelines,” explains Sims. “The machine was designed with the ability to rotate and tilt the attachment at the end of its stick. This way, rocks could be set at the exact angle and pitch to ensure the solidity of the rock walls.”However, it was not just the R 9150 that Sims and his team needed to focus on.“We also had to coordinate with both the customer and the company that built the barge our machine would eventually be working on. This was to ensure that the vessel provided the stability necessary for the excavator to achieve the reach and lifting capabilities necessary to handle large stones,” Sims says.Continuous innovation is one of Liebherr’s primary driving forces. Employees are encouraged to think creatively to ensure customers are provided with best service and equipment for their circumstances. With its wide range of mining machinery, complemented by 50 years’ experience in designing, manufacturing, and supporting mining equipment, Liebherr Mining has the industry expertise needed to find the right solution for each customer. Liebherr Mining’s international customer service support network also allows the company to provide these solutions to customers in a timely manner, wherever they are.The personal touchThese special application projects provide Sims with unique and exciting challenges. He emphasises that the best part of his job is travelling throughout the USA to attend various exhibitions and meet new people. “Even though attending exhibitions requires a good bit of work setting up booths, coordinating with industry conventions, and plane hopping, most of the shows allow vendors and customers to have a good time making connections and networking,” Sims says.Because of the amount of travel required in his role, Sims has come to appreciate the job stability and culture of respect that Liebherr offers its workforce. “I love that Liebherr remains to this day, a family-run company that cares for its employees. There is a mutual respect, professionalism, and consideration between the company, my colleagues, and myself,” explains Sims."

There are numerous Liebherr sites in the vicinity of Ravensburger Spieleland – from Upper Swabia to Allgäu and Vorarlberg,"" says Iris Beyer, Director of Human Resources, Liebherr-Electronics and Drives GmbH. Ulrich Thalhofer, Director of Human Resources, Liebherr-Aerospace Lindenberg GmbH, adds: ""The playground is also something special for our employees. In many families, entire generations have already worked at Liebherr. At the Liebherr adventure playground, they can show their children what they do at work.""Experiencing Liebherr through playAt the Liebherr adventure playground, a 4.5-metre-long truck mixer with a driver's cab, many play levels and a slide awaits guests. From there, children can go straight to the next highlight, the 2.5-metre-long excavator, via a climbing course. From the excavator shovel, they go over the boom into the interior of the excavator and its driver's cabin. Next door, climbing is the order of the day on the 4.5-metre-long mobile crane with its steep ramp. A view over the entire playground can be seen from the five-metre-high crane with nest swing. The container playhouse next door offers climbing and playing fun on two levels in an original shipping container. An original tyre of a T236 mining truck invites visitors to play hide and seek. A jump on a plate swing directly from a helicopter is also part of the playground. In addition, the variety of products Liebherr develops for the aviation industry can be discovered in the helicopter.In addition to the playground equipment, visitors can learn about Liebherr's wide range of products in an XXL-memory®. There are also knowledge games on the topics of logistics, electronics or Bionics. Young visitors can also immerse themselves in the world of refrigerators and freezers: among other things, with the touchscreen game “BioFresh” about the correct storage and the sustainable handling of food.One year of planning and developmentIt took just under a year from the initial idea to the opening of the Liebherr adventure playground. Different Liebherr product segments were involved in the project. Together, they came up with many different ideas for games and activities. Liebherr apprentices were especially involved in the creation of the playground. Beside ideas for games and wall charts, they made benches in two of Liebherr's apprentice workshops. One resembles the chain-linked crawler track travel gears on which some construction machines move the other is a refashioned part of a concrete pump, that apprentices equipped with wooden seating.To Liebherr-Erlebnisspielplatz"

Liebherr: 2022 business year with new record turnover ,Press releases |04/03/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-2022-business-year-with-new-record-turnover.html?page=5,"The Liebherr Group finished the year 2022 with a new record turnover of €12,589 million.Find out more",Press releases,04/03/2023,"Difficult general conditions, rapidly rising food and fuel prices, as well as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and related regional lockdowns weighed on economic development and slowed economic growth in the past business year. Nevertheless, Liebherr’s turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year. The group achieved increased turnovers in 10 of its 13 product segments, some of them significant. It thus surpassed its previous turnover record from 2021 by €950 million.Turnover in the seven product segments of earthmoving, material handling technology, deep foundation machines, mobile and crawler cranes, tower cranes, concrete technology and mining totalled €8,561 million, 6.9% above the previous year’s level. In the six product segments of maritime cranes, aerospace and transportation systems, gear technology and automation systems, refrigerators and freezers, components and hotels, Liebherr achieved a total turnover of €4,028 million, an increase of 11 % over the previous year.Turnover increased slightly in the European Union, which is traditionally the Group’s strongest sales region. Growth rates in the EU markets varied, with business developing positively in the Netherlands and Italy in particular. Liebherr developed extremely positively in North America and in Central and South America, with strong growth impulses coming from the USA and Canada, and again from Brazil. The Group also recorded a pleasing increase in Africa as well as in the Near and Middle East. Turnover in Asia and Oceania was slightly above the previous year’s level.The Liebherr Group achieved a net income of €2 million in 2022. Operating results and the financial result decreased significantly compared to the previous year. The number of employees grew again in the 2022 business year. At the end of the year, the Liebherr Group had a total of 51,321 employees worldwide. Compared to the previous year, this constituted an increase of 1,710.Traditionally high investments in research and developmentAs a technology company, the Liebherr Group pursues the goal of making a decisive contribution towards technological progress in the sectors relevant for the Group. Last year, the Group therefore invested €588 million in research and development. The bulk of this was used in the development of new products. Numerous cooperative ventures with universities or higher education institutions and research institutes were initiated or continued.Alternative drive technologies continue to be a focal point of the research projects at Liebherr. As part of its technology neutral approach, which takes into account the most diverse areas of application and product requirements of customers worldwide, the Group is working, among other things, on the increased use of hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVO). The fuel, which is derived from renewable energy sources, can be used directly in a large proportion of Liebherr’s construction machinery, cranes and mining machines, thus also significantly reducing CO2 emissions from existing fleets. An absolute novelty is the R 9XX H2: The crawler excavator, which won the Bauma Innovation Award for Climate Protection, is powered by Liebherr’s H966 hydrogen combustion engine and emits almost no CO2 during construction site operation. Liebherr also continued its research into fuel cell systems for the aviation industry. The first of these systems was successfully commissioned in 2022.In the field of electric drives, since the previous business year, Liebherr has added six new models to its Unplugged range, which consists of battery-powered, locally emission-free crawler cranes as well as piling and drilling rigs up to 400 tonnes. Furthermore, the new LTC 1050-3.1 E compact crane is equipped with an electric motor in addition to the conventional drive. Another new development from Liebherr is the Liduro Power Port (LPO) mobile energy storage system for supplying power to hybrid or fully electric construction machinery and equipment on construction sites.Digitalisation was another focal point of the Group’s R&D activities. The new LICCON3 crane control in the LTM 1110-5.2 and LTM 1100-5.3 models laid the foundation for a new, digitised generation of mobile cranes. Among other things, LiTool, a design and simulation program for increased quality of gear cutting tools, was further developed. In the components segment, Liebherr implemented various camera-monitor systems and all-round vision solutions. In concrete technology, the development of a software for control technology, which will be used for collecting and processing data for process optimisation, started. In addition, existing technologies for remote control, automation and networking were optimised in several product segments. Work was carried out, for example, on the Liebherr-Remote-Control (LiReCon) teleoperation system. With it, both cranes and earthmoving machines such as excavators, wheel loaders and dozers can be controlled safely and conveniently from a distance. Liebherr has also made further developments in the area of assistance systems over the past year. Particularly noteworthy is the expansion of the assistance systems for mining trucks to include the Trolley Guidance and Crusher Guidance systems, which increase operating efficiency and operational safety.Investments in production, sales and serviceThe Group invested €863 million in its production sites and its global distribution and service networks. Investments thus increased by €121 million compared to last year. Offset against this was depreciation of €528 million. For example, the Group expanded its sales and service activities on the French market and added the new branch office Liebherr Distribution et Services France SAS, which is located in Taverny near Paris. In the aerospace and transportation systems segment, Liebherr opened a repair workshop in Singapore and applied for an extension of the site in Campsas near Toulouse (France) to expand the manufacture of heat exchangers there. In order to further expand the remanufacturing of used components and thus make an important contribution towards the conservation of resources, Liebherr began the construction of a new remanufacturing workshop at its Jakarta (Indonesia) site. In Austria, Liebherr continued the construction of a new logistics centre at the Telfs site. This is where most of the production material will be stored in future. In Oberopfingen (Germany), construction work was initiated for a new hydraulic cylinder plant, and in the tower crane segment Liebherr is planning an extension to the existing factory building at the manufacturing site in Pune (India). With the opening of the new repair facilty in Ehingen-Berg (Germany), Liebherr took the first step in a large-scale plant expansion at the Ehingen site, which will enable higher production capacities and an optimised service portfolio. All project measures at the repair facility in Ehingen-Berg are to be completed by 2024. Furthermore, the Group invested heavily in emission-reducing and energy-saving measures at various sites in the business year, such as photovoltaic systems, LEDs as light sources, and the further low-emission design of factory traffic through electric drives and the use of HVO.Outlook for 2023The Liebherr Group has started the year 2023 with a positive order situation. With regard to the war in Ukraine, however, there is still great uncertainty as to whether and to what extent a gradual easing will occur, whether the sanctions will remain in force and whether a gas shortage, which would result in rationing, can be avoided. At the same time, there are still macroeconomic uncertainties about the duration and distribution of the expected decline in economic activity in Europe, the duration of broad price increases in many goods and services, and the scarcity of certain raw materials and labour. The same applies to bottlenecks in different supply chains. It is also unclear how fiscal and monetary policy measures will affect the Liebherr Group. Macroeconomically, however, lower inflation may reduce uncertainties and thus increase demand for the ’sGroup’s products and services. Following the successful previous business years, Liebherr expects further growth in turnover in 2023.On Monday, 3 April 2023, the Liebherr Group publishes its current annual report. In addition to detailed figures, it contains a magazine section reviewing the past business year. In an interview, Dr. h.c. Dipl.-Kfm. Isolde Liebherr, Dr. h.c. Dipl.-Ing.

Four aces for BKL: MK 88-4.1 and MK 140 cranes from Liebherr boost fleet,Press releases |03/30/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/four-aces-for-bkl-mk-88-41-and-mk-140-cranes-from-liebherr-boost-fleet.html?page=5,"Liebherr has delivered four new mobile construction cranes to BKL Baukran Logistik GmbH. Two MK 88-4.1 and two MK 140 have joined the company’s fleet at its Munich, Rosenheim, and Frankfurt am Main locations.Find out more",Press releases,03/30/2023,"“With more than 600 tower and mobile cranes available, BKL offers its customers a huge selection of different machines. It’s important that our team is trained and has experience in handling this range so that we can get the best use out of each crane,” says CEO Jörg Hegestweiler. “So, one of the decisive factors for buying the mobile construction cranes from Liebherr was their easy handling, which is similar to that of the LTM series cranes we provide for mobile work.”Experienced MK customerCrane specialists at BKL have been successfully working with machines from Liebherr’s MK series and its time-tested taxi crane concept for over 20 years. Only one person is needed for travel, assembly and operation. Additional transport vehicles aren't required. These features even make jobs with short downtimes cost-effective and are a particular advantage given the current shortage of skilled workers. Mobile construction cranes offer long reaches, have a compact footprint, and can be positioned close to buildings.Typical tasks for the MKs, which BKL deploys across Germany, include green roof installations, steel construction work, flat roof renovations, and roof replacements. The crane rental company’s mobile construction cranes often play unusual roles when customers need crane solutions for special lifting projects. An MK 140, for example, suspended a grand piano complete with pianist as part of an open-air concert. Another MK 140 played a leading role behind the scenes of a new BKL video by moving the lighting and handling HSE-Equipment.Electric operation without emissionsThe four-axle MK 88-4.1 offers a hook height of up to approx. 59 metres (45-degree luffed position) and a maximum radius of 45 metres. It has an eight-tonne load capacity and can still lift as much as 2,200 kilograms at its jib head. Powered by site electricity or another power source, the MK 88-4.1 works without CO2 emissions and is exceptionally quiet on site. This can prove a particular advantage on night-time construction sites. And its hybrid power concept means that operation isn’t limited to one source of power: if an external supply isn’t available, an efficient diesel generator ensures self-sufficient operation.Long reachThe five-axle MK 140 has a maximum lifting capacity of eight tonnes and a jib head lifting capacity of 1,900 kilograms at a 58.5-metre radius. So it offers the perfect solution for when heavy lifting and long reaches are required. The MK 140 is the only machine in the MK series with a three-section telescopic tower of solid wall construction. It also features an infinitely height-adjustable lift cabin, as do the other cranes in the series. The crane operator is able to work efficiently inside thanks to large glass panels, an ergonomic and comfortable control stand, and modern display systems.About BKL Baukran Logistik GmbHBKL Baukran Logistik GmbH specialises in the sale and rental of cranes along with related services. With over 50 years of experience and more than 300 employees in Munich, Ingolstadt, Rosenheim, Frankfurt am Main, Aschaffenburg, Hanover and Hildesheim, the company is one of the largest manufacturer-independent full-service providers of crane solutions in Europe.

Liebherr crane helps renovate historic building ,Press releases |03/30/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-crane-helps-renovate-historic-building.html?page=5,,Press releases,03/30/2023,"“The construction company Iarossi Enrico & C. Sas. bought the L1-32 through us specifically for this project and is especially impressed by its reliability and quiet handling,” says Tania Colatriano, managing director of the local Liebherr dealer Colatriano Group srl. The crane offers a maximum lifting capacity of 4,000 kilograms and a jib head load capacity of 1,050 kilograms at a 30-metre radius. This makes the crane ideal for the construction and renovation of larger detached houses and smaller apartment buildings.Thanks to its clever control and drive technology, crane operation is both easy and efficient. The Speed2Lift function, for example, saves time when handling loads as it automatically selects the maximum speed possible for the load in question. And the assistance system Micromove ensures precise and safe placing. Plus, the crane operator always has all the information they need in view on their radio remote control with graphic display.. Impressive handlingThe crane moved bricks, roof panels, wooden elements and more on the construction site in Italy. “Thanks to its infinitely variable drives, the crane delivered excellent handling performance and was quiet in operation,” says Enrico Iarossi, managing director of construction company Iarossi Enrico & C. The village is located in the heart of the Parco Regionale Sirente-Velino nature reserve. The reconstructed building “Consorzio Palazzo Angelantoni 1700” was built in the 18th century and originally housed one of the first known pharmacies in the region. Today, the building contains a private apartment, guest accommodation and a restaurant.To fully utilise the reach of the bottom-slewing crane with its 30-metre jib, the crane was positioned in the inner courtyard. However, there was only limited space for the crane there. The L1-32's small slewing radius of only 2.2 metres proved helpful here. As is typical for Italian villages, access roads to the site were narrow. Because of its compact wheel spacing and overall length of just 13.3 metres when folded, it was possible to manoeuvre the L1-32 through the streets and back again without any difficulty.. The L1 series“We were totally satisfied with the L1-32 and are already looking forward to its next assignments,” says shareholder Carlo Iarossi. The crane was in use in the Italian village from 2020 to the end of 2022. Compact and powerful – these qualities are perfectly combined in the machines of the L1 series. In addition to the L1-32, the series also includes the L1-24, which offers a maximum lifting capacity of 2,500 kilograms and a radius of either 25 or 27 metres.. About the Colatriano Group and Iarossi Enrico & C.The Colatriano Group srl, based in Città Sant'Angelo (Abruzzen), was founded in 1985. Its core business is the sale and rental of construction machinery in the Italian regions of Abruzzo, Molise and Marche. The company also offers services covering all aspects of construction machinery operation through its qualified service team. The construction company Iarossi Enrico & C. Sas, based in Goriano Valli (Abruzzen) and San Demetrio (Abruzzen), has been active in the construction industry for over 50 years and concentrates on new builds, renovations and the refurbishment of historic buildings, especially in the Abruzzo region.

The normal workload consists of tailing the turbine rotor to the ground, loading/unloading turbine components, and assisting with the assembly/disassembly of the larger Liebherr cranes.“Obviously, Liebherr has always been recognized as an industry leader, but I think the bar has been raised in recent years with regard to customer service,” notes Basden. “When we started our Renewable Energy division in 2021, we relied heavily on the expertise of Liebherr Product Managers Jim Jatho and Beau Pocock. Their knowledge and willingness to help has been vital in our growth.”The LRT 1100-2.1 and LRT 1090-2.1 were both designed with safety in mind. These cranes offer multiple safety features including outrigger monitoring and VarioBase® variable support base which enhances flexibility and increases the cranes' lifting capacity.The LRT 1100-2.1 rough terrain crane has a telescopic boom with Liebherr’s time-tested telematic telescoping system for rough-terrain cranes, on which the various telescoping sections can be extended independently with a single cylinder and then pinned to the telescopic section above. Whereas the LRT 1090-2.1 rough terrain crane offers rope pull technology. This telescoping technology enables the boom to be extended quickly to any length using a two-stage hydraulic cylinder with a rope extension mechanism.Both systems are incredibly simple and easy to use for either power or length."
Liebherr tower cranes expands in Lyon area,News |03/28/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-tower-cranes-expands-in-lyon-area.html?page=6,"To support the continued development of tower crane sales and rental in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, Liebherr has moved its Saint-Priest agency to a larger location within the city.Find out more",News,03/28/2023,"By increasing the outdoor storage area from 6,000 m² to 12,000 m², Liebherr is acquiring infrastructure to store up to 1,300 km of tower masts. A 500 m² building provides crane repair and maintenance. The loading and unloading area can accommodate up to ten trays simultaneously and install the self-erecting cranes on transport axles. A Liebherr 380 EC-B 16 Litronic crane with a 55 m jib and a hook height of 35 m effectively covers the handling area of crane components stored on site. In addition, a modern fleet management helps to ensure that customers receive exactly that crane that fits their needs.. Modern rental fleetAs a manufacturer, Liebherr has always seen rental as a privileged way to make its customers able to experience new products. The rental fleet in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes is very recent since its average age is around four years old. Liebherr offers its customers machines equipped with the latest technology, such as high-tensile fibre rope. Fibre cranes offer many advantages both in terms of improving load capacities and increasing the lifetime of the rope. For example, a 300 EC-B 12 Fibre crane has just joined the rental fleet and a 370 EC-B 12 Fibre crane has been sold for the Lyon-Torino railway job site.. Closer to customers in the areaThe Liebherr agency in Saint-Priest relies on its own regional team as well as on a network of external partners made up of fitters, approved after-sales service partners, breakdown service providers and carriers in order to effectively network the territory. For sale or rental, Liebherr is thus able to offer personalized local service to all of its customers in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes sector. Thus, for its regional customers, Liebherr has been able to supply cranes on major projects such as the Tour To-Lyon, the Chambéry stadium, the Lyon-Turin rail link or even the Montenvers station in Chamonix.. Increasing success for K-type cranesThe Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region is a very dynamic sector for self-erecting cranes. Although the demand for mountain work sites is rather seasonal, it is very strong. Liebherr has equipped itself with Litrax high-speed axles to efficiently manage transport throughout the whole sector. These 80 km/h axles are equipped with directional wheels for exceptional manoeuvrability, pneumatic suspensions which compensate for variations in ground level.The modular design of the Litrax axles makes it possible to transport L1 and K cranes; for which demand, in particular for the 81 K.1 and 125 K models, is increasingly sustained. Indeed, with its 55 m jib, a capacity of 8 tonnes and a hook height of 41.5 m in horizontal jib, the 125 K offers an alternative to tower cranes especially on cramped sites, difficult to access with a limited load requirement; such as renovation or civil engineering sites. The 125 K is the largest self-erecting crane model on the market."

Reflecting this commitment, the company has retained the Gold Medal awarded by EcoVadis, one of the leading providers of sustainability ratings. Find out more",Press releases,03/22/2023,"With a solid Gold rating, Liebherr-MCCtec GmbH has once again demonstrated its commitment to sustainability management. EcoVadis asseses sustainabillty performance in four key areas; the environment, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement. In all areas, the company was able to maintain or improve on the already high level of the previous year. Particularly good results were achieved in the environment category.Progress in the area of the environmentWith the life cycle analyses carried out in accordance with the ISO standard and the calculation of the CO2 footprint according to the “Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard,” environmental impacts are quantified and used as input for the development of sustainable products and services. By developing future drive concepts for maritime cranes and construction machinery, Liebherr-MCCtec GmbH is able to deliver concrete options to it’s customers for reducing their direct and indirect CO2 emissions and thus continue to support them as a solution provider on their way to a net-zero future.. Solution provider for a green futureLiebherr-MCCtec GmbH is taking many measures to reduce the CO2 footprint of its products. A focus on the development of alternative drive concepts and digital solutions for energy-efficient and resource-saving machines along with the increasing use of green electricity at all manufacturing sites, and high product and service quality to extend product service life all help to reduce the carbon footprint.“The Gold Medal award not only underlines the responsibility we take for the environment and society, but also shows our customers, employees and partners that reliability and sustainability are amongst our top priorities,” says Tatjana Grissemann, Corporate Responsibility Manager at Liebherr-MCCtec GmbH.. The right technologies at the right timeResearch and development in the past year focused, among other things, on expanding the electrification of the entire equipment portfolio. The CBG 500 E, a fully electric transshipment crane, was added in 2022. In the near future, alternatives to the proven electrohydraulic drive concept will also be offered for marine and offshore cranes. Last year, Liebherr also launched the new evolutionary stage of the mobile harbor crane, a new unplugged unit which, thanks to its battery-powered travel mode, offers the possibility of operating the LHM with electric power supply 100% emission-free without restricting its unique mobility.In the construction equipment segment, six new unplugged models were launched in 2022: the LRH 100.1 unplugged and LRH 200 unplugged piling rigs, the LB 25 unplugged and LB 30 unplugged drilling rigs, and the LR 1130.1 unplugged and LR 1160.1 unplugged crawler cranes. During operation, the machines can be connected to a conventional power supply or used wirelessly. In total, more than 20 machines of the unplugged series are already in operation worldwide. In addition to the newly developed concepts, however, the existing drive systems are also being permanently refined in terms of performance, efficiency, and cost in order to defend Liebherr’s innovative edge.The ship to shore container cranes and rail mounted gantry cranes have always been powered by electricity and now, our electric rubber tyre gantry cranes are available with a choice of cable reeling drum or busbar power supply. In addition, hybrid RTGs with onboard energy recovery and storage are available. All these electric machines have an active front end to return energy to the grid, and our Liebherr Liduro drive systems are continually developed to ensure maximum energy efficiency of all our cranes.Hydrogenated vegetable oil, also known as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO for short), plays an important role at Liebherr. HVO is an alternative fuel which, in its pure form or as an additive to fossil diesel, can now power a large proportion of Liebherr’s construction machinery, cranes and mining equipment, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90%.. Saving resources through remanufacturingFor the best possible environmental protection, the correct use of resources is of great importance to Liebherr-MCCtec GmbH. Remanufacturing contributes in an important way to the circular economy, acting sustainably in the long term and doing business profitably. In this process, used components such as diesel engines, hydraulic components and transmissions are remanufactured and resold. Compared with recycling, where used goods are converted back into raw material in an energy-intensive process, the focus of the Reman program is not on gaining raw materials but on adding value to the used product. An analysis showed that there is a CO2 savings potential of more than 50% for important diesel engine components such as crankcases and crankshafts. Reman can thus save up to 75% in raw materials and energy.Liebherr-MCCtec GmbH supports sustainability goals of the United NationsAs a signatory to the UN Global Compact, the progress made in the areas of human rights, working conditions, the environment and anti-corruption was published for the first time in a progress report in 2022. With its commitment, Liebherr-MCCtec GmbH is contributing to the realization of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.Liebherr MCCtec GmbH will continue to expand its commitment to sustainability in 2023. Thus, the share of electricity from renewable energies in the company's own value creation is to increase to a total of more than 80 %. In addition, Liebherr-MCCtec GmbH is implementing further measures in the supply chain: On the one hand, signing the Supplier Code of Conduct is a condition for every new supplier approval. On the other hand, all current direct suppliers of Liebherr-MCCtec GmbH will be asked to confirm compliance with our ecological and social requirements in the coming months.Read more about our commitment to the principles of the UN Global Compact in our progress report..

Full Tilt Crane Services is using the LR 1400 SX to lift concrete tilt-up panels, which are being manufactured on site by their parent company Martin Concrete Construction, Inc.Find out more",Press releases,03/21/2023,"“To lift our biggest parts!” That was just one of the reasons why Full Tilt Crane Services added the LR 1400 SX to its fleet. “We bought the machine to meet the needs of our customers: to lift larger and heavier pieces at one time,” explains Managing Director Jason Richardson.Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH developed the LR 1400 SX because of this market requirement, to provide a versatile crawler crane for ever heavier and bigger loads. With the new model, the factory has successfully expanded its portfolio to include loads up to 400 tonnes.The tilt-up panels, which the LR 1400 SX is lifting on the construction site in Atlanta, are produced on-site. No precast elements and no truck deliveries. The largest tilt-up panel has a height of approximately 34 metres. “You’re not going to be able to do that in the precast market.” The tilt-up panels produced by Martin Concrete Concrete on-site have the advantage that it makes them considerably more flexible than precast. This is where the size of the LR 1400 SX plays a significant role. “The sky’s the limit,” jokes Jason Richardson. It will probably be boundless when the construction of the Electric Owl Studios is complete and ready for “Action”.Quick set-up. Safe operation.During the development stage, it was important for Liebherr that set-up and transportation are easy, despite the size of the crawler crane. With the compact transport weight of 46 tonnes, it can be easily moved between the jobsites. “The self-assembly system of the crane is very important to us. We don’t need an assist crane. Right now, we can fully assembly our LR 1400 SX in under 12 hours.” Full Tilt Crane Services frequently moves from jobsite to jobsite, often completing their projects within one to two weeks.The fact that the LR 1400 SX can be moved quickly is a great advantage for the company.Platform and railings remain attached to the uppercarriage during transportation and only need to be folded down. Thanks to the self-assembly system, the boom sections, the carbody counterweight, crawlers and hoist winches can be easily assembled and disassembled without the need for an auxiliary crane. The crane can even hydraulically lift, lower, and secure the 150-tonne rear counterweight without assistance. The rear counterweight itself is modular and can be equipped with 5 or 10-tonne counterweight slabs, depending on requirements.With the assistance systems ground pressure visualization, Gradient Travel Aid or Boom Up-and-Down Assistant, Liebherr has paid special attention to the safety concept of the new weightlifter. In the meantime, Full Tilt Crane Services has ordered a second LR 1400 SX. “Our expectations from the first one met everything we were looking for. It’s a great machine,” enthuses Jason Richardson..

Liebherr’s biggest multipurpose crawler crane: LR 1400 SX,Press releases |03/14/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherrs-biggest-multipurpose-crawler-crane-lr-1400-sx.html?page=8,"It is a big step for Liebherr in Nenzing and a response to the needs of the market. With the new LR 1400 SX, Liebherr-Werk Nenzing Nenzing GmbH extends its range of crawler cranes to include lifting capacities of up to 441 USt (400 t).Find out more",Press releases,03/14/2023,"For Conexpo 2023, the LR 1400 SX is fitted with a 134.5 ft (41 m) main boom and a 144.4 ft (44 m) luffing jib. Gerhard Frainer, Managing Director of Sales at the Austrian site, describes the machine as “a big step for the factory,” and adds, “The wish for a bigger crane came from the market.”With the compact transport weight of 50.7 USt (46 t), the complete crane can be transported easily between jobsites. Platform and railings remain attached to the uppercarriage during transportation and only need to be folded down. Due to the crane’s self-assembly system, the boom sections, carbody counterweight, crawlers and hoist winches can be easily assembled and disassembled without the need for an auxiliary crane. The crane can even hydraulically lift, lower, and secure the 165.3 USt (150 t) rear counterweight without assistance. The rear counterweight itself is modular and can be equipped with 5.5 or 11 USt (5 or 10 t) counterweight slabs, depending on requirements.The flexibility and mobility of the crane can be seen when space is restricted. The four crawler drives make it easier to maneuver the LR 1400 SX on jobsites where space is tight. Thanks to the track width adjustment, access on narrow roads is simplified.Maximum safety through assistance systemsLiebherr paid particular attention to the safety concept while designing the crane. One highlight is the Gradient Travel Aid for the safe negotiation of slopes. The crane’s control system automatically calculates the center of gravity and warns the operator before the crane leaves the safe area. While traveling, the operator constantly receives information about the permissible and actual gradient, and the crane's overall center of gravity. If necessary, the boom angle can be altered so that the machine remains in the safe area.The Ground Pressure Visualization of the LR 1400 SX calculates the current ground pressure of the crane in real time and compares it with the specified safety limits of the relevant position. The ground pressure is displayed in the operator’s cab. This means the operator is permanently aware of whether the machine is situated in, or is approaching, a critical area. The ground pressure of the crane can also be reduced using the ground pressure reduction plates. During lifting work, the operator can lower these plates to significantly increase the crane's ground contact area. The ground pressure under the crane can thus be reduced by more than half. This safety feature is also particularly useful when lifting long booms from the ground.The Boom Up-and-Down Assistant is also part of the safety concept. When erecting or lowering the boom, this assistance system indicates the approach to the tipping border and automatically stops operation before the operator enters an unsafe zone. The operator no longer has to move the winches of the main boom and luffing jib separately. Controlled folding of the luffing jib begins at the press of a button. The speed of the laying down procedure is controlled with a single joystick. The Boom-Up-and-Down Assistant chooses the safest method for laying down the jib.Flexible and safe operationRadio remote control gives the crane operator a high degree of flexibility and additional safety also during operation. The crane can be operated from outside the cab to allow for a better overview of the construction site and avoid blind spots. Depending on the application, a second person is no longer required to assist with hand signals during lifting operations.While developing the LR 1400 SX, special attention was paid to customer needs. The simple switching of the boom is much appreciated. This means that various fixed and luffing jibs from the LR 1300 can also be installed on this crane.As a multipurpose crane, the LR 1400 SX is used in a wide variety of projects. Whether expanding the infrastructure with bridges or tunnels, constructing stadiums or factories with steel or precast concrete elements, working in the energy sector, lifting work on high buildings, or barge applications – anything is possible..

The rotary drive BAT 300 delivers a maximum torque of 221,269 lbf-ft (300 kNm).Highest efficiency and safety through digital assistance systemsLocking the Kelly bar’s telescopic sections is made significantly easier with the aid of the Kelly visualization system in the LRB 23. Thanks to the real-time display of the Kelly bar’s locking recesses on the cab monitor, the operator is constantly informed about the actual distance to the next locking recess. Color indications also inform the operator when the bar can be locked. Furthermore, false positioning of the Kelly bar during the shake-off process is indicated through a warning signal.During continuous flight auger drilling, the concreting process is automated thanks to the drilling assistant. All assistance systems contribute to time savings, higher availability of the machine and a significant increase in safety during operation. The newly designed piling and drilling rig offers precision, high performance and a long service life.LB 30 unpluggedOver many years the drilling rigs LB 25 and LB 30 have proven themselves in the conventional version. The new battery-operated unplugged versions are identical regarding application possibilities, weight or transport; however, they have the additional advantage of zero emission. The drilling rigs can be used for all common applications in the field of deep foundation.Thanks to the optional extension of the drilling axis, the machines can be deployed for drilling diameters of up to 11.2 ft (3.4 m). The optional rear support and the new design of the modular rear counterweight ensure higher stability and longer service life.In addition to the standard design, both machines are available in a Low Head version with a total height of 46.3 ft (14.1 m), or as Ultra Low Head with only 25.5 ft (7.7 m).For battery operation, the charging cable only needs to be unplugged and, for unlimited operation, reconnected to the construction site power supply.

Liebherr’s 125 K: The largest crane in a successful family,Press releases |03/14/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherrs-125-k-the-largest-crane-in-a-successful-family.html?page=8,"With a radius of 180 ft (55 m) and a hook height of up to approx. 217 ft (66 m), the Liebherr 125 K is currently the largest fast-erecting crane on the market. Visitors at Conexpo 2023 in Las Vegas can now see the innovative K series concept for themselves.Find out more",Press releases,03/14/2023,"The 125 K offers an initial hook height of approx. 98 ft (29.5 m) as standard. Five tower sections can be inserted to reach a total hook height of approx. 136 ft (42 m). This allows the crane to handle larger construction projects as well. If the hook height still isn’t sufficient, a 30° luffed jib position enables the crane to reach a hook height of 217 ft (66 m).The crane has a maximum load capacity of 17,630 lbs (8,000 kg) and can lift up to 2,866 lbs (1,300 kg) with the jib head at a radius of 180 ft (55 m). Its exceptional flexibility is also demonstrated by its five radius options, ranging from 115 ft (35 m) to 180 ft (55 m). The fast-erecting crane can be transported to site by trailer or semi-trailer with the appropriate axles. It travels as a complete unit so that it can be erected directly on site. No other tools are needed as assembly is achieved by means of low-maintenance rope kinematics.. Flexible deployment even in tight spacesConstruction site conditions are becoming increasingly tight and therefore require tower cranes to have compact dimensions to match. With its 11 ft (3.2 m) slewing radius, the Liebherr 125 K fast-erecting crane fits into very small spaces, something unique for a crane of this size. Due to its variable slewing radius, which can be extended to 13 ft (4 m), the number of transportable ballasts can be reduced. This in turn reduces costs and allows the crane to be used in basements and similar spaces.In addition to familiar features such as the Micromove fine positioning mode, Load-Plus (short-term load increase of 20 %) and Liebherr's Speed2Lift pure two-line operation, further improvements have also been thought out in detail. This includes new lighting with LED floodlights to ensure even better illumination of job sites.. External cab for optimal viewThe 125 K operates via Liebherr radio remote control. Two displays provide feedback on the current operating data. The remote control enables the crane operator to be close to the action and, at the same time, have everything important in view.The 125 K has the option of being fitted with an external crane operator's cab. The ergonomic cab offers optimal visibility of the loads to be moved, easy entry and exit and plenty of room for every operator. Similar to the crane's unfolding, the assembly of the cab also works without any additional tools. The crane assembles the cab itself by moving it to a defined position on the tower, without any rotation.. Custom paintwork possibleNorth American-based Extreme Construction Inc. is a Liebherr customer who has opted for the 125 K, in this case with an external cab and special paint finish. For its first job, the crane assisted in the construction of an eight-story residential building in the New York metropolitan area. Its multiple tasks included lifting concrete components and placing steel structures.In contrast to other lifting solutions, such as loading or telescopic cranes, there was also no need to plan in extra tracks and positioning sites. Given the limited space on the construction site, this was a decisive argument in favor of the fast-erecting crane. The 125 K also impressed the customers with its reach, usability, Litronic assistance systems and flexibility.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

It consists of the pivot section as well as six telescopic sections and is extended and bolted fully automatically with the Liebherr TELEMATIK high-speed telescopic system.A 35 ft (10.8 m) single folding jib or a 35 – 62 ft (10.8 –19 m) double folding jib is available for the LRT 1130-2.1. It is mounted at angles of 0°, 20° or 40°, or can be hydraulically tilted from 0° to 40°. With an additional 23 ft (7 m) lattice section as a telescopic extension, this new crane reaches hook heights of up to 279 ft (85 m). The folding jib is carried on the right-hand side of the boom. At the same time, a 9 ft 6 in (2.9 m) assembly jib can be attached to the left-hand side of the boom. A side-folding rooster sheave, which can be operated in 2-line mode, rounds off the boom options.Economical transportLiebherr has designed the dimensions of the new LRT 1130-2.1 so that it can be transported economically on low-loaders worldwide. Its width is 11 ft 2 in (3.4 m), its height 12 ft 7 in (3.85 m) and its chassis length is 30 ft 8 in (9.4 m). The transport weight is 106,000 lb (48 t) without ballast, but with the folding jib and hook block. This can be reduced to 98,750 lb (44.8 t). These values are unique in the class of powerful 2-axle all-terrain cranes. A permit-free standard transport vehicle is sufficient for the 44,100 lb (20 t) ballast and additional equipment. The counterweight consists of three ballast slabs and is attached to the slewing platform via self-assembly with ballasting rams.""Safety first"" – safety equipment and assistance systems set new standardsHigh safety levels in every respect were the main priority for the design of the new LRT 1130-2.1, which features an outrigger monitoring system as standard. The outrigger status, on tires or supports, is detected automatically and saved to the crane controller. The attachment of the ballast to the slewing platform and the installation of the optional double folding jib, including its angle adjustment system, are also recorded and monitored.The VarioBase® variable support base, which was developed by Liebherr and is standard equipment on all Liebherr LRT cranes, makes an important contribution to increasing safety. VarioBase® allows each individual crane outrigger to be extended to any length. The crane work is controlled by the load moment limiter within the LICCON controller, which calculates the maximum load capacities precisely for the current situation. This prevents accidents caused by human error during the assembly process and when hoisting loads. VarioBase® also offers greater flexibility on the construction site, higher lifting capacities and a larger working range. The greatest advantages are achieved in the areas directly above the outriggers.Safety is also enhanced by providing greater comfort for the operating personnel. The new 140 USt (130 t) crane also features the wide crane cab that has already proven its worth on the other Liebherr LRT models. It can be tilted backwards to provide greater comfort when hoisting loads to great heights. Clear, self-explanatory controls make the crane easy to handle. They allow crane drivers to concentrate on the main focus of their job, working with the crane and the load. Liebherr calls this concept KISS: ""keep it simple and safe"".There are ladders, a large number of handles and an electronically extending platform on the cab to ensure safe access to the crane. The new LRT crane features a wide range of storage boxes for extensive accessories, lifting tackle and support timbers as standard. There is also storage for the load hook.Like the LRT 1090-2.1 and LRT 1100-2.1 cranes, the LRT 1130-2.1 also complies with a global, uniform safety standard and with globally valid regulations such as the US ASME B30.5 standard, the European EN 13000 standard and the Australian Standards (AS). The machines also include systems to prevent safety equipment being bypassed. Liebherr is a pioneer in the industry in this respect.High off-road capability The new LRT 1130-2.1 is designed for durability, off-road mobility and maneuverability. It is powered by a 6-cylinder CUMMINS combustion engine that complies with all applicable exhaust emission regulations. It can be operated without restrictions with hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO). The engine develops 252 bhp (188 kW) and supplies a maximum torque of 875 lb-ft (1,186 Nm). A 6-speed powershift transmission from DANA and large 29.5 R 25 tires guarantee the required off-road capability. All-wheel and crab steering ensure easy handling and high maneuverability in constricted conditions.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The master of all roads: New Liebherr LTM 1100-5.3 mobile crane ,Press releases |03/14/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-master-of-all-roads-new-liebherr-ltm-1100-5-3-mobile-crane-conexpo.html?page=8,"At Conexpo 2023, Liebherr presents a mobile crane that takes the combination of mobility, economy and performance to a new level. The LTM 1100-5.3 offers a powerful 203 ft (62 m) telescopic boom and carries up to 37,250 lb (16.9 t) of ballast with a 26,450 lb (12 t) axle load on public roads. The new crane also offers economical mobility worldwide, as it can travel with an axle load of only 19,840 lb (9 t). For this reason, Liebherr is presenting the new LTM 1100-5.3 under the slogan ""The master of all roads"". It is the second crane in the Liebherr range to feature the new LICCON3 control system.Find out more",Press releases,03/14/2023,"When designing the LTM 1100-5.3, Liebherr focused above all on lightweight construction to allow as much ballast as possible to be carried with a 26,450 lb (12 t) axle load; and to achieve the lowest possible axle loads by reducing ballast. In addition, the new crane was designed with a long, strong telescopic boom in mind.High mobility, worldwideEven in countries where mobile cranes with a 26,450 lb (12 t) axle load are permitted on the roads, operators have been requesting cranes that can be driven with low axle loads and total weights by simply removing the ballast. These models deliver major benefits when it comes to obtaining licenses and route permits. Day-to-day circumstances often require reduced weights, such as when driving over bridges and in inner cities.When it comes to flexible axle loads, the new LTM 1100-5.3 sets unprecedented standards. With 1,760 lb (0.8 t) of ballast, it reaches a total weight of 94,800 lb (44 t) with axle loads of 19,840 lb (9 t). With 9,700 lb (4.4 t) of ballast, it can travel with 22,050 lb (10 t) of axle load and a total weight of 105,800 lb (48 t). With an axle load of 26,450 lb (12 t), the new 110 USt (100 t) crane can carry up to 37,250 lb (16.9 t) of counterweights. At 75 percent of the maximum ballast of 49,600 lb (22.5 t), this is a new record for mobile cranes worldwide. This allows the new LTM 1100-5.3 to perform most of its jobs as a taxi crane without additional ballast transport. Even with maximum ballast, the axle loads of 29,760 lb (13.5 t) are low and evenly distributed across all axles. The new LTM 1100-5.3 has a narrow width of 8 ft 4 in (2.55 m) – an additional advantage when driving on roads and construction sites. It is the first 5-axle mobile crane worldwide based on this narrow design.The new LTM 1100-5.3 offers operators in California a particularly big advantage: it is the first and so far the only 5-axle all-terrain crane to receive Cal-trans approval. This means that it is road-legal in the normal driving condition, with the telescopic boom over the front. Operation with a dolly is not necessary. This means that the new Liebherr LTM 1100-5.3 is ideal to enter the “truck crane” market, which is particularly popular in the USA.Large working range with the 203 ft (62 m) telescopic boomAt 203 ft (62 m), the telescopic boom is 6 ft 7 in (2 m) longer than the next most powerful Liebherr 5-axle machine, the LTM 1110-5.2. In addition, a 31 to 53 ft (9.5 to 16 m) folding jib is available which, as an option, can also be adjusted hydraulically between 0° and 40°. This enables the LTM 1100-5.3 to achieve hoisting heights of up to 249 ft (76 m) and radii of up to 210 ft (64 m). Other options include a 6 ft 7 in (2 m) assembly jib and a side-folding rooster sheave, which offer additional flexibility in use.The new 110 USt (100 t) crane offers extra safety, flexibility and lifting capacity thanks to the VarioBase® variable outrigger. Greater flexibility on the construction site is also provided by the standard VarioBallast®, which allows the ballast radius to be adjusted between 13 ft 1 in and 16 ft 8 in (4.0 and 5.1 m).LICCON3 crane control systemThe third generation of the LICCON (Liebherr Computed Control) system relies on proven control features, but also includes a completely new software package and programming language as well as a faster databus, significantly more storage space and more computing power. Crane operators who are familiar with the previous control system will quickly and easily get to grips with the new version, as the recognition value is very high. Proven hardware components, such as the mobile operating and display unit BTT, have been adopted. The touchscreen function on the large new display in the superstructure cab means that it is now even easier and more comfortable to control. The way in which the information is shown has also been revised and simplified. In addition, LICCON3 cranes are prepared for telemetry and fleet management as standard. In the future, crane contractors will be able to view and evaluate all the relevant data using the MyLiebherr customer portal.New driver’s cab and crane cabAs a result of the high synergy effects involved, Liebherr is launching the new operator’s cab at the same time as the LICCON3 control system. The modern design features premium materials and timeless lines as well as delivering a whole host of improvements for the crane operator. These include the new multifunction steering wheel, side roller blind on the operator’s door, improved instruments and modules as well as new displays. Options such as a central locking system with remote key and the ""Coming and Leaving Home"" function also offer additional convenience.A new automatic heating and air-conditioning system in the operator’s cab and in the crane cab features an adapted design and ensures a high level of comfort. A sun sensor detects strong sunshine and automatically adjusts the heating settings.The lighting packages for the crane cab, superstructure, rear of the vehicle, front headlights, lattice fly jib and telescopic boom have been optimized and can be operated with LEDs. The benefits of LED technology include a longer service life and superior lighting performance.ZF TraXon DynamicPerform gear unitThe new LTM 1100-5.3 features the innovative DynamicPerform coupling module which ensures virtually wear-free starting and maneuvering without overheating for the modular ZF TraXon gear unit, as it transmits the engine output via an oil-cooled clutch plate pack. The friction heat generated when starting is dissipated in the clutch oil and supplied to the vehicle’s cooling system via an oil/water heat exchanger. Operators benefit from greater efficiency and lower maintenance costs.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Powerful performance and impressive reach: the 470 EC-B flat-top crane from Liebherr,Press releases |03/14/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/powerful-performance-and-impressive-reach-the-470-ec-b-flat-top-crane-from-liebherr.html?page=8,"Liebherr presents the 470 EC-B, its largest flat-top crane in steel rope design, at Conexpo in Las Vegas. The top-slewing crane excels with a maximum lifting capacity of 35,270 lbs (16 t) or 44,090 lbs (20 t).Find out more",Press releases,03/14/2023,"The EC-B series flagship crane offers a jib length of 262 ft (80 m). With an optional jib extension, this reach can be increased to 272 ft (83 m), setting new standards on the market. With a jib length of 262 ft (80 m), the 35,270 lbs (16-tonne) version of the 470 EC-B achieves a lifting capacity of up to 7,050 lbs (3,200 kg) at its head; the 44,090 lbs (20-tonne) version features a top lifting capacity of up to 6,610 lbs (3,000 kg). The jib can be sectioned for precise site planning.. Optimized for transport and assemblyDuring development, the focus was as much on assembly and transport as it was on performance. All cranes in the EC-B series allow the jib and counter-jib to be attached to the slewing platform easily, conveniently and safely. This is made possible by Liebherr’s proven quick assembly connections. Only five truck loads are needed to transport the 470 EC-B’s slewing section and jib, including counter-ballast. Advantages are: Reducing time, costs and emissions. This allows Liebherr to offer customers a high-quality crane that operates safely, efficiently and in an environmentally responsible way.The climbable crane features a connection for both 24 HC 420 and 24 HC 630 tower systems. The 24 HC tower system is ideal for large cranes with high lifting capacities. Compact dimensions allow the cost-efficient transport of its tower sections from A to B. The 470 EC-B has been optimized for the 24 HC 420 tower system to offer an economical solution for a freestanding hook height of up to approx. 223 ft (68 m). A maximum freestanding hook height of approx. 325 ft (99 m) is achieved with the 24 HC 630.. Ergonomic cab and intuitive operationThe top slewing crane is available with the well-designed LiCAB crane operator's cab that comes in three versions: LiCAB Basic, LiCAB Air and LiCAB AirPlus. All three offer a floor space of more than 22 sq ft (2 m²), an unrestricted view for precision lifting and an ergonomic control stand. These and other comfort features enable the crane operator to work with full focus. The cab’s extensive field of vision provides the crane operator with a clear view of the construction site and the loads to be lifted, ensuring maximum safety.Also included is a twelve-inch display screen with intuitive interface. The Tower Crane Operating System (Tower Crane OS) offers tailored menus, a wide choice of languages and relevant units of measurement to crane operators and assembly engineers to easily find the parameters most relevant to their work. Users navigate their way through the streamlined menu structure via touchscreen. Display masks can be combined in different ways to maintain an overview during crane operation and scaling. The exceptional usability of the Tower Crane OS means that training and familiarization times are reduced.. LED advertising space lighting for a powerful promotional impactLED advertising panel lighting can be configured to ensure a substantial long-distance effect and visibility, particularly at the onset of twilight and at night. With a total area of just under 97 sq ft (9 m²), the robust lighting delivers a powerful and effective promotional impact. The panels don’t have to be mounted separately during assembly and can remain in place on the counter-jib end section during transport. Signage is also easily applied.. A series of outstanding cranesAs they don’t have a tower head structure, several EC-B series flat-top cranes are able to work together safely on the same site, even in tight conditions. EC-B cranes are specifically designed to meet the requirements of modern construction sites including transport, assembly, capacity, and safety. They cover a wide performance spectrum, ranging from small city to large trans-shipment cranes. The 470 EC-B completes the top end of Liebherr's successful series, with the crane reflecting the construction industry’s trend towards heavier components.A construction project in Copenhagen (Denmark), where a 470 EC-B is in use, is a good example. A residential and office building with a 328 ft (100 m) high tower is being built in the Carlsberg Byen district. Liebherr dealer, Normas, has opted for a 470 EC-B with a hook height of 115 ft (35 m) and a 148 ft (45 m) jib for this job. The site requires a lot of heavy precast concrete parts to be moved.When it came to building new apartments in Nuremberg (Germany), the project team, consisting of the Liebherr Tower Crane Center, Liebherr dealer Beutlhauser and Mauss Bau, found the right solution in a 470 EC-B. With a radius of 197 ft (60 m), the crane can transport heavy loads over longer distances and places all required parts at whatever location is specified. The 470 EC-B also carried out a task that was a little out of the ordinary. Due to an underground railway line running under the site, the use of a mobile crane to support a second crane, a 172 EC-B, proved impossible. So, the smaller flat-top crane was assembled with the help of the 470 EC-B alone.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr further expands its axial piston portfolio,Press releases |03/14/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-further-expands-its-axial-piston-portfolio.html?page=8,"At this year's Conexpo, Liebherr presents its expanded axial piston pump portfolio along with the successful high-speed DMVA double motor.Find out more",Press releases,03/14/2023,"Liebherr expands the existing product portfolio of open circuit pumps by the nominal size of 550 and as a double pump by the nominal size of 1,100 cc (1,100 cm3). Moreover, the new nominal size of 100 adds to the LH30VO family.DPVO 550i – on the pulse of current affairs with new nominal sizes of open circuit pumpsThe mining and industrial sectors, as well as maritime applications place increasing demands on the availability and longevity of machines and technology. In order to keep up, the components product segment at the site in Bulle (Switzerland) is enlarging its product portfolio of open circuit pumps by the nominal size of 550, which can also be used as a double pump of 1,100 cc (1,100 cm3).""Like all pumps in this product family, the DPVO 550i is characterized by a particular robustness. In the view of digitalization, this product is ready to incorporate various sensor technologies"", explains Guillaume Bonnetot, General Manager Systems at Liebherr-Mining Equipment Colmar SAS. ""We look forward to seeing Liebherr’s components in use in our own machines"".LH30VO100 – the newest member of the pump familyModularity is the signature trait of the LH30VO family with nominal sizes of 28, 45 and 85. Liebherr is further pursuing this approach with the inclusion of the nominal size of 100 cc (100 cm3). Among other things, the LH30VO100 consists of a modular system of eight controllers with a variety of combination options. The variable drive-through concept allows the selection and addition of further pumps, when installing them on the machine. In doing so, Liebherr-Components fulfills the growing demand for products with a high degree of flexibility. With all its nominal sizes, the entire LH30VO pump family offers a wide range of applications from mobile machinery and stationary hydraulics, for primary work functions to secondary applications, such as in fans, auxiliary drives or steering systems.DMVA 165-165 – high power density and flexibility in controlThe Liebherr axial piston double motor DMVA product family features a swash plate design for the use in open and closed circuit. It is especially popular for use in winch and drilling drives. Thanks to its back-to-back design, the two smaller rotary groups allow for significantly higher speeds as compared to a larger rotary group. Both swashplates can be swiveled independently or parallel to each other. The common connecting plate, in turn, makes the piping installation much easier. George and Peter Allpass of Alpine Logging based in South Africa, the manufacturer of cable logging winch systems for the timber industry worldwide, explain: “One of the advantages of the DMVA double motor is its impressive maximum speed.

Digital clearance monitoring for slewing bearings,Press releases |03/14/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/digital-clearance-monitoring-for-slewing-bearings-conexpo.html?page=8,"With the condition monitoring system for slewing bearings, Liebherr created a digital monitoring system. The integrated wear measurement system, bearing clearance monitoring (BCM), ensures optimum monitoring of the slewing bearings in various applications, such as mining and material handling equipment or maritime applications.Find out more",Press releases,03/14/2023,"The focus of digital clearance maintenance lies on personnel safety. ""A distinct disadvantage of all common wear measurement methods is the necessity for service technicians to mount dial gauges or other measuring devices directly on the slewing bearing in the danger zone under the excavator or other machines,"" explains Wolfram Halder, Product Manager of the slewing bearings business unit. ""The Liebherr BCM system makes this unnecessary, as the measuring devices are already permanently installed on the bearing."" Another advantage is flexibility in terms of time. Currently, machine operators commission external service providers to measure the bearing clearance. This makes them dependent on the experience and schedule of third-party companies. ""With digital maintenance for slewing bearings from Liebherr, measurements can be carried out at any time outside the danger zone, independently of external service providers,"" explains Halder.Measurement within minutes: How the BCM from Liebherr worksThe right technology and the right connection make it happen. The sensor connection box receives the data from the sensors attached to the slewing bearing and supplies the entire BCM system with power. The gateway stores the sensor data and updates for the BCM. This allows operators to use the system autonomously in regions without a data connection. This is the case in mines, for example, as these often do not have the necessary mobile reception. A direct connection via Bluetooth makes the measurement process possible from a safe distance and without a network connection.

Liebherr introduces H2 direct injection for heavy-duty combustion engines,Press releases |03/14/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-introduces-h2-direct-injection-for-heavy-duty-combustion-engines-conexpo.html?page=9,"Liebherr develops injection systems for hydrogen combustion engines used in on- and off-highway applications. Robustness against dust, dirt and vibrations, as well as other harsh environmental conditions are a few of the key requirements. Peak power and dynamic load changes are among other challenges for H2 combustion engines.Find out more",Press releases,03/14/2023,"At Conexpo 2023, Liebherr presents a hydrogen direct injection solution for heavy-duty combustion engines. With this technology, the Group aims to achieve maximum power density equal to the one of a conventional combustion engine. Hydrogen-based powertrains are an important part of Liebherr's technology-open approach to alternative powertrain concepts.Hydrogen direct injection: What's behind it?The aim of matching the performance of an H2-DI engine to that of a diesel engine requires the system to be capable of ensuring high flow rates. Due to the low density of hydrogen gas, the injector needs to be a high flow design. To enable precise control of even the smallest quantities, the system pressure must be regulated with pinpoint accuracy. In Liebherr's H2 injection system, this is achieved by means of a gas volume control valve. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the injector has zero leakage and is gas-tight.""To achieve the same drivability with an H2 system as with a diesel, the hydrogen injection system must be optimally aligned with the engine's torque and power,"" explains Richard Pirkl, Managing Director of Technology and Development at Liebherr-Components Deggendorf GmbH. ""This means that during the transition from idle to full load, the necessary amount of fuel and the corresponding system pressure must be made available as quickly as possible.""System design low pressure direct injection (LPDI)Liebherr's H2 injection system is designed to provide extremely fast and accurate pressure control, regardless of fuel tank position, machine size, layout or engine installation. This design provides a two-stage pressure control. While the first stage initially stabilizes the variable pressure from the fuel tank, the second stage fine-tunes said pressure. The injection pressure is controlled by activating the gas-metering valve via the electronic control unit (ECU). The ECU controls the gas-metering valve by a closed-loop feed-forward controller. Custom-developed hydrogen-specific software modules can be integrated into third-party application software and/ or control units.""The H2-DI system is designed to operate without an electronic pressure release valve. The idea behind it is to keep the system as simple as possible, whilst avoiding the release of any hydrogen gas into the atmosphere during operation"", Pirkl summarizes.The injector: a key component""The injector is the most sophisticated and, at the same time, performance-determining component of the hydrogen fuel system"", explains Pirkl. The overall dimensions of Liebherr's H2 LPDI injector are similar to those of diesel injectors for heavy-duty commercial vehicle engines. In particular, the critical maximum outer diameter is within the same range as for diesel injectors.In the current sample stage, the injector can be equipped with various hydrogen connections by means of a screw-in insert. Two basic variants of the injector head (radial and axial H2 inlet) allow for different installation situations. To ensure the correct spray pattern and jet direction, the injector nozzle is equipped with a diffuser cap. ""It is interchangeable in the sample stage and allows cost-effective testing of different variations to define the best configuration. Using a screw-on solution, the diffuser cap can be easily replaced"", says Pirkl.The injector is opened and closed via a needle that is directly activated by an energized coil. To meet the target housing dimensions, the coil has been enlarged. The challenges thereby were to achieve sufficient electro-magnetic force for direct activation, while matching the critical external dimensions in the coil area to the engine manufacturer's requirements. Multiple simulations of different coil concepts, materials and installation situations were tested throughout the process. The electromagnetic force was tuned to ensure that the proper opening of the injector is possible, while minimizing the closing delay.""An additional key development goal was to control the hydrogen injector with the existing engine control units, as well as the current standard profiles already known from these applications"", Pirkl summarizes.Test results at a glanceAs previously mentioned, the tightness of the hydrogen injector against hydrogen is one of the biggest challenges in the development of H2 components. Tests on a vacuum leakage test rig show very good results for Liebherr's current injector design.""Measured injection rates of the current sample already show extremely stable progressions. Overall, the injector displays a good opening and closing behavior"", explains Pirkl. ""On the functional test bench, we have been able to show good control of the injection rate at different pressure levels. The required minimum injection rates of ~ 0.0005 oz. (2.5 mg) per stroke are achieved at 145 psi (10 bar) rail pressure"".Liebherr has carried out all the tests with a completely dry-running injector without any additional lubricating oil. Since the injector was developed exclusively for hydrogen and, thus, no concepts and parts of a natural gas or gasoline injector platform were used, the focus was on the dry-running capability of the moving components. The Liebherr team in Deggendorf is currently performing endurance testing.Hydrogen direct injection: current development and outlookHydrogen direct injection is particularly well suited for applications with high demands on dynamics and power density within a limited installation space and is a feasible concept, which Liebherr in Deggendorf is further developing. ""Product validation will be one of the most important tasks in the development of hydrogen fuel systems in the future"", says Pirkl. ""The next steps are to optimize the low-pressure DI system in terms of injection stability and dynamic performance. Based on the low-pressure DI system for heavy-duty engines, we are also developing and testing a system with higher flow rates for larger engines"", concludes Pirkl.In parallel, Liebherr is working on H2 PFI injectors. The system approaches for port fuel injection and direct injection use a common, scalable injector platform as the basis. With this extensive product portfolio, Liebherr meets a wide range of engine requirements and enables a broad spectrum of applications for medium and heavy-duty engines, as well as large engines..

It employs a direct hydrogen injection technology to power the engine.Find out more",Press releases,03/14/2023,"In the future, combustion engines will no longer be powered solely by fossil diesel. In order to achieve goals in line with the collective commitment from different countries to take global climate action under the Paris Agreement, fuels from sustainable energy sources must be used. Hydrogen is one of them, since it is a promising carbon-free fuel that does not cause any CO2 emissions when burning inside the internal combustion engine (ICE). Liebherr’s expertise in the development of ICEs will further facilitate a quick introduction of hydrogen technologies to the market – even for heavy-duty applications.Hydrogen engines: a promising futureThe Liebherr components product segment has recently made a significant investment into the development of its hydrogen engine and test facilities. Prototype engines have been tested since 2020. Meanwhile, the prototypes have shown encouraging results in terms of performance and emissions, both on test benches and in the field. Different injection and combustion technologies, such as port fuel injection (PFI) and direct injection (DI), have also been assessed in the process. The first prototype construction machines equipped with these engines have been running since 2021.PFI technology: a starting point in the developmentInitial efforts in the development of a hydrogen engine have considered PFI as the first suitable technology. The first machine running with a 100% hydrogen-fueled Liebherr ICE is the Liebherr R 9XX H2 crawler excavator, which won a Bauma Innovation Prize in October of 2022.DI: a step towards efficient hydrogen enginesEncouraged by the results achieved with the PFI technology, Liebherr further pursues its research and development activities in the field of DI. The 4-cylinder engine prototype H964, exhibited in South Hall at the components’ booth S80821, is equipped with said technology. In this case, hydrogen is injected directly into the combustion chamber, whereas with the PFI solution it is blown into the air intake port. The DI offers increased potential in terms of combustion efficiency and power density, making hydrogen engines an attractive alternative to diesel engines when it comes to more demanding applications.What is next?The components segment expects to kick off series production of hydrogen engines by 2025. In the meantime, the company continues its research activities in fuel injection to further optimize combustion and to ensure maximum power density.In addition to 100% hydrogen-fueled engines, several research endeavors in the area of alternative fuels are currently in progress. One example is a dual fuel engine that can run on hydrogen ignited by HVO injection or fully on HVO. This technology will allow for more flexibility in vehicle operation with different configurations.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

US premiere of the Liebherr PR 766 G8 at Conexpo 2023,Press releases |03/14/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/us-premiere-of-the-liebherr-pr-766-g8-at-conexpo-2023.html?page=9,"The PR 766 G8 further expands the Liebherr fleet of Generation 8 dozers, with an operating weight of up to 119,784 lbs (54,333 kg).Find out more",Press releases,03/14/2023,"A multifunctional dozer for material handling and mining operation, the Liebherr PR 766 G8 is the latest generation specifically developed to let customers take full advantage of its enormous potential in key applications. The newly designed running gear works in combination with all the advantages of the cab and operating comfort, maximizing the operator’s and the machine’s performance and productivity – even on rough terrain over long operating periods. The diesel-hydraulic drive design sets the Liebherr dozer ahead of the competition with conventional torque converters. Particularly in diesel consumption, this provides advantages in efficiency shown by previous generations as well as larger and smaller sister machines.. Performance and economy: advanced, infinitely variable drive designThe new PR 766 G8 is powered by a Liebherr 8-cylinder diesel engine with a maximum output of 490 HP (360 kW) and meets Tier 4f emission standards. The operating weight of the hydrostatic dozer is up to 119,784 lbs, with available blade capacities of 17.8 yd³ (13.6 m³) (Semi-U blade) or 22.2 yd³ (17 m³) (U-blade).The variable hydrostatic Liebherr drive design allows customers to operate the PR 766 G8 to maximize utilization and save time and resources. The drive components and the intelligent Liebherr engine management system are perfectly synchronized, so that the diesel engine is kept at constant speed, within the optimum fuel-efficiency range (~ 1,600 rpm), by the hydrostatic drive. This really sets the Liebherr propulsion drive apart from similar D9 class drive designs available on the market, where the engine speed fluctuates significantly during use.All Generation 8 Liebherr dozers have the ECO function fitted as standard. The operator can select between high performance (including automatic Power Boost) and maximum economy, to ensure further fuel savings in light to medium-duty applications.The complete Liebherr drive train, therefore, contributes to high efficiency and significantly lower fuel consumption compared to the industry standard for the same pushing performance.. In-house manufactured components ensure reliabilityFor decades, Liebherr engines have been proving themselves in the construction industry all over the world. Developed for the harshest operating conditions, the advanced technology of these engines ensures optimum operational safety and length of service life. The proven and tested hydrostatic Liebherr drive also operates with high-quality hydraulic pumps and motors that are virtually wear-free and highly reliable in service.For highly demanding special applications such as in the desert, at low temperatures or in special industry operation (mining, wood, paper, etc.), Liebherr offers a wide range of tried and tested modifications.. High Drive for heavy mining operationsTo match the heavy operating demands of rocky terrain more closely, the drive design of the larger dozer (PR 776) has been specifically adapted for the PR 766 G8.Swivel bearing guide wheels and track rollers absorb shocks and maintain very good track chain traction. This allows the running gear to adapt more closely to the ground surface when driving over rocky terrain, but a more critical factor is the raised position of the final drive. High Drive reduces wear on sprockets and bearing bushes, protects the final drive and seals it from damage and dirt.. Operator comfort: advanced cab design with intuitive controlsThe operator’s cab has been specifically developed for this class of equipment so that the operator can readily find his way around. Using the Liebherr proven joystick function, the operator is able to control all driving and steering movements with just one electronic input device.The cab is packed with special features including the centralized controls, a 9'' touch display, generous storage space and a ventilated storage compartment. The driver can use the display to access all the key machine parameters and simply set operating modes such as the ECO function, automatic engine speed reduction or the drive and the steering response, as well as operate the convenience and safety functions such as the standard reversing camera.The PR 766 G8 has a spacious cab and ergonomic joystick offering the best conditions for fatigue free operation. All the controls for traction drive, blade and ripper can be set by the operator from the most ergonomic position. The seat has an integrated contact switch to automatically detect the operator’s presence, without having to operate a safety lever..

Structural reinforcements on the new lift arms, for example, on the cross tube, increase robustness. The z-bar kinematics with electro-hydraulic pilot controls has larger hydraulic cylinders and more powerful working pumps. The combination of these innovations enables faster cycle times and dynamic and powerful work movements – even with heavy attachments such as high dump buckets in the recycling industry or log grapples in the timber industry.With the increased performance providing a strong basis, Liebherr offers numerous equipment options for industry-specific challenges: High-lift arms, for example, are an extended variant of the regular lift arm, and ensure greater range and efficient loading processes at different heights. For wheel loader applications that regularly require different attachments, there is a view-optimized quick coupler available as well as “Solidlink”, a fully automatic quick-coupler system. This allows machine operators to change between mechanical and hydraulic attachments from the cab quickly and safely at the touch of a button. This saves time and reduces the risk of accidents.XPower® large wheel loaders: With power-split travel drive at the forefront of fuel efficiencyBeing ready for the challenges of different industries also applies to Liebherr’s XPower® large wheel loaders. In the years since their debut, they have established themselves at the forefront of fuel efficiency and robustness. One main reason for that is their power-split travel drive, installed as standard in all Liebherr XPower® wheel loaders. It combines hydrostatic drive, which is ideal for material uptake and travelling over short distances, with mechanical drive, the advantages of which are seen over long distances and when driving on gradients. The combination of these two drive types ensures maximum efficiency and outstanding fuel savings in every application.However, XPower® includes more than its unique power-split driveline: It is an integrated, innovative machine concept that sets benchmarks in terms of fuel efficiency, performance, robustness and comfort. For example, the spacious cab is adapted to the day-to-day needs of the operators. Thanks to the ergonomically interior design, intuitive control elements, practical storage compartments and individual adjustment options such as a height-adjustable display, it offers a comfortable work atmosphere. The extensive use of glass on the cab and the sophisticated design of the engine hood results in optimized visibility in all directions and increased safety.Assistance systems for wheel loaders: Increasing safety and comfort in the daily workLiebherr offers a comprehensive range of intelligent assistance systems for its mid-size and XPower® large wheel loaders, for example, the active personnel detection with brake assistant. This optional assistance system warns the machine operator of hazards in the rear area of the wheel loader. To reduce the number of unnecessary warning signals, the system uses sensors and artificial intelligence to distinguish between people and objects. As soon as the sensors detect a source of danger, the brake assistant automatically decelerates the wheel loader‘s speed. This shortens the stopping distance by multiple feet, reducing the frequency and intensity of potential accidents.For applications that require numerous steering maneuvers, Liebherr offers a comfortable joystick steering system as alternative to the steering wheel. It allows the machine operator to comfortably steer using short movements of the ergonomic joystick. The position of the joystick always corresponds to the respective articulation angle of the wheel loader. Further solutions, such as the Skyview 360° camera system, the Liebherr weighing system or several systems that facilitate the use of the lift arm and the attachment, increase comfort and safety in the daily work with wheel loader..

With its proposal ""The Construction Site of Today"", Liebherr-Werk Telfs GmbH was able to convince the jury with regard to applicability, novelty and degree of maturity, improvement of the environmental balance and cost indication. Wiener Linien, Vienna’s public transport operator, would like to operate its construction sites in a CO2-optimized or CO2-neutral way in the future, contributing to Austria's goal of being climate-neutral by 2040.Commitment pays off: By taking part in the challenge ""CO2 optimized construction site for Wiener Linien"", Liebherr has shown that the Group is innovative and environmentally aware. In mid-December last year, Liebherr-Werk Telfs GmbH, together with Liebherr-EMtec GmbH, presented their idea ""The Construction Site of Today"". Their proposal convinced the jury including Wiener Linien and Public Procurement Promoting Innovation (IÖB). David Lindenthaler, development engineer for technology and pre-development at Liebherr, worked out a concept together with colleagues from various product segments on how CO2 can be reduced at Wiener Linien construction sites. The construction sites are building and civil engineering projects, such as tram stops or tunnel construction for subways. Construction site processes and procedures, construction site equipment and machinery, as well as materials and resources had to be taken into account.. Research on site at the U2/U5 linesFor the creation of the concept, Josef Ratzinger, development engineer at Liebherr-Werk Telfs GmbH, visited the current construction site at the major traffic junction of the U2/U5 lines in Vienna. ""This is a partially open construction site with different levels. We then selected machines from our product portfolio to design tangible solutions,"" explains Ratzinger. The decision was made in favor of, among others, the R 9XX H2 crawler excavator with hydrogen drive, which is characterized by a particularly high degree of innovation; and the LR 1130.1 unplugged crawler crane, which is ready for series production. In addition, Liebherr presented prototypes such as the T33-10e battery-electric telescopic handler.""As one of five winners, we presented our solutions during the innovation dialog with Wiener Linien and IÖB,"" reports Lindenthaler, ""Should a joint evaluation of our prototypes subsequently take place with Wiener Linien, cooperation in terms of product development would be conceivable."" So, it remains exciting, how the Wiener Linien will proceed in the future and whether the competition will be followed by an order."
Denmark's leading recycling company relies on XPower® wheel loader from Liebherr,Press releases |03/10/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/denmarks-leading-recycling-company-relies-on-xpower-wheel-loader-from-liebherr.html?page=10,"RGS Nordic specialises in recycling construction and demolition waste materials and is the market leader in Denmark. It operates a fleet of around 130 construction machines, about two-thirds of which have been supplied by the Liebherr Group.Find out more",Press releases,03/10/2023,"Every day, more than 1,000 truckloads of construction waste and other material arrive at RGS Nordic's facilities to be converted into reusable and circular products and reintegrated into the product cycle. The 40 Liebherr XPower® wheel loaders are used for material handling as part of the process.Michael Jørgensen, strategic purchasing manager, commented: ""The Liebherr wheel loaders need less fuel, are powerful and have hardly any downtime. We are particularly impressed that we achieve 30% more productivity with the same fuel consumption than with comparable wheel loaders in this size class."" Those enormous advantages in fuel consumption also ensure lower CO2 emissions, meaning the machines align perfectly with RGS Nordic's core values.Clear statement: Recycling is the futureAt Denmark's largest waste management site, recycling the delivered material is top priority. ""We aim to make circular economy a sustainable business"", added Jørgensen. The Liebherr wheel loaders play a key role in helping the company achieve that aim. On one hand, they transport the bulky waste pre-sorted by Liebherr excavators to the sorting plants, and on the other, feed the numerous crushing and screening plants with various construction wastes. At the end of the treatment process, the recycled material is reused on construction sites around Copenhagen.RGS Nordic also returns the supplied, partly contaminated material to the product cycle through specialised processing operations, for example by adding substances such as calcium and by constantly shifting the piles of earth using the Liebherr wheel loaders. That function is important to ensure a reliable oxygen supply during composting. Once that operation is complete, the XPower® machines load the recycled material on to trucks for RGS Nordic's customers to use as a natural raw material on a wide variety of construction sites rather than rely on new products.RGS Nordic at a glanceRGS Nordic employs over 200 people and operates 22 reception and treatment facilities in Denmark, including the country's largest waste treatment site and the Nordic region's biggest commercial biological site for treating industrial wastewater. The recycling specialist has set itself a goal of converting even more waste into quality building materials and implementing sustainable processes in the circular economy.

Hybrid RTG retrofit for Baltic Hub,Press releases |03/10/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/hybrid-rtg-retrofit-for-baltic-hub.html?page=10,"The Baltic Hub, formerly DCT Gdansk have commissioned Liebherr Container Cranes Ltd. to retrofit a hybrid green energy storage solution on one of its Liebherr RTGs. The terminal has 18 Liebherr RTGs at the port and the initial purchase will allow the Baltic Hub to assess the technology with a view to further retrofitting its fleet of Liebherr RTG with the system.Find out more",Press releases,03/10/2023,"The retrofit sees the addition of a Liduro energy storage system along with exchanging the existing 13 L genset with a smaller 8 L genset. This will allow the RTG to operate at the same speed and productivity, whilst reducing operating costs, and delivering substantial environmental benefits, including a reduction in emissions and carbon footprint.According to Oran Kane, Liebherr’s Container Cranes Head of Department for Upgrades and Modifications, the retrofitting of the Liduro energy storage system is a natural choice.“Baltic Hub, like many ports and terminals worldwide are working to minimise their impact on the environment, through reducing their carbon footprint. The green energy solution that they have chosen, not only makes a significant reduction in the amount of energy consumed and the amount of emissions released, but the return on investment is clear to see, with the retrofit paying for itself in the short term. With such benefits on offer, the green energy retrofit is an easy win for our customers. The technology represents the future of energy storage in container handling, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this innovation.”. Regenerated powerAt the heart of the system is the Liduro LES 200, a capacitor system designed and developed by Liebherr-Electronics and Drives GmbH. The system is designed to capture and store energy generated during hoist lowering and braking that would otherwise be wasted. The stored energy is then deployed during the hoisting cycle to reduce the overall demand on the genset, allowing for a reduction in fuel consumed and a reduction in emissions. Dual layer capacitors are capable of rapidly charging and discharging many times, without a drop in performance, making them an ideal solution for applications requiring high power and short-duration energy storage, such as that found in container handling.By utilising this innovative technology, the RTG crane will have access to reliable, high-power energy during peak demand periods. The system is modular and depending on the operational requirements of the port, single or multiple units may be installed to a single RTG.The Liduro energy storage system is available on new Liebherr RTGs or can be retrofitted to existing Liebherr RTGs through Liebherr specialist retrofit and upgrade teams, Liebherr Transform..

"""The rooster sheave adds the last few centimetres"" ",Press releases |03/10/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-rooster-sheave-adds-the-last-few-centimetres.html?page=10,A mighty Liebherr tower crane was erected to carry out conversion work on a castle in the Swiss municipality of Rapperswil-Jona. A mobile crane of the type LTM 1450-8.1 provided the necessary power in this medieval town on Lake Zurich.Find out more,Press releases,03/10/2023,"For extensive conversion work on Rapperswil Castle, a large type 172 EC-B construction crane had to be erected. For this to be possible, a large gantry first had to be assembled to create a set-up area for the tower crane. The topography around the 800-year-old complex, which towers over the old town of Rapperswil-Jona, did not allow access by lorry or with heavy machinery, which meant the assembly work could only be carried out at an extended distance. The Liebherr LTM 1450-8.1 mobile crane from Feldmann Pneukran + Transport AG, based in Bilten east of Lake Zurich, was used for this task. Over a distance of almost 50 metres, the modern mobile crane had to lift the parts of the steel substructure and the individual components of the top-slewing crane to the construction site.Thanks to the hydraulically adjustable VarioBallast® system, only 104 tonnes of counterweight at maximum radius were sufficient for the LTM 1450-8.1 to handle even the heaviest loads during this job. The construction crane's 60-metre-long main boom represented the heaviest of the components with a gross load of ten tonnes. The only shortage of telescopic length occurred when the slewing ring was installed at a hook height of almost 70 metres. To compensate for this, the Feldmann team had fitted a rooster sheave to the pulley head on the telescopic tip of the mobile crane. ""The rooster sheave effectively gives us about 80 to 90 centimetres more radius and saves us having to add a lattice jib,"" explained Manfred Moosmann, Feldmann's crane driver on the LTM 1450-8.1.Disassembly of the construction crane planned for the coming yearNot only did Moosmann and his powerful mobile crane assemble the construction crane and portal, which will allow public access to the castle grounds during the renovation work, but they also equipped the construction site with containers and other materials in two days, which were hoisted into position from the lower-lying old town. The plan is to erect the LTM 1450-8.1 once again between the picturesque houses of the old town in summer 2024, in order to dismantle the crane once the work on the medieval fortress building has been completed.Feldmann Pneukran + Transport AG has three locations in the region around Lake Zurich, which it uses for activities focusing on crane work, heavy transport and assembly technology. The company has two dozen mobile cranes and mobile construction cranes in operation. Among them is the first Liebherr mobile crane of the type LTM 1300-6.3 to be delivered..

Hüffermann Krandienst: flat-top cranes from Liebherr prove their flexibility in use,Press releases |03/09/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/hueffermann-krandient-flat-top-cranes-from-liebherr-prove-their-flexibility-in-use.html?page=10,"Hüffermann Krandienst GmbH has built up a comprehensive rental fleet with new Liebherr tower cranes and further expanded its selection at Bauma 2022. The machines are put to work on variety of construction projects, as three examples from Germany show.Find out more",Press releases,03/09/2023,"A fascinating building project has been under way at the Allwetterzoo in Münster, namely a tropical zoo environment housing plants, water sources and animals under a large foiled dome structure. The elliptical building covers 4,000 square metres and reaches a height of 16 metres at its highest point. A Liebherr 172 EC-B 8 flat-top crane with a freestanding hook height of 39 metres, a 60-metre radius, and a maximum lifting capacity of eight tonnes has played a key part in construction.“The crane supported smooth operations on site in the best possible way with its precise slewing and easy operation,” said Tjark Bethke, site manager and managing director at Windhorst Stahl- und Metallbau GmbH. His company designed and manufactured the dome. “All components were placed in exactly the right position with millimetre precision and without any problems.” He considers the crane an important success factor in the dome’s time-consuming and challenging assembly.Precise lifting with smart assistance systemsThe crane had to move heavy steel components for the dome and insert them with millimetre precision. The heaviest part weighed in at 4.2 tonnes and was around 49 metres long. This lift was mastered with ease by the Liebherr crane thanks to its responsive drives. When a load needs to be placed with extreme precision, the crane operator is able to activate Micromove, the crane’s fine-positioning mode. Micromove is one of several assistance systems designed for the safe and efficient handling of loads.It was essential for the crane to be mounted on a cruciform base. Foundation anchors embedded in concrete were not an option as special ground probes in the tropical enclosure made this impossible. The probes are part of the new building's regenerative energy concept. Heating is provided by geothermal energy and, thanks to concrete core activation, heat can be stored as well. The electricity required for the ground pumps and water treatment is generated by means of a photovoltaic system.Delivery via standard trucksSustainability also influenced the construction of a residential and commercial building in the centre of Oldenburg. More than 120 apartments as well as retail space and restaurant premises have been built to KfW Efficiency House 55 specifications on a plot of land measuring around 2,700 square metres. A 172 EC-B 8 with a freestanding hook height of 39 metres and a 45-metre radius was in operation there for structural work from April 2022 to January 2023. A 125 EC-B 6 with a freestanding hook height of 24 metres and a 30-metre radius was also involved. Both cranes were mounted on foundation anchors due to the tight conditions on site.Logistics posed a particular challenge as the construction site was located in a pedestrian zone with narrow access roads. The cranes therefore needed to be transported with as few trucks as possible. This is where the EC-B series with its transport-optimised concept came into its own. All crane parts can be transported on regular trucks. Plus, the jib sections have compact external dimensions and can be cleverly stacked together to save on transport units.Compact head and quick assembly connectionsAnother 172 EC-B 8 from Liebherr is helping to build an office building complete with day-care centre and underground car park in the Überseestadt district of Bremen. The new building is part of a neighbourhood development project along the Weser River, which will include living accommodation, workspace, educational services, and leisure facilities. A Liebherr LTM 1120 mobile crane assembled the flat-top crane, which has a freestanding hook height of 38 metres and a 45-metre radius, at the end of September 2022. A compact head and quick assembly connections ensure that cranes in the EC-B series can be efficiently erected and dismantled. The 172 EC-B 8 is being used to install locally manufactured prefabricated façade elements as well as for other construction tasks.Optimal service is also essential when it comes to crane reliability. Liebherr offers on-site customer service with partners like Hüffermann Krandienst, together with decentralised logistics for fast response times. The construction project at the Allwetterzoo in Münster shows just how much customers benefit from this. “The service was fantastic. Assembly engineers came out on the same day to help us out,” said site manager Tjark Bethke. From the right choice of crane to comprehensive services, Liebherr Tower Cranes and Hüffermann Krandienst work hand in hand to ensure the success of their customers.About Hüffermann As a full service provider in the field of crane and heavy haulage logistics, Hüffermann supplies modern Liebherr top-slewing and fast-erecting cranes, including EC-B flat-top cranes and their fibre rope versions, for large-scale construction sites throughout Germany in performance classes ranging from 125 metre tonnes (125 EC-B 6) to 520 metre tonnes (520 EC-B 20 Fibre).

In this endurance test, they exceeded their previous service life by an impressive 25%.. ""We actually define the service life of our injection technology for large diesel engines as 15,000 hours,"" explains Nicolas Couanon, senior project manager for fuel injection systems at Liebherr. This corresponds to the standard for components used in off-highway applications. During the practical test in the Australian iron ore mine, the test setup also provided for replacement of the injectors after this period. ""However, the test protocols showed a continuously constant injection performance. Therefore, we decided that replacement was not necessary and were proven right - the LI3 exceeded its service life by an additional 5,000 hours with a new runtime record,"" reports Mr. Couanon.. Exceptionally reliable and robustThe LI3 common rail injector platform was designed by Liebherr's components product segment specifically for large diesel applications, operating in harsh environments. Harsh is certainly the right expression of the climate in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Summer temperatures of 40 °C and more are just as much part of the typical climate as flash floods or tropical cyclones - the best conditions for demonstrating the robustness of Liebherr's large diesel injectors.

In addition, the entire injector platform is continuously leak-free and tuned to minimise control leaks, which makes a significant contribution to engine efficiency. ""This is also confirmed by the results from the field test and show significant fuel savings,"" summarises Nicolas Couanon. ""Everyone involved was extremely satisfied with the results of the two-year test phase""."

ONE-Dyas chooses LiMain remote maintenance,Press releases |03/07/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/one-dyas-chooses-limain-remote-maintenance.html?page=10,"The Dutch oil and gas company ONE-Dyas is the first customer to purchase a Liebherr offshore crane, type RL 2600, in combination with the recently launched service concept Liebherr Intelligent Maintenance, LiMain for short. It’s a fully digital, remote, and semi-automatic maintenance system that saves the platform operator significant investment and resources. Thanks to LiMain remote maintenance, ONE-Dyas can remotely maintain the crane on the unmanned platform.Find out more",Press releases,03/07/2023,"The Dutch company ONE-Dyas will install the first electrified gas production platform in the North Sea, which will run entirely on offshore wind power. The N05-A project is part of the so-called GEMS area, an area approximately 20 to 80 kilometres north of the Ems estuary. The N05-A platform will run entirely on renewable energy from the nearby Riffgat Offshore Wind Farm, which reduces the emissions to near zero. This project makes an active contribution to the energy transition and to achieving the EU goals of the climate Agreement, in a safe and responsible manner. It increases the security of the local supply of energy and contributes to the local economy.ONE-Dyas will build a gas production platform, which will be equipped with a latest-generation Liebherr Ram Luffing Offshore Crane RL 2600. For the customer ONE-Days it was essential that the maintenance intervals of the crane did not negatively affect the maintenance concept of the platform. To avoid additional manned days, ONE-Dyas opted for Liebherr and the innovative service concept Liebherr Intelligent Maintenance, in short LiMain.. Minimise maintenance effortMichel Mens, Lead Engineer E/I and Rotating Equipment at ONE-Dyas, explains: “We have made a strategic decision to purchase the RL 2600 in combination with LiMain’s innovative remote maintenance concept. Our aim is to minimise the maintenance effort significantly, but at the same time to ensure a service life of the crane of more than 20 years. With LiMain’s Module 4, Liebherr offers a solution that is unique on the market and precisely tailored to our crane, the RL 2600. The ability to operate the crane remotely helps to monitor the crane’s performance and prevents unforeseen issues during the maintenance visits.”Liebherr Intelligent MaintenanceWith LiMain, maintenance can be carried out remotely, from land. Manned service visits on site at the crane can thus be reduced to a minimum. This way of performing service with LiMain is contemporary because it reduces costs, protects the environment by significantly reducing travel expenses, and at the same time ensures a long and sustainable use of the unit. Maintenance independent of time and place is possible. Platform operators can choose from various modules and so determine the degree of autonomy and scope of intelligent maintenance for the crane. After delivery and assembly, the platform operator can subsequently monitor and maintain the entire offshore crane fleet from the office.“The cooperation with ONE-Dyas so far has been highly professional and we look forward to a future partnership. The customer has recognised the tremendous benefits that LiMain offers platform operators in reducing operational costs. In addition, with its low height and small footprint, the ordered RL 2600 is the ideal crane for such platforms,” says Stefan Schneider, Global Application Manager General Purpose Offshore Cranes.The latest generation of the RL 2600The particularly weight-optimized and compact design is the characteristic feature of the RL series. On both fixed and floating offshore installations, especially in the wind power industry and in the oil and gas sector, RL cranes are mainly used for maintenance and supply work.Based on customer feedback, Liebherr optimised the RL to become the most compact maintenance crane. This results in a reduced construction height and a small tail radius. The elimination of a machinery house allows the crane to operate in confined space conditions and environments. Additionally, the crane can be ex-certified (ATEX and IECEx).. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

An LTM 1070-4.2 and an LTM 1160-5.2 will replace older cranes of the same load class.Find out more,Press releases,03/06/2023,"Since its foundation more than 80 years ago, the family-owned company Staas has focused on consistency. Its vehicles and machines are regularly serviced and maintained to ensure they work reliably for many years. When selecting suppliers, Staas looks for durable products and first-class service. Over the years, the company from Lower Saxony has mainly procured mobile cranes from Liebherr.Now Staas has retired its last mobile crane not bearing the Liebherr logo and replaced it with a Liebherr LTM 1070-4.2. On the one hand, the 70-tonner is a tried-and-tested machine, but on the other, Liebherr has continually updated it to the latest technical standards: for example, with ECOmode and ECOdrive for particularly low consumption and low-noise operation. In addition, the VarioBase® variable supporting base is optionally available.The new LTM 1160-5.2 replaces an older Liebherr 160-tonne crane. The LTM 1160-5.2 offers a maximum lifting capacity of 180 tonnes and is now the most powerful crane in the Staas fleet. In addition to other Liebherr innovations, it offers the impressive VarioBallast®: mechanically slewing ballasting cylinders enable the ballast radius to be changed quickly between two different settings. The small ballast radius is optimal for confined construction sites, while the large radius enables the crane to achieve its maximum performance.""We tend to keep our cranes longer than some other crane operators, some of whom replace them after just three to four years, but our strategy is nevertheless to continuously renew our fleet. With Liebherr, we have a reliable partner for this. Their cranes retain their value very well and the Liebherr service is exemplary. Their fitters are on site quickly and spare parts are delivered promptly. I've had the same positive experience with Liebherr since 1986,"" reports Andreas Butt, authorised signatory at Heinrich Staas GmbH.Staas was founded in 1939 as a transport company.

Solidlink: New global brand name for fully automatic quick coupling system from Liebherr,Press releases |03/06/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/solidlink-new-global-brand-name-for-fully-automatic-quick-coupling-system-from-liebherr.html?page=11,Liebherr will now market its well-known LIKUFIX globally with the brand name Solidlink. The quick coupling system will retain the LIKUFIX brand name in German and French-speaking countries. The time-tested quick coupling system delivers maximum efficiency and safety for customers for changing attachments. Solidlink or LIKUFIX is suitable for use both with Liebherr products and with machines from other manufacturers. Find out more,Press releases,03/06/2023,"Liebherr's quick coupling systems, which have been tried and tested for decades and are constantly undergoing advanced development, deliver maximum efficiency, safety and flexibility. Almost any hydraulic or mechanical attachment can be changed conveniently, quickly and easily. In its global markets, Liebherr is now marketing its fully automatic quick coupling system, previously known as LIKUFIX, as the new brand name ""Solidlink"".New brand name, proven technical systemA major advantage of Liebherr quick coupling systems is their versatile, manufacturer-independent application and combination options with a wide range of different earthmoving machines and attachments. “’Solidlink’ is a brand name which will be readily understood globally. We would like to use this to continue to establish our fully automatic quick coupling system in the future,"" explained Rudolf Arnold, Sales Director at Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH.Efficient, safe and convenient attachment changingThe fully automatic Solidlink quick coupling system enables attachments to be changed easily and conveniently from the driver's cab at the touch of a button. It quickly and safely connects the machine to the attachment to form a powerful unit. This message is also conveyed by the new brand name, adds Rudolf Arnold, and gets straight to the point in terms of the benefits: ""Solidlink increases the machines' possible applications increasing its capacity by up to 90%. The fully automatic quick coupling system therefore makes a significant contribution to both efficiency and safety on site.""Liebherr's quick coupling system also guarantees maximum safety thanks to a whole host of features. Solidlink is hydromechanically mounted to deliver perfect balance in all axes and degrees of freedom. Because the attachment can be changed from the driver's cab, the possibility of personnel being in the danger zone during the change process can be ruled out fully. The proximity sensor also monitors the correct position of the attachment in the locking position. If the pins are extended during coupling without the attachment tool being connected to the quick coupler, the machine operator is alerted by a warning sound in the cab and a warning signal on the display. Furthermore, the two-hand control process means that the machine cannot operate out of control during the coupling process and the safety risks this can create can therefore be ruled out.The high strength of the system is due to a solid metal plate and recessed hydraulic couplings that prevent damage during the coupling process. An optional bracket on the coupling block also protects the hydraulic lines.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Marcor Stevedoring closes contract on new LHM 800,Press releases |03/03/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/marcor-stevedoring-closes-contract-on-new-lhm-800.html?page=11,"Marcor Stevedoring has signed a contract adding Liebherr’s largest and most powerful mobile harbour crane to its dry bulk terminal in Rotterdam. The LHM 800 offers commanding and flexible performance, complemented by an electric drive and Liebherr assistance systems that will allow it to operate with a more environmentally friendly footprint. Additional digital interfaces and data connection features also make it overall more efficient and smarter.Find out more",Press releases,03/03/2023,"Liebherr’s strongest and most innovative mobile harbour crane helps mark the next chapter in logistical operations at Marcor Stevedoring in Rotterdam. On February 21, representatives from Marcor, C. Steinweg Group, and Liebherr met in Rotterdam for a contract signing ceremony. The new LHM 800 purchased by Marcor Stevedoring will play a key role in contributing to more economical and environmentally friendly operations at its forthcoming dry bulk terminal. The bulk cargo capacity of this giant is also unique at up to 2,300 tonnes per hour. Technical innovations in Liebherr’s latest-generation mobile harbour crane – including its electric drive unit, updated cabin, and more digital infrastructure – help ensure that current and future demands by the terminal can be effectively met. For example, it’s equipped for digitalised operating management and the integration of future assistance and partial automation systems. These benefits contribute to a more streamlined operation of the crane, saving time and costs for the operator.. Servicing new dry bulk terminal in Rotterdam, equipped for future innovationsFounded in 1997, Marcor is a professional dry bulk terminal operator that has so far had the unique characteristic of not having a shore facility at its disposal. Floating grab cranes and weighing towers have facilitated fast and efficient transfer of commodities to date. An expansion at the Steinweg Hartel Terminal, foreseen to commence operations through 2023, will encompass redevelopment and construction of state-of-the-art storage facilities onshore, with further plans to phase in sustainable and efficient storage and stevedoring operations at the site.C. Steinweg – parent company of Marcor Stevedoring – was also in attendance at the signing ceremony. “Our acquisition of a Liebherr LHM 800 for the Steinweg Hartel Terminal is an important step for us in ensuring that our bulk operations and services maintain strong growth,” states Ulf Boll, CEO at C. Steinweg Group, “we commenced the development of a new 160,000 cubic meter quay-bound bulk warehouse, and these are directly reachable through a single manipulation crane grab. Size, performance, and mobility were therefore important factors in our investment decision. The crane’s electric motor and Liebherr’s service offering rounded off this package. The fact that it’s fully electric is also aligned with our ESG strategy and our path to a carbon neutral operation. We’re excited to see the LHM 800 in action at our terminal and look forward to a productive future with Liebherr as a partner.”The expanded terminal will feature 130,000 m2 of space, a 600-metre quay with 16-metre draft alongside, and vessel handling options from barges up to 120,000 DWT baby-cape vessels, both for board-to-board transshipment and discharge to/from the terminal. Its development also supports a more sustainable operating model, including electrified shore cranes and conveying equipment, with 11,000 m2 of solar panels being installed already.“We’re pleased to support Marcor Stevedoring’s Rotterdam terminal with our newest LHM 800,” notes Andreas Ritschel, Deputy Sales Director for Liebherr Mobile Harbour Cranes, “among its innovations is the ability to interface with more components, making it possible to provide handling performance through electric power and offer smarter fleet management and maintenance overall. This will help save resources over time. Our network of skilled service technicians will also contribute to the machine’s long and productive life here in Rotterdam.”The terminal is perfectly suited for the LHM 800, which can utilize an electrified infrastructure and empowers Marcor to handle larger quantities of bulk materials with a farther reach and reduced environmental costs. The two E-drive motors are installed internally within the crane’s engine room and are therefore protected from the elements, another benefit for the major bulk operations ahead..

Wasel decides on two new Liebherr mobile construction cranes for further growth,Press releases |03/03/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/wasel-decides-on-two-new-liebherr-mobile-construction-cranes-for-further-growth.html?page=11,"Liebherr has delivered two new mobile construction cranes to Wasel GmbH: an MK 88-4.1 and an MK 140 Plus. Based in Bergheim near Cologne, the crane company plans to expand further in the next few years.Find out more",Press releases,03/03/2023,"Wasel has been a dealer for Liebherr tower cranes for over 65 years and has also opted for Liebherr mobile construction cranes for many years. And now two more have joined the fleet. “We're impressed by the MK concept. So it was clear to us that mobile construction cranes would also be part of our growth strategy,” said managing director Matthias Wasel at the handover. “The new mobile construction cranes optimally meet our customers’ requirements in terms of efficient and trouble-free crane operation.”Taxi crane concept for fast deploymentThe new taxi cranes mean Wasel can efficiently manage several construction sites in one day, as only one person is needed for travel, assembly and operation. The machines automatically unfold at the push of a button within just a few minutes, and without the need for any other resources. Wasel plans to primarily use the new cranes for jobs in the petrochemical industry and in urban areas, for projects such as roofing and façade work. The mobile construction cranes can be erected directly at buildings, thereby making optimal use of their jib length.MK 88-4.1 with ecological hybrid power conceptThe environmentally responsible use of construction machinery is becoming ever more important for building projects. The MK 88-4.1, which features a maximum lifting capacity of eight tonnes, scores particularly well in this respect. Thanks to its hybrid power concept, the crane can work with site electricity or another local power source without generating any CO2 emissions.Plus, it's particularly quiet in electric operation, which can be a particular advantage for night-time construction sites in residential areas. If an external power source isn’t available, an efficient diesel generator ensures self-sufficient operation. The MK 88-4.1 offers a hook height of up to approx. 59 metres (45-degree luffed position) and a maximum radius of 45 metres.MK 140 Plus for extra-long reachThe MK 140 Plus easily copes with situations where a longer reach is required. Liebherr's largest mobile construction crane offers a jib length of 58.5 metres in trolley mode. Luffing mode even makes a radius of up to 65 metres possible. A special feature of the MK 140 Plus, which can lift a maximum of eight tonnes, is its VarioJib function. This allows the crane to be operated flexibly in trolley or luffing mode, according to requirements. While trolley mode enables strong handling performance in trolley operation, a hook height of up to 94.4 metres is possible in luffing mode.Both the superstructure and the undercarriage of the MK 88-4.1 and MK 140 Plus can be powered by HVO, a fuel produced from hydrogenated vegetable oils, and preferably from waste. Our production sites started delivering mobile construction cranes with this fuel last year. Fuelling with HVO helps to reduce emissions and promotes climate neutrality on construction sites in the long term.About WaselWasel GmbH offers a full range of services in the field of heavy duty logistics from its base in Bergheim, Rhineland, as well as ten other locations. Wasel is also a dealer for Liebherr tower cranes.

The powerful 220 kW motor and automatic power adjustment make it a high-performance machine equally at home on all types of ground.The glazed operator’s cab of the R 945 offers a panoramic view of the working area, whatever the working situation. The windows are tinted to optimally protect the operator from the effects of temperature and glare. The cab has also been adapted to the standards in force on site. So, for example, a HEPA filtration system – mandatory on all mining sites in New Caledonia – has been installed to prevent asbestos particles from getting into the cab.Follow-up orders placed by YADAMWA: our customer was convinced by the quality and reliabilityLast year, our customer from New Caledonia purchased its first Liebherr machine for earthmoving at its open cast mine as well as for loading dump trucks, areas in which YADAMWA specialises. The R 945 has since been followed by two other Liebherr models. In addition, the customer opted to buy a used PR 724 bulldozer, which is operated by one of its subsidiaries. YADAMWA particularly appreciates the quality and reliability of Liebherr machines, which set them apart from the competition.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr automates disassembly of battery packs,Press releases |03/02/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-automates-disassembly-of-battery-packs.html?page=11,"In 2030, the batteries of an estimated four million electric vehicles will reach the end of their useful life. The lithium-ion batteries contain valuable raw materials, and recycling them makes both ecological and economic sense. Up to now, however, the disassembly of the battery system has still been complex and expensive as the separation of the components is usually done manually. This is where Liebherr-Verzahntechnik GmbH comes in. The company is developing strategies and processes for the automated disassembly of battery packs and is a partner in the federal government-funded research project “ZIRKEL”, which investigates the entire circular economy of traction batteries.Find out more",Press releases,03/02/2023,"Lithium-ion vehicle batteries are taken out of circulation once their total capacitance has reached about 70-80% of their original capacitance (state-of-health). The majority of these batteries are recycled and the raw materials are returned to the material cycle for the production of new batteries. Depending on their condition, a small proportion of the old batteries are reused in battery-electric vehicles (remanufacturing) or in second-life applications such as stationary battery storage systems. When they have finally reached the end of their useful life, the new EU Battery Regulation stipulates recycling quotas and minimum quantities of reused raw materials in new production. The industry must find the most efficient solutions possible for returning them to the material cycle, especially since the volumes of batteries returned will increase significantly in the future. The aim is to achieve a sustainable, CO₂-neutral battery production along the entire process chain with unlimited reuse of materials in a closed product life cycle. This is intended to minimize waste products and dependence on important primary materials.High recycling rates through automationDue to the relatively low quantities and large number of variants of diverse manufacturers and product generations, many disassembly and remanufacturing processes still take place manually today. “We are almost talking here about a batch size of 1 in the return flow of battery packs,” explains Jan Pollmann, development engineer for automation systems at Liebherr. In order to achieve a high recycling rate and to be able to process the increasing return volumes economically, it is necessary to automate the processes. Another aspect is occupational health and safety: automated disassembly ensures the health and safety of employees and excludes their exposure to high voltage, hazardous substances or fire risks.. Liebherr develops automated disassembly processes for battery packsThe “ZIRKEL” research project, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), involves an interdisciplinary consortium from research and industry to investigate the entire recycling management of batteries. As part of this project, Liebherr is developing strategies and processes for the automated disassembly of battery packs. The aim is to recover and recycle the highest possible proportion of raw materials by mechanically disassembling and sorting the components. By removing valuable components or those containing pollutants at an early stage, the cost- and energy-intensive pyro- and hydrometallurgical processing of the so-called black mass, i.e. the raw material mixture that remains after the batteries have been shredded, is reduced.Automation challenges In addition to the variety of batteries, a number of other challenges exist for an automated disassembly process: used batteries can be corroded, deformed or damaged. Contaminated components are sometimes difficult for vision systems to detect. Sealants, adhesives or heat-conducting pastes change their consistency and properties over time and may be difficult to remove. Risks such as high-voltage or hazardous substances must be taken into account. And finally, the disassembly of flexible parts such as cables or cooling hoses is difficult to automate. “In principle, the established assembly process runs backwards here, but it is many times more complex,” explains Viktor Bayrhof, Product Manager for Automation Systems at Liebherr.. Pilot plant for the “ZIRKEL” joint projectLiebherr's first pilot plant will be installed at the Open Hybrid LabFactory research campus in Wolfsburg in July 2023. Liebherr will continue to support the project there and carry out further test series. The results will be incorporated into a planned industry guideline for recyclable battery product design. “We are pleased to be able to contribute our process expertise in the field of automation to this future-oriented project,” explains Jan Pollmann..

Nine new Liebherr cranes for the next Wiesbauer generation,Press releases |03/01/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/nine-new-liebherr-cranes-for-the-next-wiesbauer-generation.html?page=11,"Wiesbauer GmbH & Co.KG has added a Liebherr LR 1700-1.0 to its crawler crane fleet. At the end of December, the new 700-tonner was able to prove itself in its first operation in Marbach am Neckar. At the same time, the company based in Bietigheim-Bissingen has ordered eight mobile cranes with lifting capacities from 70 to 650 tonnes from Liebherr in order to rejuvenate and, in some cases, expand its fleet.Find out more",Press releases,03/01/2023,"""As we already have a 650-tonne and a 1,000-tonne crawler crane in our fleet, the LR 1700-1.0 is the ideal addition to the mid-range of our crawler crane portfolio,"" explains Marco Wilhelm, authorised signatory and head of technology at Wiesbauer.Wiesbauer has procured the LR 1700-1.0 for the assembly of wind turbines as well as for use in infrastructure and industrial projects. ""We see this crane class and this type of crane as very future-oriented in terms of lifting capacity and innovative boom systems. We are also impressed by the clever design features that are standard with a Liebherr,"" adds Marco Wilhelm.During the first operation, Wiesbauer used the new LR 1700-1.0 with its innovative derrick system. The V-frame ballasting system is a hydraulically adjustable folding frame which enables the ballast radius of the LR 1700-1.0 to be infinitely adjusted between 13 and 21 metres. A rigid ballast guide is thus no longer required for large radii. For the construction of an electrical power plant in Marbach am Neckar, the LR 1700-1.0 lifted a 230-tonne transformer off a ship. ""We were very satisfied with the performance of the new LR 1700-1.0 during this first job,"" explains Jochen Wiesbauer, who planned this crawler crane operation.The company has enjoyed a good partnership with Liebherr for decades. Florian Wiesbauer: ""Together with Liebherr, we create goal-oriented solutions time and again. We believe in the quality and reliability of their cranes.""At the end of December, Wiesbauer ordered further cranes from Liebherr: two LTM 1070-4.2's, two LTM 1090-4.2's, two LTF 1060-4.1's, one LTM 1300-6.3 and one LTM 1650-8.1. They will rejuvenate Wiesbauer's fleet and in some cases also expand it. ""Through these new purchases and when making our purchasing decision, we placed great emphasis on the fact that all the counterweight plates on the smaller cranes and the booms on the larger cranes can be easily and quickly dismantled in order to achieve lighter driving conditions for the cranes, as the topic of vehicle weight, axle load and driving permits is becoming increasingly controversial throughout Germany,"" explains the Wiesbauer team.Management by the 4th generation: the crane family sticks togetherFollowing the sudden, tragic death of Thomas Wiesbauer in April of last year, the Wiesbauer family business is now under the joint stewardship of its third and fourth generations. In Sissy and Florian Wiesbauer, the fourth generation of the family has taken over the operational management side and works closely with Sabine and Jochen Wiesbauer. With around 90 cranes and a workforce of 180, Wiesbauer GmbH & Co.KG is a major provider of crane and heavy haulage logistics services based in southern Germany.Florian Wiesbauer: ""We already initiated the handover to the new generation two years ago. However, the death of our father has accelerated our repositioning. We are glad that, as a strong crane family, our team can master the current challenges."" Florian has already been working on the operational side of the business for five years. Sissy moved to Wiesbauer in July after gaining experience externally as a manager at another company. The great-grandchildren of the company founder Franz Wiesbauer want to provide new impetus and focus first and foremost on the topics of sustainability and digitalisation. ""We aim to counteract the shortage of skilled workers through modern approaches. We are also analysing our product range and will make necessary adjustments. We are open to new ideas,"" says Sissy Wiesbauer.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr slewing bearings ensure self-alignment of floating wind turbines,Press releases |02/15/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-slewing-bearings-ensure-self-alignment-of-floating-wind-turbines.html?page=13,The Liebherr components product segment is part of a revolutionary project by Ming Yang Smart Energy: The Chinese manufacturer of wind turbines and provider of integrated solutions for clean energy has produced the prototype of a floating wind turbine. And Liebherr’s slewing bearings take care of their self-alignment.Find out more,Press releases,02/15/2023,"The wind blows strongest on the high seas. To use this natural resource even more efficiently, the Chinese manufacturer of wind turbines, Ming Yang, is moving forward with “Nezzy²”. This is a 16.6 MW twin floating offshore wind platform, consisting of two 8.3 MW wind turbines. Their V-shaped downwind rotors have a diameter of 180 metres each. The rotors are mounted on a floating, self-aligning structure, which consists of an anchor buoy, mooring bearing and a steel structure (floating foundation). Due to a downwind configuration, also known as a lee runner, the wind can be captured from behind to assist the self-alliance of the turbines. The combination of the lee runner, the anchor buoy and the mooring bearing enables the self-alignment itself. The structures are anchored to the seabed by steel cables. An underwater cable transmits the generated electricity to the coast then. This technology opens up the possibility of erecting offshore wind turbines in regions with deeper waters.. The floating structure is as reliable as its land-based counterpart: To ensure the self-alignment of these turbines, the Liebherr slewing bearings function as a mooring-system. For this purpose, a bearing with a diameter of four metres is installed as a connecting element between the anchor buoy and the float below the sea surface. Because the slewing bearing has to withstand high pressure and corrosive environmental conditions, some components are made of stainless steel or welded on with stainless steel. In addition, the bearing has two sensors that can detect the unlikely event of water ingress – for example, when seals wear out – at two measuring points. One is located in the first lower chamber - the second in the second upper chamber of the floating turbine. In this way, Liebherr’s unique smart bearing lubrication monitoring comes into play and shows, whether it is necessary to intervene. In case of maintenance or repair, the float with the turbines can be separated from the anchor buoy and towed to a harbour. Thus, by providing such a mooring system, Liebherr does not only contribute to the efficient use of wind as a resource on the high seas, but also to easy maintenance of floating wind turbines..

It has always been important for Liebherr that customers can rely on our machines at all times and can work safely with them.This includes, for example, comprehensive work on modern assistance systems for earthmoving machines and cranes, which relieve the machine operator and thus make a significant contribution to work safety on the construction site. Under the slogan ""Safety first"", the mobile and crawler crane segment will be demonstrating the latest safety equipment and assistance systems that set new standards, using its LRT 1130-2.1 on display as an example. One of the highlights is the VarioBase® variable outrigger base developed by Liebherr, which is used as standard on all Liebherr-LRT-cranes and makes an important contribution to increasing safety. With VarioBase®, each individual crane jib can be extended to any length. Crane operation is controlled by a load moment limiter, which calculates the maximum lifting capacities precisely for the current situation.In order to also meet our claim to environmental compatibility Liebherr is working to continually reduce the ecological footprint of its products throughout their entire life cycle, from development to disposal. Today, the Liebherr Group already offers its customers numerous ecologically optimized products, some of which operate with zero local emissions. The basis for this is, among other things, our technology neutral work on alternative drives.At Conexpo, for example, visitors are able to experience the LB 30 unplugged from the deep foundation machines product segment. For battery operation and thus local zero emission, the charging cable only has to be unplugged and reconnected to the construction power supply for unrestricted operation. The battery is designed for an operating time of 4 hours in Kelly mode. Whether in battery or socket operation, the drilling performance remains unchanged.In addition, Liebherr Components will present a prototype of its hydrogen engine, the H964, for the first time in the USA. It employs a direct hydrogen injection also developed by Liebherr. This technology is particularly well suited for dynamic heavy-duty applications, since it offers high power density. Durable against dust, dirt and vibrations, as well as other harsh environmental conditions, the direct injection is comparable to the diesel engine in terms of performance and durability.Also from Liebherr Components, open circuit hydraulic pumps along with the successful high-speed DMVA double motor, featuring high power density and flexibility in control, expand Liebherr's axial piston portfolio for robust applications..

Liebherr laboratory mixers for the concretes of the future,News |02/08/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-laboratory-mixers-for-the-concretes-of-the-future.html?page=13,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr exhibited its innovative laboratory mixers at a separate hall booth for mixing technology. The mixers allow extensive testing and optimization of new concrete formulations. The results obtained here can also be transferred to the large Liebherr intensive mixers.Find out more",News,02/08/2023,"Concrete laboratory mixers enable practical trials that contribute to improved concrete formulations. The practical simulation of process engineering sequences is the basis for systematic solutions with reduced experimental effort at the same time.The new Liebherr concrete mixers enable developers of new concrete formulations or quality monitoring equipment to carry out mixing tests with realistic stress and movement sequences on a laboratory scale. A modern control system for the laboratory mixer, which can also be integrated into a customer's own digital environment, enables, among other things, the test sequence to be subdivided into individual sections, a clear display of the test sequence and the integration of different sensors such as temperature and moisture measurement as well as speed and force measurement. For further analyses, the data can be read out in a neutral format.The DW 0.06/100 twin-shaft mixer is designed primarily for distributive mixing. Especially for demanding dispersion tasks, the RIV 0.06/100 ring-pan intensive laboratory mixer is available with an agitator speed that can be regulated separately and independently of the mixing tool speed."
Assembly via helicopter: Liebherr flat-top crane at work on Mont Blanc ,Press releases |02/07/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/assembly-via-helicopter-liebherr-flat-top-crane-at-work-on-mont-blanc.html?page=13,"A new educational centre focused on climate change, complete with cable car, is currently being built on France’s largest glacier, the “Mer de Glace”. The transformation of the Montenvers station is intended to make students, tourists and residents even more aware of the effects of climate change.Find out more",Press releases,02/07/2023,"The flat-top crane's tower is in place. A helicopter delivered one tower section after another to the Montenvers mountain station up at an altitude of 1,913 metres, after the foundation anchor was secured to the massif. Four assembly engineers from Liebherr's partner FT Montage and six flight assistants from Heliswiss International took delivery of the parts from overhead, connected them and worked their way up to a tower height of over 40 metres. A spectacular panorama presents itself: rock faces, trees and ice fields sparkle in the sunshine. But the engineers have little time to appreciate the views from the foot of Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps and the European Union. The helicopter is on its approach with the crane’s slewing platform.“Assembly has been a true team effort that wouldn't have been possible without mutual trust,” says Guillaume Riband, Operations Manager France Centre East at Vinci Construction France. “Everyone has pulled together and risen to the challenge as a result.” FT Montage won the ""Trophée des Grues á Tour"" in the category ""Assembly of the Year"" due to the complexity and difficulty of the operation. The award is presented annually by the CPMDG (Professional commission for tower crane professions and equipment) from the DLR Federation.EC-B series with flexible jib length A job like this one with a 150 EC-B 8 in the middle of the Alps isn't something that happens every day. The crane, with a 45-metre jib and a hook height of 42 metres, will support the construction of the new cable car station and the International Glacier and Climate Interpretation Centre until June 2023. The new “Glaciorium” is to become the flagship attraction at Montenvers and will help visitors to understand the phenomena associated with global warming. The Montenvers redevelopment will cost more than 50 million euros and is due to be completed in December 2024. The project was designed to be of high ecological and architectural quality in order to minimise the impact on nature. In terms of energy consumption, waste disposal and visitor awareness, the project fulfils high standards.One of the biggest challenges the construction company faced was selecting the right crane. Originally, the site required a crane in the 250 metric tonnes range due to the loads that needed to be moved. This value is based on radius (m) and lifting capacity (t) and serves to classify the size of the crane. As such a crane is too heavy for helicopter assembly, Liebherr worked with customers Solumat GAT ( Materials Division, Vinci Group) and CBCE Grenoble (a local construction company that is part of the Vinci Group) to find economic alternatives. Depending on temperature and altitude, the helicopter can move a maximum of 3,800 kilograms.Fast assembly thanks to clever design conceptIn the end, Liebherr suggested the use of a 150 EC-B, as its counter jib, which weighs in at 3,600 kilograms, is light enough for the helicopter to manage. Plus, the flat-top crane can be easily dismantled into several individual parts thanks to its flexible design concept. Elements such as the crane’s compact head, slewing platform, cabin and control cabinet can all be quickly reconnected. The site's architects and the construction company also adapted the planning so that the loads to be moved wouldn’t exceed the crane's maximum lifting capacity of eight tonnes. This was in part achieved through the use of lighter concrete elements.For safety reasons, the Montenvers train, which dates back to 1910, was temporarily suspended due to the proximity of its power lines. The retro-style electric rack railway connects Chamonix-Mont-Blanc and Montenvers. It climbs steeply upwards for more than five kilometres and visitors reach the terminus at an altitude of 1,913 metres after approx. 20 minutes.Robust cranes for unusual tasksThanks to the right choice of crane, good preparation and a well-coordinated team, the assembly on Mont Blanc has gone smoothly. The unusual assembly of the 150 EC-B took around eight hours. During this time, a powerful Kamov KA 32 A11 BC heavy-lift helicopter from Heliswiss International flew back and forth 30 times to deliver all the crane parts and tower system elements.The delivery site needed to be easily accessible for trucks and offer sufficient space. The location chosen was an area in Chamonix on the Arveyron River, about 3.5 kilometres from the Montenvers mountain station. This relatively short distance helped to keep flight times, and therefore refuelling, to a minimum. “Precision planning has been key to this all-round successful assembly,” Guillaume Riband concludes.This is the second successful helicopter assembly for Heliswiss International and Liebherr. In 2015, they used a helicopter to transport a 150 EC-B 6 flat-top crane onto the Zugspitze to work on the construction of the new Eibsee cable car station. Up at an altitude of 2,975 metres, the crane marked Germany's highest construction site back then. The 150 EC-B 8 won't quite reach such heights in France, but sub-zero temperatures are expected here in the winter months as well. This isn't a problem for Liebherr tower cranes, which are designed for such conditions.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr crawler cranes from Grúas Aguilar erect retractable stadium roof ,Press releases |02/03/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-crawler-cranes-from-gruas-aguilar-erect-retractable-stadium-roof.html?page=13,"The construction of a retractable roof is one of the highlights of the renovation and reconstruction work at Real Madrid CF's stadium, the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.Find out more",Press releases,02/03/2023,"The legendary football stadium Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, home of the record champion Real Madrid CF, has been repeatedly rebuilt and enlarged since it was first constructed in 1947. Currently, the largest reconstruction project in its history is underway. The redesigned ultra-modern stadium with its hydraulically adjustable roof structure, retractable hybrid turf, LED-lit façade and new shopping, business and leisure facilities is scheduled for completion in the middle of this year.Liebherr mobile and crawler cranes from Grúas Aguilar are playing a key role in the modernisation measures. During the break in play caused by the World Cup in Qatar, the Madrid-based crane and transport company used two Liebherr crawler cranes to assemble the girders for the retractable roof. An LR 1700-1.0 and an LR 1600/2 lifted twelve 72-metre-long and 72-tonne cross beams to a height of 70 metres in tandem lifts. The two crawler cranes were positioned outside the stadium and had to cope with radii of 70 to 118 metres.The Grúas Aguilar team and its cranes also had to overcome several major challenges when carrying out this exceptional operation. In particular, the limited space around the stadium made it extremely difficult to erect large lattice boom cranes. Therefore, the boom of the LR 1600/2 had to be mounted in a car park near the stadium.Another difficulty was that the crane operators could not always see the cross beams when lifting them into the stadium. To ensure the success of the assembly, Grúas Aguilar's design department meticulously planned the movements of each girder in advance, taking into account the respective angles of the main boom and luffing jib of the two cranes in each phase.Originally, the assembly of the roof cross beams was to be carried out using a single, larger crane. After extensive testing, this plan had to be discarded due to, among other things, space problems in the vicinity of the construction site and the large assembly radii. Instead, Grúas Aguilar opted for tandem lifts using the LR 1700-1.0 and LR 1600/2 crawler cranes.""Having assembled the entire roof of the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, the completion of this job means the end of an exciting project for the Grúas Aguilar team,"" says company owner Luis Aguilar. ""The best feedback we can ask for is the fact that our customers have placed their trust in us day in and day out ever since we first started this special project four years ago. We also get great support from the Liebherr Ibérica team in terms of customer service and advice."". DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Interview: With mental flexibility to SmartMonitoring,News |02/01/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/interview-with-mental-flexibility-to-smartmonitoring.html?page=13,"The storage of refrigerated medicines, vaccines and samples requires a lot of time and attention. To ensure that professional medicine refrigerators cool reliably, a team of Liebherr software experts has developed SmartMonitoring. Sascha Herrmann, Team Leader for Browser UIs at the Refrigerators and Freezers Division of Liebherr-Hausgeräte Ochsenhausen GmbH, accompanied the project together with his team from the very beginning.Find out more",News,02/01/2023,"Mr Herrmann, what is SmartMonitoring for medical refrigerators and what is it used for?SmartMonitoring is Liebherr's cloud solution for monitoring the temperature of refrigerators in laboratories, hospitals or doctors' surgeries. With a conventional refrigerator in a kitchen, it is not that bad if you leave the door open for too long or if the temperature inside the appliance changes while you are putting away the groceries. In the medical field, things are quite different. Here we are talking about the professional and safe storage of medicines, vaccines and samples that require reliable refrigeration. Even the slightest deviations in temperature can have consequences for the treatment of patients or research in laboratories. SmartMonitoring therefore sounds the alarm if something is wrong and immediately notifies the user.In which cases does SmartMonitoring trigger an alarm? This happens when the temperature deviates from the temperature range set by the user. Depending on the contents of the refrigerator, this range can be adjusted so that an alarm is sent to the customer if there is a deviation of, for example, plus-minus 0.5 degrees. SmartMonitoring also warns if a refrigerator door is not closed properly or if the power fails in the doctor's office.What happens in this monitoring system in the event of a power failure? Behind SmartMonitoring lies a comprehensive cloud infrastructure that is managed by three Liebherr teams. Besides my team, there is also a pure cloud team and an infrastructure team. The refrigerators are connected to this cloud via our SmartCoolingHub and send monitoring data that is continuously evaluated. If the power should ever fail in a medical practice, the system registers that the SmartCoolingHub is no longer accessible and immediately sends a message to the cloud. This triggers an alarm that is sent directly to the user via email, SMS or voice message. This gives our customers a high level of security and monitoring and they can react quickly at any time.Continue reading ...Read the full interview with Sascha Herrmann here"

A continuing success story: Liebherr and GMVykon bring the first MK 88-4.1 to Mexico ,Press releases |01/31/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/a-continuing-success-story-liebherr-and-gmvykon-bring-the-first-mk-88-4-1-to-mexico.html?page=14,"Liebherr has delivered its first MK 88-4.1 to Mexico. The four-axle crane is a perfect match for crane company GMVykon’s upcoming projects. “We’re impressed by the great MK series concept and want to introduce it to the Mexican market,” enthused Managing Director José Victor Cortez at the crane’s official handover at Liebherr's Monterrey site.Find out more",Press releases,01/31/2023,"The agile MK 88-4.1 for GMVykon, which has a maximum lifting capacity of eight tonnes, is also the first of its kind to be put into operation on the American continent. The crane is particularly useful for short jobs in several locations. Pull up, unfold the crane at the push of a button, complete the lifts and move on to the next site after dismantling: the taxi crane concept makes this mobile construction crane extremely flexible.Extensive reach, minimal space requirements What's more, only one person is needed for travel, assembly and operation. Additional transport vehicles and tools are not necessary; another factor that contributes to its efficient use. The crane offers a maximum hook height of approx. 59 metres (45-degree luffed position) and a maximum radius of 45 metres. It also delivers a jib head load capacity of up to 2,200 kilograms. Owing to its vertical tower, the crane can be erected directly at the building in question. This saves space and ensures that obstructions for road users are as minimal as possible.The crane's future-oriented hybrid power concept is another advantage when working in built-up areas. It enables all-electric operation, with the use of site power, for example. This means that the crane is also especially quiet when working and doesn't produce any CO2 emissions. If an external power source isn’t available, an efficient diesel generator ensures self-sufficient operation. Both the superstructure and undercarriage drives can be powered by HVO (Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils).. Comprehensive customer serviceBy adding the MK 88-4.1 to its fleet, GMVykon has gained a versatile piece of equipment. “Liebherr has impressed us for years with its excellent customer service, top quality and outstanding technology,” said José Victor Cortez. The company fleet includes around 100 Liebherr machines ranging from 30 to 800 tonnes in lifting capacity. At present, its most powerful crane is a Liebherr LTM 1750-9.1 mobile crane. The close collaboration between GMVykon and Liebherr was evident when the MK 88-4.1 was presented in Monterrey. Customers of the Mexican crane company and Liebherr México were invited to experience the latest addition to the GMVykon fleet.“We have provided our service technicians with extensive training specifically for this series so we can offer our customers a reliable and fast service for mobile construction cranes in Mexico,” said Christian Tableros, Divisional Director Liebherr México S. de R.L. de C.V. This means that Liebherr is able to ensure efficient after-sales service, “As well as that, we are also in the process of setting up a spare parts warehouse for short response times, and we're working hard to further increase awareness of the MKs in Mexico.” As well as the MK 88-4.1, the series also includes the MK 73-3.1 and the MK 140-5.1.About crane rental company GMVykonThe Mexican company GMVykon has around 400 employees. Based in Monterrey, GMVykon also has further branches in Mexico City and Saltillo. The company specialises in industrial lifting work for maintenance, new build and expansion projects, as well as heavy haulage and project management. GMVykon has existed in its current form since 2009 and evolved from the former company Gruas Monterrey, which was active in the crane rental business for more than 40 years..

Right on track with Liebherr: 24 digital eyes for track construction giant,Press releases |01/24/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/right-on-track-with-liebherr-24-digital-eyes-for-track-construction-giant.html?page=14,"The Austrian track maintenance machines manufacturer system7 installs up to 24 Liebherr cameras in its lifting, lining and tamping machines. The MDC3 cameras show the hard-to-see areas of the complex machine, contributing to greater efficiency, comfort and safety during track maintenance work. For system7, Liebherr’s digital camera technology also means a further step towards automation and the improved cost-effectiveness of the machines.Find out more",Press releases,01/24/2023,"Track maintenance and construction machines have to withstand extreme mechanical and climatic conditions over decades. Therefore, all the components have to be resilient and durable to ensure the functionality of the machines. Machine breakdowns would be extremely costly and have for a significant impact on railway operations. The robustness of the components used also plays a decisive role for system7. That is why the internationally acting manufacturer of track maintenance machines has opted for the MDC3 camera by Liebherr-Components.A tough test for the cameras""We have been using digital camera technology by Liebherr since 2016. Track works are really challenging for all the components in our machines. In particular, they have to cope with strong vibrations, dust and temperature changes. The MDC3 camera deals with these demanding operating conditions in an exemplary manner. Should a camera be damaged, we can replace it quickly and easily in the field using plug and play,"" says Thomas Stadler, automation engineer at system7.For a more detailed view, system7 has currently installed up to 24 Liebherr cameras on its universal lifting, lining and tamping machines. They support the machine operators in monitoring not only the tracks, but also the work process. To ensure flawless track work, the operators must always keep the machine and working units in an exact position. For this purpose, several cameras image the tracks and the markings located there directly, actively supporting the operators in this task. In addition, system7 uses the cameras as a rear view camera and side mirror.. Multicasting - one image at several locationsTamping machines are equipped with several driving and working cabins. Therefore, some of them are located at a great distance from the track section, where works are being carried out. For system7, the so-called multicasting option in the Liebherr MDC3 camera is an important feature. The option ensures that the cameras stream the recorded images to several displays simultaneously in real time. This makes the MDC3 cameras ideal for keeping an eye on the tamping process from several operator stations at the same time and for detecting obstacles and disruptions in the workflow at an early stage.Sharp images in any lighting situationA large part of track maintenance and construction works takes place at night, when there are fewer trains on the tracks. The more important it is for a camera to deliver detailed image information, even under difficult lighting conditions. With its high-performance imager and HDR technology, the MDC3 always provides high-contrast and detailed images to the machine’s operator stations, even in dark environments. The MDC3 also adapts to new lighting situations, such as rapidly changing lighting conditions, including backlighting, very quickly.""Since the Liebherr camera of the previous generation has proven itself in long-term use, our machines now benefit from the features and high image quality of the MDC3. A sharp image with many details facilitates image interpretation, and thus ensures greater efficiency and safety in operation,"" adds Harald Hüttmayr, head of automation technology at system7.To round it off, Thomas Stadler takes a look into the future: ""The high image quality and the digital camera technology pave the way for further automation, which will make the use of the machine even more comfortable and efficient. At this point, of course, the low latency we can achieve with the MDC3 is also crucial."". DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr works together: LRT 1100-2.1 crane helps assemble Liebherr T 264 mining truck ,Press releases |01/23/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-works-together-lrt-1100-2.1-crane-helps-assemble-liebherr-t-264-mining-truck.html?page=15,"Liebherr’s LRT 1100-2.1 rough terrain crane with counterweight upgrade was brought to Liebherr Mining Equipment Newport News Co. site to assemble a T 264 Liebherr mining truck. The LRT’s high safety standards, along with additional lifting capacity with the upgraded counterweight made it an easy choice for the job.Find out more",Press releases,01/23/2023,"Liebherr’s LRT 1100-2.1 rough terrain crane was upgraded in 2022. The upgraded steel counterweight is increased by 1 metric ton resulting in an increased lifting capacity, allowing the LRT to hoist loads beyond what’s capable for the rest of its class. The counterweight is also more compact providing a better rear view in the cab, minimizing blind spots. This upgrade also allows for increased load charts as well as inclination charts, aiding in operation up to 2 degrees from level.The upgraded LRT was taken to Virginia to assist in quick assembly of an on-site mining truck. The rough terrain crane allowed for a smooth and rapid assembly of the T 264 mining truck and fulfilled any lifts needed at the site. Due to its top of the line safety features and high lifting capacity, the rough terrain crane was the top choice for this job. With no down time, the LRT crane also allowed the job to be finished four days ahead of schedule, saving both time and money.“It can be very hard to schedule cranes for builds like this,“ noted Thomas Coenen, Liebherr Mining Equipment Product Support Representative. “Auxiliary cranes are often shared and used for maintenance of heavy mining equipment and other lifting needs around mining sites. In this instance, I was able to use the upgraded LRT from Prillaman’s crane rental. Using one crane that can lift the truck makes the project easier, and we can complete the build faster. This also meant no downtime or crane changes for different components to be lifted.“. Safety comes standardA wide array of safety features come standard with the LRT, including the variable outrigger system, Variobase®, allowing safe operation of the crane with asymmetric outrigger positions integrated into the LMI (load moment indicator). The crane also offers LICCON controlled load moment limiter that minimizes accidents and human error as well as a monitored 2 hook operation which allows for safe rotation of loads.“At any mine site safety is the biggest concern,” noted Beau Pocock, RT Business Development Manager for Liebherr USA, Co. Mobile and Crawler Cranes. “Any operation like this is planned out to use the safest methods possible. That is why the Liebherr LRT is the right machine for the job.”The LRT also provides safe ascent to the crane with numerous handholds, a flat deck minimizing tripping hazards, as well as a larger cabin that tilts for better vision and ease-of-use on rough terrain..

Longer and stronger: Schäfer takes delivery of a Liebherr LTM 1090-4.2 mobile crane,News |01/20/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/longer-and-stronger-sch%C3%A4fer-takes-delivery-of-a-liebherr-ltm-1090-4-2-mobile-crane.html?page=15,Schäfer Kran- und Transportlogistik GmbH & Co.KG in Halberstadt has taken delivery of a new LTM 1090-4.2 mobile crane from Liebherr. The 90-tonne crane replaces an older 80-tonne model in the fleet of the Saxony-Anhalt-based company. The new crane offers greater lifting capacity and a longer telescopic boom as well as state-of-the-art crane technology from Liebherr.Find out more,News,01/20/2023,"Stefan Schäfer, the second-generation head of the family business, arrived in person to collect the new crane from Liebherr's manufacturing plant in Ehingen. He says: ""With the 60-metre telescopic boom of the LTM 1090-4.2, we can now do jobs which required us to erect a folding jib on the previous 80-tonne crane. In addition, the new crane is significantly more capable, especially with the adjustable VarioBallast®."". The LTM 1090-4.2 can be operated with two different ballast radii: 3.77 m or 4.71 m. The ballast radius can be reduced quickly and easily by 940 mm using standard mechanically adjusted ballast cylinders. The small radius provides a significant advantage in confined operating conditions, and maximum lifting capacities are achieved thanks to the large ballast radius.Another highlight of the 90-tonner from Liebherr is its ability to carry up to 8.8 tonnes of ballast with a 12-tonne axle load. This means it can handle a large number of assignments without additional transport. ""We can also rent out the new LTM 1090-4.2 as a 60- or 70-tonne crane without any problems. When we need more power, we can use a ballast trailer for the extra counterweight,"" says Schäfer. ""We were immediately convinced of the advantages of the new 4-axle crane when the LTM 1090-4.2 was presented at the customer days in Ehingen back in 2018. Technical advances such as VarioBase® und VarioBallast® increase the crane's range of applications. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, we then held back somewhat in terms of new investments.""Schäfer plans to use the LTM 1090-4.2 for typical crane rental applications, including industrial assembly, inspection work, machine relocation and container relocation.Stefan Schäfer's father, Martin Schäfer, founded the crane and transport company in 1990. Today, with four branches and around 35 employees, the company operates numerous transport vehicles and ten mobile cranes with lifting capacities of up to 130 tonnes. Seven of its cranes were built by Liebherr.Schäfer explains: ""We are very satisfied with Liebherr and we feel we are in good hands. Their service is competent and fast, spare parts are delivered quickly. When problems arise, Liebherr is approachable and solution-oriented. And in terms of technology, Liebherr is miles ahead. For us, it's a huge advantage that the individual crane types share similar crane controls. This means we can assign our operators flexibly to the different machines.”"
After electrifying visitors at Bauma: What's next for the Battery-Electric Arocs truck mixer?,Press releases |01/20/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/after-electrifying-visitors-at-bauma-what-s-next-for-the-battery-electric-arocs-truck-mixer.html?page=15,"The future of the truck mixer is electric. For several years now, Liebherr has been offering truck mixers with electric drum drive in the ETM-series, and fully electric truck mixers are also part of the range. At Bauma 2022, Liebherr-Mischtechnik GmbH presented the next development step in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz Trucks and the Paul Group: the prototype of the first electrified Arocs, the ""Battery-Electric Arocs"". What´s next for the prototype? We asked Alexander Pifko, developer of the ETM at Liebherr, and Nico Müller, product manager at Liebherr.Find out more",Press releases,01/20/2023,"What feedback did you get from customers on the Battery-Electric Arocs, when it was presented at Bauma 2022?Nico Müller: ""The Battery-Electric Arocs prototype attracted a lot of attention at Bauma, among visitors, in the media and not least among our customers. Basically, we are facing the challenge that construction sites will become increasingly low-emission in the coming years. With the Battery-Electric Arocs we are making an important contribution to CO2-neutral concrete transport and the construction site of the future. With its fully electric battery drive, the prototype also complements Liebherr's existing portfolio of alternative drives.“. What is special about this truck mixer prototype?Nico Müller: ""The Battery-Electric Arocs is the first fully-electric truck mixer based on the Arocs truck. It is an example of what can be achieved when experts from different industries work together. We were able to combine our expertise in the field of ready-mixed concrete with the vehicle technology know-how of Mercedes-Benz Trucks and the many years of experience of Paul Group in the development of special machinery.""Alexander Pifko: ""The result is impressive. The prototype was developed on the basis of the Mercedes-Benz Arocs. Both the truck and the truck mixer are fully electric. With its up to seven battery packs, the Battery-Electric Arocs can achieve a range of up to 200km including continuous operation of the superstructure on the construction site. Our ETM-905 electric truck mixer with 9-cubic metre drum is also powered by the truck's traction battery, eliminating the need for a separate battery for the drum."". How long did the development process take and when will the Battery-Electric Arocs be available on the market? Alexander Pifko: ""Through our close partnership with Mercedes-Benz Trucks we came up with this idea together and with the experience of the Paul Group this project could be realised. A project of this magnitude naturally takes a certain amount of time from the idea to a prototype. We already started discussions a few years ago. At the end of 2023, the first small series will go on sale. Flexible configurations will be available as 3- and 4-axle vehicles for the Liebherr truck mixer superstructure. After that, we will of course continue to work on the project to further optimise the Battery-Electric Arocs.""Where is technological development heading on the road to the construction site of the future? Nico Müller: ""At Liebherr we have a technology-neutral approach. We develop solutions that suit our customers as well as the application area of the machine and the business activities of their company. This can vary depending on the circumstances and the infrastructure on site. Therefore, we also want to help shape change here without losing sight of conventional models. Our know-how enables us to carry out parallel production of truck mixers with hydraulic (HTM) or electric (ETM) drum drive. In future, these can be married to both conventionally and electrically driven chassis. There is also the possibility of building on a gas-powered chassis, as we also presented at Bauma 2022."". .

Last crane finishes work on the Spin Tower in Frankfurt,Press releases |01/19/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/last-crane-finishes-work-on-the-spin-tower-in-frankfurt.html?page=15,"After three and a half years, the 230 HC-L 8/16 has carried out its last lift. With a final hook height of approx. 180 metres, the Liebherr luffing jib crane was the tallest crane on ""The Spin"" project in Frankfurt – and also the last remaining crane on site.Find out more",Press releases,01/19/2023,"When Liebherr's Tower Crane Solutions project department started planning crane operations almost five years ago, the dismantling of the 230 HC-L 8/16 was already on the agenda. To ensure a smooth climb down, the crane, with its radius of 55 metres, had to be able to negotiate the new hotel and office tower without colliding with it. And it needed to do so along a façade with multiple projections. The upper storeys are each at a slightly rotated angle compared to the lower ones so that the 128 metre-high tower doesn’t have a uniform, smooth-running exterior. On top of that, there was little leeway in the choice of crane location due to the confines of the construction site and the busy Mainzer Landstraße road.Minimal guying made interior outfitting easierTower Crane Solutions solved this challenge with just as much precision as the anchoring needed for the HC-L. The luffing jib crane was climbed on the outside of the building. “The guying required for this needed to affect as few hotel rooms as possible,” explains Julia Wiebeck, project manager at Tower Crane Solutions. Interior work on the hotel started while construction was still underway on the upper part of the tower.“If the guying had blocked too many of the hotel rooms, it would have been difficult to keep to the interior work schedule,” says Julia Wiebeck. Liebherr and the project developer Groß & Partner came up with a solution for this together. The 230 HC-L 8/16 was anchored to the building with three guy lines, two in the hotel area and one at office floor level. The crane climbed on a 24 HC 630 tower system measuring 2.4 x 2.4 metres. Positioned on a 6 x 6 metre gauge undercarriage, the 230 HC-L 8/16 was the only crane to climb on this project.High freestanding hook height achievedAnother 230 HC-L 8/16 was assembled in a freestanding position at a tower height of 84.3 metres. It wasn’t possible to erect the crane directly at the tower, which meant that there wasn't a way to attach it to the building for external climbing. This exceptionally high freestanding hook height could only be achieved by using strong foundation anchors together with a tower combination of 24 HC 630 and 24 HC 1250 tower systems. Foundation anchors were also chosen for securing the 150 EC-B 8 and 110 EC-B 6 cranes.“Given the inner-city conditions, all assembly steps for the two 230 HC-L tower cranes and the two flat-top cranes required precise planning, preparation and handling by our customer GP Con and Nagel Baumaschinen Frankfurt GmbH as sales and service partner. Working together with Liebherr Tower Crane Solutions, we always found the right technical and economically feasible solution,” says sales manager Jürgen Schmitt from Nagel Baumaschinen Frankfurt GmbH.“Work with Liebherr and Nagel has been all about competence, professionalism and customer orientation throughout, right from the initial crane concept through to dismantling the cranes. It meant that inner-city requirements could be met and complex construction conditions overcome,” says Dennis Ferdinand, senior construction manager at GP Con GmbH. “Planning the use of the two high-rise cranes allowed the climbing stages to be compensated for and an economical solution was achieved while still meeting performance requirements.”The cranes assisted in the construction of the tower and development of its surroundings. Featuring intelligent assistance systems, such as the Micromove fine positioning mode, the Liebherr cranes mainly helped with concreting, formwork and façade-related tasks. The luffing jib cranes were operated in 1-line mode for high and fast performance and were therefore able to carry out lifts with a weight of up to eight tonnes.A distinctive tower designAnd so, a new tower has been rising on the Frankfurt skyline since spring 2019. “The Spin” is one of three high-rise buildings that have now been erected on Güterplatz. A new place to live and work has been created between the trade fair centre and the main railway station on what had been derelict land for decades. The 32-storey Spin Tower, designed by top architect Hadi Teherani, offers space for a premium hotel, offices and a roof terrace with spectacular views.According to project developer Groß & Partner, the tower impresses with an accomplished visual separation of its two uses: Whereas the ascendant, smooth lower section will house the hotel, the upper section opens up with an angular floor design. It is this feature which gives the tower its distinctive character and name. The Spin Tower is easily accessible by public transport and the hotel is scheduled to open in spring 2023.Custom construction site solution The invaluable expertise of Tower Crane Solutions was crucial to the success of an inner-city construction project like this one. Projecting edges from adjacent buildings and tight construction site conditions required careful crane selection and precise crane concept planning before the start of construction. This meant that the limited available space on the 2,600 m² site was used effectively and efficiently for crane operations.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Salerno Container Terminals relies on additional LHM 600 to strengthen fleet,Press releases |01/19/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/salerno-container-terminals-relies-on-additional-lhm-600-to-strengthen-fleet.html?page=15,"The Gallozzi Group – parent company of SCT – and Liebherr are building upon a partnership that began around 2017. The new LHM 600 HR strengthens an existing fleet of four other Liebherr mobile harbour cranes. It will focus on container operations and is planned for 24/7 operation. The crane’s reliability and flexibility, as well as trust in the provided service, were among the main reasons for the customer to continue investing in Liebherr equipment.Find out more",Press releases,01/19/2023,"The Salerno Container Terminal (SCT) is a maritime gateway connecting worldwide container shipping networks to South and Central Italy’s import and export markets. It operated the first container vessel at the port of Salerno in 1977 and today ranks among the top Italian port facilities, supplying more than 40% of the country’s consumer population. SCT already benefits from a variety of Liebherr port equipment and mobile harbour cranes, including two LHM 800 and two LHM 600, both in the High Rise or HR version.The new crane is outfitted with a tower extension of 12 metres. Cranes of this variety benefit from a better view of the cargo/containers, thanks to a higher cabin, which is at 37.1 metres in case of the new crane. The pivot point is also higher, allowing for larger ships to be served. With the crane’s extended range, more container rows can be accommodated. The new crane also features VDL twin-lift spreaders with a capacity of 2 x 32.5 tonnes. The crane is thereby strong enough to lift two containers simultaneously. This allows for notably efficient operations in container handling. This shipment also achieved a remarkably fast turnaround time, with the order being completed in November and the crane being delivered to SCT on December 29, 2022.. Supporting maritime connections around the world“Today the level of competitiveness of ports is no longer measured only by referring to traffic volumes,” remarks Agostino Gallozzi, president of Salerno Container Terminal, “the so-called connectivity index is becoming increasingly important, that is, the number of different markets in the world with respect to which the port can guarantee a maritime connection in favour of local companies. Our use of Liebherr mobile harbour cranes has been invaluable in maintaining a strong operational efficiency and commercial capacity. And our continued investment in these machines has helped us achieve targeted growth and maintain a much stronger connectivity index.”Year-round operations at Salerno terminal for container handlingThe new LHM 600 HR will provide reinforcement on its quay for container handling and is planned for continuous operation. The mobile harbour crane has an outreach of 58 metres and is another strong asset to SCT’s port infrastructure, which is supported by four other Liebherr mobile harbour cranes to date. Two of those cranes can service Post-Panamax vessels and are able to handle up to 22 container rows across, equating to 15,000 TEU capacity vessels. SCT operates non-stop throughout the year. Container traffic increased towards the end of 2022, including a growth of TEUs of 11.64% and 11.16% in October and November, respectively.SCT has continued investing in its port infrastructure, now averaging 21 weekly container ship landings. With the terminal’s expanding operations, the new LHM 600 will help ensure that SCT can grow and meet future business demands.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Interview: Back to the future – the development of the LICCON crane control system,News |01/18/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/interview-back-to-the-future-%E2%80%93-the-development-of-the-liccon-crane-control-system.html?page=15,"LICCON, that is over 30 years of Liebherr history: with the latest generation of crane control for mobile cranes, LICCON3, Liebherr is ready for the future. But how did this crane control system come to be developed? We invited four experts for an interview, three of whom were present at the birth of LICCON in 1985.Find out more",News,01/18/2023,"The Liebherr experts know the LICCON crane control system like the back of their hands. Three of them are already in well-earned retirement: Erwin Morath built up the control department at Liebherr's Ehingen plant and headed it for decades. Max Leicht was the long-serving head of the electrical department and a specialist in production and assembly. And Karl Münst comes from crane practice, as he was responsible for the acceptance of mobile cranes for half his life. Klaus-Peter Brück completes the circle. While still a student, he wrote his diploma thesis on the introduction of the LICCON control system (Liebherr Computed Control) and now works as a software developer for control systems.. Why did Liebherr develop its own crane control system?Erwin Morath: When I first came to Liebherr in 1985, there was a range of different hydraulic, electrical and electronic control systems, depending on the crane model. We only had a simple system of our own to limit the load moment (LMB). We therefore launched the LMB from PAT, a wellknown manufacturer at the time. However, electronics were only available with analogue systems and did not feature any variable programming options. New plug-in boards had to be developed for each crane.Max Leicht: This plug-in board technology was only able to cover a certain amount of the crane control system. The requirements for the crane control system increased as a result of the ongoing development of our crane portfolio. That meant that new integrated circuits had to be developed on the plug-in boards. Over time, we developed around 100 plug-in boards with a range of functions. The whole thing became very difficult to handle, which affected both production and the supply of spare parts. A crawler crane, for example, required up to 24 different plug-in boards containing a range of functions.When was this and how did the development process take place?Erwin Morath: We took the first steps in 1985. We reduced and revised the existing analogue plug-in boards and developed programmable digital plug-in boards to replace them.Max Leicht: That was enormously important to ensure we could continue to manufacture cranes. We were able to reduce the number of plug-in boards to just 20 – a massive step forward.Klaus-Peter Brück: In the development of a new crane control system, therefore, one of the main objectives was to establish and retain the expertise we had within the company. What we needed was a flexible control system which we could extend and expand ourselves within Liebherr.Erwin Morath: The standardisation of the hydraulic and electrical control systems was another major step forward. Starting in 1986, we employed additional personnel who had the expertise to implement our concept of a modern microprocessor control system.continue reading ...You can find the complete interview with many insights into 30 years of LICCON's development here."
Liebherr completes lift height extension of STS in Australia and announces new Liebherr-Transform project in USA,Press releases |01/16/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-completes-lift-height-extension-of-sts-in-australia-and-announces-new-liebherr-transform-project-in-usa.html?page=15,Liebherr Container Cranes Ltd. is delighted to have completed their first ship to shore lift height increase with their new patented jacking system as part of Liebherr-Transform. The operation was conducted under the supervision of Liebherr engineers at Patrick Terminals – Brisbane Autostrad.Find out more,Press releases,01/16/2023,"Brisbane Autostrad located on the eastern coast of Australia is one of the world’s most advanced container terminals. Liebherr has two ship to shore container cranes at the terminal, a new STS currently being commissioned and an STS supplied in 2015. The 2015 crane has a supplied lift height of 37.5 m, but with larger vessels calling at the port, a lift height extension was required.Patented system for a quick turnaround Liebherr has been carrying out lift height extensions for many years, but in 2022 a new patented jacking system for lift height extensions, was deployed at the Brisbane terminal for its first use. Designed and built in Liebherr Container Cranes in Ireland, one of the key features of the system is that it uses the crane’s end carriage as a solid base for jacking the crane structure, eliminating the requirement for additional equipment. Furthermore, since the system uses the crane structure as a basis for jacking, the loadings are low and are carried through the existing crane.Preparation takes a couple of weeks and the flexible system allows the crane to be jacked in position or moved back from the rails for jacking if required. The actual crane raise and the insertion of the extensions can be completed in a number of hours and so is suited to terminals prone to high winds. The operation is exceptionally quick and the whole process can be completed from as little as four weeks per crane. Following completion of the project, the jacks are containerised and shipped onwards for their next deployment.. Major project in GCT New York LP in the Port of New York and New JerseyGCT New York LP operates four Liebherr ship to shore container cranes. Supplied in 2004, the cranes have a lift height of 36.57 m and an outreach of 50 m. Working in partnership with Liebherr USA, GCT will undertake a significant Liebherr-Transform project to extend the lift height of the cranes by 8.6 m and the outreach of the cranes by 5 m (two bays). When complete, the cranes will have the ability to work the largest vessels currently calling the port of NY/NJ allowing GCT to better service their customers.. Speaking about the project, Mr. Torsten Paas, Divisional Manager Liebherr USA commented: “We have worked closely with our customers in GCT New York to develop a tailor-made solution that will meet their growth needs over the coming years. In line with the well-known life expectancy of Liebherr cranes, GCT can expect many more years of quality service from their existing machines. The project serves as a clear example of the real-world benefits of Liebherr-Transform. GCT will benefit from extended operational ability of their cranes at a fraction of the cost of replacing their cranes.”Liebherr-Transform: unleash the full potentialLiebherr-Transform is the upgrade and modification service from Liebherr. Ports and terminals are under relentless pressure to reduce costs and boost performance through increased productivity, faster turnarounds, and reduction in equipment downtime.

Pick & carry – Eineder uses Liebherr LTR 1060 telescopic crawler crane in solar farms ,Press releases |01/10/2023,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/pick-and-carry-eineder-uses-liebherr-ltr-1060-telescopic-crawler-crane-in-solar-farms.html?page=16,Autodienst Eineder GmbH has been using an LTR 1060 since October. The Liebherr 60 tonne crane does most of its work in solar parks.Find out more,Press releases,01/10/2023,"Managing Director Peter Eineder explains: ""Its off-road capability and manoeuvrability makes the LTR 1060 ideal for jobs in solar parks. Its “pick & carry” mode is particularly good as it enables us to carry transformer stations weighing up to 20 tonnes straight from the transport vehicle to the installation site.” If the terrain means that the LTR 1060 cannot carry the load over it, Eineder uses a heavy duty transport crawler to move the transformer stations to the solar parks.Their design means that crawler cranes can travel on site with a full load on their hook. The crawler chassis also makes it easy to master difficult terrain. In addition to the 4.8 metre wide track, the Liebherr LTR 1060 can also work safely on a track width reduced to 3 metres using the crane control system. “That is a major benefit on constricted sites. We also appreciate the sensitive control of the LTR 1060 when things are tight”, continues Eineder.The Managing Director of the company based in Ingolstadt also praises how easy it is to transport the 60 tonne crane. The crawler travel gear can be retracted to a width of 3.0 m for transport. The low crane height of just 3.15 m ensures that economical standard semi low loaders can be used. The LTR 1060 weighs just 62.6 tonnes complete with turntable and central ballast. The axle loads for transport are less than 12 tonnes for a 3-axle tractor unit and a 5-axle low loader. By removing ballast, the transport weight can be reduced to the net weight of the basic 37.5 tonne machine. Axle loads of less than 10 tonnes can be achieved using a 3-axle tractor unit and a 4-axle low loader.Once at the site, the crane can assemble both the central ballast and the slewing platform ballast itself without requiring an auxiliary crane. “The LTR 1060 is a fantastic crane. Even as a 40 tonner without ballast, it is perfect for many jobs, including installing small transformer cabinets”, adds Eineder..

An LTM 1250-6.1 helps renovate the largest church in Hungary ,Press releases |12/19/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/an-ltm-1250-6-1-helps-renovate-the-largest-church-in-hungary.html?page=16,"A Liebherr LTM 1250-6.1 mobile crane from the Austrian crane company Prangl GmbH was used during the restoration of Saint Adalbert's Cathedral in Esztergom. Coincidentally, Esztergom is twinned with Ehingen, the headquarters of Liebherr mobile and crawler crane production – the LTM 1250-6.1 was also built there.Find out more",Press releases,12/19/2022,"The LTM 1250-6.1 owned by Austrian crane company Prangl GmbH was deployed on a special assignment in Esztergom, a city located in the north of Hungary. Besides being the former Hungarian capital, Esztergom is also twinned with Ehingen, where Liebherr builds telescopic and lattice boom cranes on mobile and crawler chassis. The LTM 1250-6.1 mentioned here, which is operated by the Prangl branch in Budapest, was also built there.One of the landmarks of Esztergom is Saint Adalbert's Cathedral. It was built around the year 1000 AD, but was destroyed in a fire in the 12th century. After it was rebuilt, the bishops had it enlarged and embellished repeatedly over the following centuries. After being destroyed again, it was rebuilt once more in the 19th century, which took 47 years. Today it is the largest church in Hungary.In the course of the current restoration of the cathedral, the large bell, weighing almost six tonnes, had to be lifted out of its tower so that the appropriate work could be carried out on it. To prevent damage to the windows and walls, it was necessary to remove the entire roof structure of the dome. An LTM 1250-6.1 from Prangl was given this task.""The time pressure was particularly challenging on this job. For the complete operation – all tower and bell parts had to be lifted out – the time window was limited to less than two days. The original plan was to use a smaller crane with an auxiliary boom. However, due to the time pressure, this was not possible. That's why we chose our LTM 1250-6.1 for the job. The work was no problem for the 250-tonne crane with its 72-metre-long main boom,"" explains Gábor Kopasz from the Budapest branch of Prangl-Hungaria Kft. At a height of around 70 metres, the LTM 1250-6.1 lifted the roof structure with its five extended telescopic sections and lowered it to the ground. This made it possible to lift the large bell out of the tower.Due to the limited space, the operation had to take place above a basement construction. In order to guarantee safe working conditions, the supports were underlaid with special steel base plates.The roof structure and the bells are being restored on site right next to the basilica. Members of the public can view the ongoing work from an observation platform. The reconstruction of the cathedral is planned for spring 2023.

Eight years ago, Mònica, one of the two original 15th century bells at La Seu Vella Cathedral in Lérida (Catalonia), was dismantled for restoration at the specialist workshop of Grassmayr in Innsbruck (Austria). A Liebherr LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane owned by the Spanish crane company Grúas Minguella has now lifted it back into its former position.Find out more",Press releases,12/19/2022,"The contract to mount the restored bell in its original position was awarded to the crane specialist Grúas Minguella in Lérida. The company's Liebherr LTC 1050-3.1 mobile crane took on this difficult task and lifted the 1.5-tonne bell, which is an essential part of the bell tower of Lérida Cathedral and also part of the historical heritage of ""La Seu Vella"", to a height of 40 metres with a radius of 15 metres.Challenge of work route""One of the main challenges for this manoeuvre was providing access to the work site for the crane. In order to get to the construction site, the LTC 1050-3.1 had to pass through two stone arches that are only three metres high and offer extremely little space,"" says Tomás Minguella, Managing Director of Grúas Minguella. The Liebherr LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane was a good choice for this job due to its compact dimensions, especially in terms of its height and manoeuvrability. ""To ensure the highest level of safety due to the historical value of the Mònica bell, we carried out a simulation of the lift in advance and worked out a special lifting plan,"" Minguella continues.528 years at home - return after eight yearsOn 7 May 2014, Mònica left her location for the first time since her installation in 1486. Due to a crack that could have caused it to break apart, the bell was transported to the Grassmayr workshop in Innsbruck (Austria) for repair. It wasn't until eight years later that it was finally returned to the top of the bell tower due to various bureaucratic hurdles – the tower is a listed building. ""For Grúas Minguella, it was a great honour to be able to support this project, because it allowed us to contribute to the history and development of our region,"" concludes Tomás Minguella.Grúas Minguella already active at La Seu Vella 25 years agoRaising the bell was not Grúas Minguella's first assignment at La Seu Vella Cathedral. Twenty-five years ago, the company used a Liebherr LTM 1030 mobile crane to carry out maintenance work on Mònica. However, since the boom of the LTM 1030 was shorter than that of the current LTC 1050-3.1, the 30-tonne crane was supported on stacked timber at the time, which allowed it to be raised by almost two metres to reach the required height.Grúas Minguella has relied on Liebherr machines since day one due to the latter's high-quality products and excellent customer service. The company has a fleet of 13 cranes, all built by Liebherr. Grúas Minguella was also one of the first companies in Spain to procure the Liebherr LTM 1450-8.1 mobile crane.

Liebherr large order: WASEL invests 60 million euros,Press releases |12/09/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-large-order-wasel-invests-60-million-euros.html?page=16,"As a new subsidiary of the Hagedorn Group, WASEL GmbH is continuing and expanding its close cooperation with Liebherr. In a new major order worth 60 million euros, WASEL has bought an LTC 1050-3.1E, an LRT 1130-2.1, an LTM 1750-9.1, an LR 1700-1.0 and an LR 11000, in addition to other Liebherr machines.Find out more",Press releases,12/09/2022,"As a new subsidiary of the Hagedorn Group, WASEL GmbH is continuing and expanding its close cooperation with Liebherr across all product groups. In addition to a large order for Liebherr tower cranes and, on the part of Hagedorn, construction machinery, WASEL has invested in several new Liebherr mobile cranes – including the two new cranes LTC 1050-3.1E and LRT 1130-2.1 recently unveiled at Bauma. The largest cranes in the package include the Liebherr LTM 1750-9.1 mobile crane and the Liebherr LR 1700-1.0 and LR 11000 crawler cranes.The two crawler cranes are already the second of their type in WASEL's fleet. ""Homogeneity in operator application and workshop operation, as well as ensuring trouble-free and efficient use by the customer, are really important to us,"" states Managing Director Matthias Wasel, explaining the investment in the Liebherr cranes. ""With the replacement and expansion investments, we want to contribute to the ongoing modernisation of the equipment fleet, taking into account sustainability aspects with regard to the emissions standard,"" Matthias Wasel continues. Together with his brother Thomas Wasel, he still manages the company's business.Zero emissions: LTC 1050-3.1E with electric drive The LTC 1050-3.1E with electric drive of the superstructure purchased by WASEL also plays an important role in sustainability and CO2 reduction. With this compact crane, which has both a conventional drive and an electric motor, crane movements can optionally be carried out with electricity. The new variant of the compact 50-tonner reduces CO2 emissions and meets the requirements for operation on ""zero emission"" construction sites. The compact crane retains all its familiar properties regardless of whether it is powered by the electric motor or the internal combustion engine.Another new crane in the large order is the Liebherr LRT 1130-2.1 rough terrain crane.

LiMain remote maintenance showcased live,Press releases |12/08/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/limain-remote-maintenance-showcased-live.html?page=17,"Well-known representatives from the offshore wind industry were convinced live of the benefits of remotely maintaining cranes with the help of LiMain – Liebherr Intelligent Maintenance. LiMain is a fully digital, remote, and semiautomatic maintenance system that saves platform operators significant investments and resources. Thanks to remote maintenance, platform operators can remotely maintain the crane on manned or unmanned platform.Find out more",Press releases,12/08/2022,"As the energy transition develops, wind farms are increasingly being built in offshore locations, making maintenance of all the necessary equipment a challenge. Automated intelligence is therefore becoming an effective solution to make offshore crane maintenance work more resource efficient. Liebherr recognised this trend early on and developed its LiMain intelligent maintenance concept in response.A new level of independence for manned and unmanned platform operators is provided by this maintenance system. Liebherr Intelligent Maintenance will enable anyone to maintain a crane on a platform without being on site. It allows operators to act whenever and wherever they are. Ideally, owners or operators would have to visit their platform for service only once during an entire year, which is an outstanding business advantage. Visits could be even less frequent depending on platform type and usage. This way, LiMain embodies the future workplace in a digitalised world: Maintenance work independent of time and space.. Live showcase in RostockIn autumn 2022, the new system was presented to well-known representatives of the offshore wind industry in a live show. An offshore crane of type RL 2600, located in Rostock, Germany, was controlled from Nenzing, Austria. LiMain was convincing throughout. ""Maintenance costs are a decisive factor in the offshore sector. Today's presentation has exceeded our expectations,"" comments Caspar Stein from Siemens Energy in Hamburg, Germany.Afterwards, all participants were able to pick up the joysticks themselves. The offshore crane RL 2600 could be controlled from the office building via a remote-control station. The participants were impressed by the precise control, which was made possible by the very low latency.. Modular systemThe foundation of LiMain is its modular system architecture consisting of four modules: Automatic Greasing, Condition Monitoring, Predictive Maintenance and Remote Maintenance Cycle. The modular package enables operators to determine the scope of intelligent maintenance that meets their needs.Automatic Greasing will continuously check critical components and automatically lubricate them when needed, even in complexly installed positions. Condition Monitoring benefits from sensor technology, detailed data about the crane as well as its components, and is monitored in real-time to deliver an unprecedented level of insight. Predictive Maintenance puts ad-hoc data into context, building on decades of experience from the construction of over a thousand offshore cranes. The module serves as the foundation for an optimised product and component lifecycle. Remote Maintenance Cycle represents the combination and interconnection of all the previously mentioned modules – the crane is remotely moved, and semiautomatic maintenance and self-diagnosis is enabled.With LiMain up to 75 % less mobilisation and up to 50 fewer man-days on platforms are possible. As a result, platform owners will save immensely on resources, whether on personnel, material, or transport.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Faster rail travel: Liebherr cranes help build the Filstal Bridge ,News |12/08/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/faster-rail-travel-liebherr-cranes-help-build-the-filstal-bridge.html?page=17,"Deutsche Bahn (DB) is set to open the new Wendlingen-Ulm line, and with it the Filstal Bridge near Mühlhausen im Täle, as changes to the rail timetable take effect on 11 December 2022. Four reliable Liebherr high-top cranes have been involved in the construction of Germany's third-highest railway bridge: a 280 EC-H 12 Litronic, two 280 EC-H 16 Litronic and a 630 EC-H 40 Litronic.Find out more",News,12/08/2022,"The Filstal Bridge consists of two parallel, single-track, prestressed concrete bridges and ten piers. A total of around 55,000 cubic metres of concrete and 7,700 tonnes of steel have been used for this project. The EC-H cranes from construction company Max Bögl assisted with various lifting operations, which included transporting concrete buckets, erecting supporting props and positioning formwork elements.The operating range limiting system ABB proved to be particularly helpful during the work. The intelligent assistance system ensured that the cranes didn’t slew over specified track sections and overhead lines. Test runs were therefore able to start on the completed side of the structure while construction work was still underway on the parallel-running bridge.Coordinated crane positionsThe Liebherr cranes worked freestanding on site with radii ranging between 49 and 75 metres and hook heights between 76 and 96 metres. Undercarriages with a ten-metre track gauge and a tower combination using 500 HC, 24 HC 630 and 256 HC tower systems made these remarkable freestanding hook heights possible. Thanks to the different radii and hook heights, the cranes were easily able to rotate alongside or over each other.Mobile cranes with high hook heights were used to dismantle the tower cranes one by one over the course of this year. As was the case during assembly, tight conditions posed a challenge. To make dismantling easier, the 630 EC-H 40 was climbed down from 76 metres to around 26 metres and then dismantled. All other cranes were dismantled without climbing.Travelling at up to 250 km/hThe Filstal Bridge is one of several structures for the new railway line running through southern Germany. Regional and long-distance trains will run on the new line between Ulm and Wendlingen, travelling at a speed of up to 250 km/h. The journey time between Ulm and Stuttgart will be reduced by 15 minutes. When Stuttgart’s new main station S21 opens at a later date, the resulting time saving is expected to be as much as 30 minutes.Reliable partner for heavy liftingApart from bridge constructions like this one in southern Germany, Liebherr's high-top cranes are also used for the construction of power stations, plants and larger buildings. The EC-H series is the perfect partner for when high lifting capacities are involved. High-performance drives from Liebherr's own production ensure excellent handling performance and assistance systems such as the Micromove fine positioning mode ensure that loads are set down with precision. This year has seen Liebherr extend the EC-H series upwards with its 1188 EC-H 40 Fibre crane. The 1188 EC-H 40 Fibre is also the first high-top crane to feature fibre rope."

We really appreciate the personal exchange and the fast, uncomplicated communication channels,"" emphasises Ralf Schmidt, shareholderand managing director of the technology department at LEONHARD WEISS.Overall concept of Liebherr machines convinced again: Solid, powerful and adaptable""We are convinced by the overall concept of the Liebherr railroad excavators. The machines have numerous advantages that had a decisive influence on our purchase decision. These include, among other things, the extraordinarily good stability when working with high payloads or the enormous performance of the machines in operation with hydraulic attachments,"" emphasises Ralf Schmidt.The construction company is also enthusiastic about the generously designed double cab of the machines. It not only offers a high level of user-friendliness and comfort for the machine operators in their daily work. Thanks to the large glazing in combination with the standard rear and side camera, it also ensures optimum visibility and thus better safety conditions in the working and slewing area.Another decisive purchase criterion was the high machine availability and Liebherr's excellent service network, especially with regard to the new EU regulation ECM (Entity in Charge of Maintenance). This is a mandatory certification system for the institutions and bodies involved in the maintenance of railway vehicles. Ralf Schmidt notes: ""Like LEONHARD WEISS, Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH and Nagel Baumaschinen Ulm GmbH are officially certified according to ECM and will thus continue to be available to us in the future for competent advice thanks to holistic, ECM-compliant processes.""The Liebherr railroad excavator: Top quality for versatile applications since 1967 Since 1967, Liebherr has been developing and producing railroad excavators to high quality standards, which can be used for both road and rail applications. With an operating weight of between 20,400 and 23,400 kg, the A 922 Rail Litronic is the smaller representative of Liebherr's railroad excavator portfolio. A rail undercarriage is mounted on both sides of the undercarriage. This brings the tyres to rail level during rerailing, with the inner wheels of the twin tyres taking over the travel drive on the rail.Equipped with the fully hydraulic quick-coupling system LIKUFIX® from Liebherr, which has also been in use at LEONHARD WEISS for many years, the excavator can work with a wide variety of mechanical and hydraulic attachments, which can be changed safely and conveniently directly from the driver's cab.

The 700-tonne crane is the fourth 8-axle model that the crane and heavy-haulage company from North Rhine-Westphalia has purchased from Liebherr since 2015.Find out more,News,12/07/2022,"“We’re looking forward to the LTM 1650-8.1 because you can do things with this innovative crane that were not possible before. In particular, the combination of VarioBase® and VarioBallast® opens up a far greater range of options – like achieving maximum performance on a narrow support base and large ballast radius. We’ve already had good experience with our LTM 1450-8.1 using this technology,” explains Eric Reichmann.The LTM 1650-8.1 will replace an LTM 1500-8.1 in Schares’ fleet. “The lifting capacities of the new crane are much better than the 500-tonner. It’s now the benchmark. There’s no getting around the LTM 1650-8.1. In some planning documents it is already mentioned as the predestined crane,” declares Reichmann.Schares is planning the new 700-tonne crane for bridge construction, assembly and disassembly of top-slewing tower cranes as well as maintenance work and shutdowns in industry and petrochemicals as its main areas of application. Reichmann reports: “We offer our customers solutions for complex lifting tasks and are happy to take on jobs that require a lot of planning. Our brand essence is to focus on solutions. Every construction site is different.”Schares is a medium-sized family business with four locations in North Rhine-Westphalia: Bocholt, Essen, Goch and Willich. The owner-managed company with around 130 employees offers crane rental, heavy transport and industrial assembly. Schares operates 50 cranes from 30 to 700 tonnes lifting capacity and extensive equipment for heavy load logistics. SPMTs (Self-Propelled Modular Transporters) were added three years ago. In the meantime, 40 axle lines are available."
Liebherr supports safety simulations at US operations,News |12/06/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-supports-safety-simulations-at-us-operations.html?page=17,"The Newport News Technical Rescue Team (TRT) visited Liebherr USA, Co. for three days to simulate various rescue scenarios with onsite heavy equipment.Find out more",News,12/06/2022,"Established in the late 1980’s, the Newport News Technical Rescue Team (TRT) has grown from 9 to 50 active members spread across the city supporting various emergency situations. TRT members not only serve the rescue squad, but are also active firemen in the city of Newport News.The team ran multiple emergency drills in Liebherr’s equipment yard to simulate heavy machinery accidents and emergency scenarios. The scenarios included lifting a crawler excavator off a victim and lifting a wheel loader bucket off of a victim. To do these rescues the TRT used a combination of Paratech air bags, Hydrofusion struts, and hydraulic pumps that are rated to lift up to 40,000 lbs. each. These drills specifically allowed junior members of the team to see what it took to lift heavy equipment and allow for rescue procedures in real time.Simulations like these are important to keep the rescue team prepared for any scenario they may face. “You get complacent doing the same drills over and over, and you go with what works instead of trying something new. Being at Liebherr allows everyone to use their thinking caps and work through the problem as a team with out preconceived ideas,” said Jason Carr, senior member of the TRT. Outside of heavy equipment rescues, the team also assists with other difficult rescues such as vehicle extraction, structural collapse, trench rescue and confined space rescue.. Why LiebherrLiebherr was an optimal choice for these drills because of the amount of large, heavy equipment available on site. “Newport News is always growing and Liebherr equipment can be found on just about every jobsite in the area,” noted Carr. “Having team members familiar with equipment will give them a head start and possibly save minutes during the operation and avoid pitfalls of not being around the equipment everyday.”Because of the success of the training, the Technical Rescue Team intends to schedule additional training this coming spring at Liebherr’s facility. The team performs regular in-house drills once or twice every three days and full shift drills every other month, but rarely does the team get the chance to perform heavy equipment rescue drills on the real thing. “This training is a good example of how we can all become safer by working together,” said William Boehm, Safety Manager at Liebherr’s Newport News campus. “Liebherr is always excited to work with community partners like the Newport News Fire Department and the Technical Rescue Team.”"

These comprise five LTM 1110-5.1, two LTM 1110-5.2, an LTM 1150-5.3, three LTM 1160-5.2, an LTM 1230-5.1, an LTM 1250-5.1 and an LTM 1650-8.1. ""The order for the 16 cranes will support the performance of our overall fleet. These new LRT and LTM machines will greatly assist us in meeting our ongoing customer enquiries while maintaining a fleet of modern, reliable machines,"" explains Raymond Cron, General Manager of Rezayat Sparrow. They will mainly be used in the construction, petrochemical, mining and renewable energy industries.Cranes supplement and expand the crane fleet in the upper lifting capacity rangeRezayat Sparrow already had two Liebherr LTM  1500-8.1 cranes in its fleet. Due to the company’s excellent experience with these two cranes, it decided to purchase their successor, the LTM 1650-8.1. “The higher capacity of the LTM 1650-8.1 is a logical complement to our two LTM 1500-8.1 cranes, which have proven to be the outstanding cranes in our fleet since 2004. At the same time, the new 8-axle can do even more,” says Cron enthusiastically. In a lifting capacity comparison, the LTM 1650-8.1 outperforms its predecessor, the LTM 1500-8.1, by 15 to 50 percent, depending on the equipment. The maximum lifting capacity of the LTM 1650-8.1 is 700 tonnes - 200 tonnes more than its predecessor. The new crane also tops the LTM 1500-8.1 in terms of maximum hoist height by ten metres, reaching up to 152 metres and maximum radius by four metres at 112 metres.Long-standing business relationship and Liebherr service the key Rezayat Sparrow and Liebherr have a long-standing business relationship. The majority of the contractor’s fleet is made up of Liebherr equipment. “We considered other manufacturers, but the support and service we receive from Saudi Liebherr Co.Ltd. is first class. We wanted to feel confident that we would have reliable support for our investments,” adds Cron.Liebherr has subsidiaries in Saudi Arabia as part of its worldwide service network. A state-of-the-art service centre was built in Dammam in 2016, offering the usual reliable Liebherr customer service from an experienced service team.Rezayat Sparrow Arabian Crane Hire Co.Ltd. is part of the global Rezayat Group of Companies.

Ten Liebherr tower cranes are helping to build the largest timber campus in Europe,Press releases |12/01/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/ten-liebherr-tower-cranes-are-helping-to-build-the-largest-timber-campus-in-europe.html?page=17,"Birds singing, a park with 1,000 planted trees and modern workplaces surrounded by an abundance of wood: this is the vision for “Arboretum”, the largest timber campus in Europe. Ten Liebherr EC-B series tower cranes are involved in the 650 million Euro project in Nanterre near Paris, France. The campus is designed to create a new connection between nature and the workplace and is sustainable thanks to its solid wood construction.Find out more",Press releases,12/01/2022,"Having as many as ten cranes on a construction site requires precise planning for efficient site operation. The top-slewing cranes, which will remain in operation until mid-2023, have to be coordinated with one another so that they don't interfere with each other's lifts. Just how flexible Liebherr’s EC-B series can be is on impressive display in Nanterre, where flat-top cranes with different hook heights, jib lengths and load capacities are required. “We opted for Liebherr cranes because of our longstanding business relationship,” says Antonio Silva de Almeida, the site manager in charge. “Liebherr cranes are ideal for carrying out this project because of their exceptional cost-effectiveness and safety standards.”Liebherr customer GCC has two 220 EC-B 10s, two 250 EC-B 10s, one 250 EC-B 12, two 285 EC-B 12s, two 340 EC-B 12s and one 370 EC-B 12 in operation. The jibs in use are between 47.5 and 60 metres in length. Hook heights range from 41 to 59 metres. As a result of these configurations and their flat-top design, the cranes can rotate above each other without encountering any problems. The transport and assembly-optimised cranes can, depending on the model, lift a maximum of ten or twelve tonnes. A 280 EC-H 12 high-top crane is additionally in use for the construction of the service centre.. Anti-collision system and crane operator lift To ensure optimal safety, all cranes are equipped with an anti-collision system from the French manufacturer AMCS technologies. The machines also include LiUP operator lifts, which particularly benefit crane operators and service engineers working at high hook heights, as is the case here. LiUP is designed to transport two people or a load of 200 kilograms. It gives crane operators quick access to their workplace and spares service engineers a strenuous climb during maintenance work.The “Arboretum” project on the banks of the Seine will provide 125,000 square metres of office and service space and will be mostly built of solid wood. The offices are set to be spread over five buildings and each of them will be named after a tree: Almond, Pine, Cedar, Fir and Spruce. A park, a fruit and vegetable garden for the use of campus restaurants, and two renovated industrial buildings will complete the area. The campus will offer ongoing contact with nature so that employees working there can relax and concentrate better. Measures designed to reduce the site’s carbon footprint include the reuse of materials, bioclimatic architecture and a geothermal system that will cover up to 80 percent of heating and cooling requirements.. Precise positioning with Micromove The construction of the new office buildings involves 20,000 cubic metres of wood from sustainably managed forests, as well as 55,000 cubic metres of concrete. All loads, some of which weigh several tonnes, have to be moved, and this is where the Liebherr tower cranes come in. “The cranes are reliable and powerful, and the LiUP lift ensures a high level of safety,” says site manager Antonio Silva de Almeida.The top-slewing cranes are being used for positioning timber and concrete elements such as posts, beams, columns, staircases and lifts. This work is supported by the Micromove fine positioning mode. The assistance system makes perfect use of Liebherr’s own high-performance drives so that loads are moved with precision over the course of several minutes and positioned with accuracy. This protects precast filigree concrete parts and existing constructions on site.. Comprehensive service for fast response timesMost of the cranes are new machines that GCC has secured under a leasing agreement. “Leasing means that customers always benefit from the latest cranes,” explains Sébastien Chalvet, Liebherr Key Account Manager for the Île-de-France region. Liebherr-Grues à Tour is responsible for overall fleet management, “Working this way ensures that cranes are perfectly maintained for maximum availability, and that we can guarantee our customers the highest possible safety standards.”The dense, worldwide service network of Tower Crane Customer Service enables the best possible service at our customers’ sites. Spare parts are quickly available thanks to decentralised logistics. Liebherr, for example, has an extensive spare parts warehouse in Fontenay-Trésigny, south-east of Paris.

Nine axles for Saudi Arabia: Bin Quraya adds an LTM 1750-9.1 to its crane fleet,News |11/30/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/nine-axles-for-saudi-arabia-bin-quraya-adds-an-ltm-1750-9-1-to-its-crane-fleet.html?page=18,Bin Quraya has strengthened its crane fleet with an LTM 1750-9.1 mobile crane. Liebherr handed over the symbolic key to the Saudi Arabian company at the Bauma stand in Munich.Find out more,News,11/30/2022,"Owner Awad Bin Quraya explains his company's investment in the new nine-axle mobile crane: ""We are seeing a growing demand in our market for cranes in this high load-capacity class. With its 800-tonne upgrade, the LTM 1750-9.1 can meet this demand very well. It is the most powerful crane in our fleet.""Bin Quraya plans to use the new LTM 1750-9.1 above all for maintenance work in the petrochemical industry. In this industry, the cranes' reliability and fast and reliable servicing by the manufacturer are hugely important. ""We are extremely satisfied with Liebherr. For many years we have had hardly any problems with the cranes and Liebherr has always provided rapid support as needed. This is of course very important for us, as we work directly with the oil company Saudi Aramco, for example,"" says Bin Quraya.Increase of the load capacity valuesTwo years ago Liebherr improved the LTM 1750-9.1's performance across almost its entire working range. The use of refined static calculation methods made it possible to increase the crane's lifting capacity. Due to its high load capacity and variable boom system, it can cover a wide range of jobs in industry, infrastructure and the energy sector. The all-terrain crane is designed to ensure particularly short set-up times and maximum mobility. Furthermore, this nine-axle mobile crane can carry its complete telescopic boom when driving on public roads. Extensive comfort and safety equipment, such as load charts for various wind speeds, round off the concept of the LTM 1750-9.1.About Bin QurayaBin Quraya is one of Saudi Arabia's largest engineering and project companies in the oil and gas industry. It was founded in the mid-1970s and today employs over 2,500 people. Its activities focus on work on oil platforms, laying pipelines, general construction work as well as major projects."

Alexander Rahlf, the second-generation head of the family business, explains: ""Apart from its enormous lifting capacity, the fact that the LTM 1160-5.2 is only 2.75 metres wide was a decisive factor in our decision. It is the only crane in its load class on the market with this width. This is a big advantage for us, because the roads in our rural region are often very narrow."". UK counterweight variant for FehrmarnRahlf opted for the ""UK counterweight variant"", which Liebherr initially developed for the special axle-load requirements in the UK. However, the entrepreneur also believes this has advantages for the company's standard driving condition with a 12-tonne axle load: ""The 3.5 tonne base plate can be carried on the crane. We can transport the remaining 50 tonnes of counterweight on two permit-free standard trucks. For many crane jobs, one truck is enough. This enables us to cover the previous 130-tonne range."". A new crane from Liebherr every year""We laid the foundation eight years ago with a Liebherr LTM 1070-4.2, with the – at the time – innovative VarioBase® Variable Supporting Base. Since then, we have bought one new Liebherr mobile crane each year. As all these cranes have a uniform operating concept, we can flexibly deploy our drivers on the different types,"" explains Rahlf. ""The sales and customer service at Liebherr is competent and reliable. Moreover, we feel in good hands at Liebherr, like part of a big family.""Rahlf-Krane is a traditional crane rental company that operates in the northern Schleswig-Holstein area – from boat loading to house building and commercial construction.

Using lava stones in cooling and freezing facilitates a quantum leap in energy efficiency,Press releases |11/29/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/using-lava-stones-in-cooling-and-freezing-facilitates-a-quantum-leap-in-energy-efficiency.html?page=18,"Liebherr-Hausgeräte GmbH is revolutionising technology in its fridges and freezers. Liebherr is the only manufacturer in the world to use a vacuum in conjunction with finely ground lava stone, the raw material perlite, to insulate its appliances. The first vacuum perlite models, named BluRoX, will be on the market as early as January 2023. For the very first time, it is possible to produce freezers with the energy efficiency class “A” and “B” in accordance with EU legislation thanks to the innovative technology.Find out more",Press releases,11/29/2022,"Until now, refrigerators and freezers have been insulated with conventional insulating materials made from petroleum-based polyurethane foam. Instead of these common foam elements, and in a world's first, BluRoX uses a vacuum in combination with finely ground perlite for insulation. Due to its crystalline microstructure, the lava stone perlite has a very low thermal conductivity, and the vacuum provides the best possible insulation in terms of energy. “For a family with a 350-litre freezer, the annual power consumption for the appliance could be reduced by up to 20 per cent”, explains Steffen Nagel, Managing Director Sales & Marketing at Liebherr-Hausgeräte GmbH. “This translates into notable savings with steadily rising electricity prices.”. The space-saving miracle: 25 per cent more space for food The new combination of a vacuum and finely ground lava stone enables a very compact design. Due to the particularly effective BluRoX insulation, Liebherr can design the walls of a BluRoX freezer to be about one third thinner than the walls of a conventional foam-insulated appliance. For an appliance fully equipped with vacuum perlite technology, the result is about 25 percent greater capacity compared to fridges and freezers with the same external dimensions.Lava stone: the altogether environmentally-friendly cooling wonderBluRoX equipment is not only manufactured in an environmentally friendly manner, but also proves to be a very eco-conscious choice at the end its service life. That is due to the fact that lava stone perlite can be easily removed and re-introduced into the manufacturing cycle and therefore re-used in new equipment without significant processing. The BluRoX insulation is not bonded to the surrounding components, so the outer shell and inner container can easily be re-processed and re-used.In addition, the lava stone perlite is a naturally renewable raw material. Only a small area is required for mining, which can then be restored to its natural state. Liebherr sources perlite from Europe and then processes it at its production site in Ochsenhausen and uses it in equipment with BluRoX technology.. Available from January 2023: a BluRoX hybrid applianceIn January 2023, Liebherr-Hausgeräte will launch the first freezer with BluRoX technology in the door. The walls of this FNb 5056 hybrid model are insulated with conventional foam insulation. As the first of its kind, this model will have efficiency class “B” in accordance with the new EU energy label. This will be followed over the next two years by the first BluRoX freezer fully equipped with vacuum perlite technology, which will be even more energy-efficient while offering the full space benefits this technology allows.Liebherr's world first is based on ten years of research and the company's patented technology. “With BluRoX, we are fulfilling the wish of a growing number of consumers who want to make their everyday lives more sustainable, save energy, and conserve resources,” states Steffen Nagel. “These new BluRoX freezers are extremely energy-efficient, recyclable, and retain the usual Liebherr ‘Made in Germany’ quality – they are going to be real customer magnets.”.

A Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 mobile crane is now available for the heaviest load cases of Fanger's customers. The new state-of-the-art mobile crane replaces an LTM 1500-8.1 that had been in use ""very reliably"" at the broad-based company for around 20 years.Find out more",Press releases,11/28/2022,"The brand new heavy-lifter from Fanger has been in use on Swiss construction sites for a few weeks now. The crane, painted silver-grey, had its baptism of fire during the construction of a new gymnasium in Sursee in the canton of Lucerne. Equipped with the T3 boom and 155 tonnes of counterweight, the new arrival was tasked with lifting several concrete trusses weighing almost 60 tonnes onto the building shell. This job was tailor-made for the powerful LTM 1650-8.1, which is packed with modern features, such as the freely adjustable distance of the slewing platform counterweight. Thanks to the option to set the counterweight radius to the minimum when taking on a load, it was possible to place the vehicle very close to the building, thus reducing the overhangs when installing the precast elements. Only when the elements were swivelled over the building was the radius hydraulically set to the maximum distance of 8.40 metres. This removed the need for twenty tonnes of counterweights, which therefore did not need to be transported to the construction site.Also ideal for use in mountain regions ""We simply wanted the most powerful mobile crane on eight axles,"" explains Stefan Fuchs, the responsible project manager at Fanger. ""With the new mobile crane, we can now realise projects that were not previously possible. Due to its compact design, the LTM 1650-8.1 is already a sensational machine. With the same dimensions as its predecessor, it delivers a significantly higher lifting capacity,"" says Fuchs. ""In addition, we can reduce its total weight to 53 tonnes for road travel if necessary."" With this crane, the telescopic boom and the front outriggers can be removed quickly and easily using quick-release fasteners and transported separately. ""This makes it even lighter than a normal 5-axle crane,"" explains Stefan Fuchs. ""This is crucial for us, because when driving in mountainous regions we often have limits in terms of the maximum weight of the vehicles. Also, all eight axles on the new crane are steerable.""With the acquisition of the heavy-duty LTM 1650-8.1, Fanger Kran AG, which operates a Liebherr LR 1750/2 crawler crane as well as a dozen mobile construction cranes, has strengthened its position in the crane business in Switzerland. ""In general, the loads are getting heavier and heavier,"" says Fuchs. ""The new crane came at exactly the right time for us. Following the job building the new gymnasium in Sursee, the mobile crane will be used frequently at the construction materials plant that also bears the customer's name. From the new machine's cab, crane driver Daniel Heiz described his first experiences with the new acquisition – albeit with typical Swiss brevity: ""Tip-top."".

Christoph Kleiner, Managing Director Sales at Liebherr's Ehingen plant, says: ""The energy transition is both a challenge and an opportunity. We are looking forward to setting the right course together with our customers and, in particular, to mastering future challenges alongside such a long-standing partner as Schmidbauer.”"
WAE and Liebherr pay tribute to their joint zero emissions work at Bauma 2022,News |11/17/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/wae-and-liebherr-pay-tribute-to-their-joint-zero-emissions-work-at-bauma-2022.html?page=18,Representatives from Williams Advanced Engineering (WAE) and Liebherr came together at Bauma 2022 to pay tribute to their work developing zero emission solutions for the mining sector.Find out more,News,11/17/2022,"The foundation for the relationship between WAE and Liebherr was laid in March 2022, when Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) acquired WAE as part of their journey to becoming an international renewable resource company. As part of FMG, WAE – an industry leader in the electrification and energy storage sectors – is working to support Fortescue Future Industries – FMG’s green energy enterprise – in its work in battery technology.In June 2022, FMG and Liebherr announced they were forming a partnership, with the intention of developing and supplying zero emission mining trucks as a step towards decarbonising the mining sector. Key to this partnership is Liebherr’s ability to work in conjunction with WAE and Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) to develop electric battery and fuel cell systems that will be integrated into Liebherr’s T 264 mining trucks. WAE’s extensive expertise in developing energy storage solutions for a wide range of sectors will be crucial in ensuring that this project becomes a success.Dave Rawlins, WAE’s Head of Engineering Technology said “We are delighted to be working on a strategic partnership with Liebherr to integrate zero emission drive systems into Liebherr products. This partnership will enable customers, including FMG, to move towards net zero emissions through delivery and management of drive solutions across the complete product lifecycle.”Bryant Ward, Managing Director, Liebherr Mining Equipment Newport News Co., also spoke about the partnership between WAE and Liebherr. “Working with the WAE team has been a fantastic experience. The teams between WAE and Liebherr work very well together and truly operate as one team. The partnership helps to rapidly expand our development capabilities and accelerate bringing products to market. Also, bringing the electrical energy specialists together with the truck specialists enables us to produce a high quality and high-performance product for the mining industry.”Liebherr’s partnership with both WAE and FMG became a key part of Liebherr’s Zero Emission Mining Program. Liebherr’s trolley trucks and electric mining excavators already provide low and zero emission solutions for customers. However, Liebherr is continuing to work within the Zero Emission Mining Program so that they can provide complete zero emission mining solutions for dozing, loading, and hauling – free of fossil fuels – by 2030.Liebherr is working with Tier 1 companies like WAE and FMG to meet its 2030 deadline and provide solutions that will lead the industry in both technological innovation and cost efficiency.. While at Bauma, Ward discussed Liebherr’s efforts in the zero emission space with customers and professionals within the mining industry. “The response from customers at Bauma was tremendously positive. I personally received several comments from customers and industry peers that Liebherr has an advanced and clear strategy for moving forward with zero emission mining products.”Supply of the zero emission mining trucks being developed by Liebherr, WAE, and FFI is expected to commence after the conclusion of a two-year joint development period between the three companies. There is already significant interest from other mining companies in the solutions that FFI, WAE, and Liebherr are developing. Once the initial field deliveries of the zero emission T 264 trucks have been made to FMG, it is intended to offer these products to more customers."

Three 172 EC-B 8s, two 125 Ks, one 81 K.1 and one 120 K.1 are in operation on the site, which covers around 13 hectares.Find out more",News,11/17/2022,"The new build consists of five four-storey office buildings, several of which have an integrated atrium. These inner courtyards are designed to provide as many rooms as possible with natural light. It is here that the 125 K fast-erecting cranes are positioned, something which is made possible by their exceptional flexibility. The jib can, for example, be unfolded and disassembled off-ground, allowing the machines to be positioned in tight spaces. On top of that, the 125 K cranes offer ten different intermediate hook heights so that they can be individually adapted to the height of the building in question.. Coordinated hook heights “Their extensive flexibility in terms of height adjustment and lifting capacity make these machines an ideal match for our construction site,” says site manager Bernd Keuter from construction contractor Schulte. Site supervisor Christian Diekhaus (also from Schulte) agrees and is particularly impressed by the cranes’ driving performance, “The control system and drives make crane travel really smooth and safe.”Liebherr dealer MARM Baumaschinen has provided the 172 EC-Bs and the 120 K.1 on hire. The 125 K and 81 K.1 cranes were purchased by Schulte. MARM is on hand with a service team for skilled maintenance and was involved in operational planning. Liebherr's Tower Crane Solutions project department also assisted with project planning. “The support provided by MARM and Liebherr was outstanding, right from project planning through to implementation,” says Bernd Keuter, the responsible site manager at Schulte.The 125 K cranes are working with 34.3 and 41.5 metre hook heights and jibs measuring 50 metres. The 81 K.1 has a hook height of 17.9 metres and a 45-metre radius, the 120 K.1 is in use with a hook height of 25.6 metres and a radius of 50 metres. The 172 EC-B 8 cranes have hook heights of 25.5 metres, 33 metres and 40.5 metres; their jibs measure 50 metres. Thanks to their different hook heights, all the construction cranes are able to slew smoothly over each other without causing any obstructions.. Energy-saving construction More than 2,000 employees will be based in the building, which covers an area of 55,000 square metres. Alongside 21,000 square metres of office space, there are also plans for a training and seminar area as well as for meeting and event rooms. Outbuildings and a multi-storey car park are also in the works. A photovoltaic system will be installed on the roof of the multi-storey car park with the aim of reducing the company’s carbon footprint. Plus, the entire building will be compliant with the German KfW Energy Efficiency Standard 55 thanks to its energy-saving construction. Edeka Minden-Hannover has said that it is investing around 150 million euros in the future-oriented headquarters. The Edeka campus is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2024."

The LHM 600 will be based on the updated generation of Liebherr mobile harbour cranes. Digital enhancements, a modernised cabin, and improved lifting height are among the crane’s benefits welcomed by Port Canaveral.Find out more",Press releases,11/15/2022,"The second LHM 600 purchased by Port Canaveral is built for the future. It boasts a contemporary exterior design and is more digitally advanced and efficient. Assistance and partial automation systems are made possible by a sophisticated crane control system, evolved sensor integration, and digital information transfer. It will be Port Canaveral’s second mobile harbour crane to be deployed. In early 2019, the Port put into service its first Liebherr mobile harbour crane of type LHM 600.The forthcoming crane will have a lift capability up to 154 tons and a jib length of 61 meters. Its 20-container reach will accommodate containers stacked nine high on deck – an upgraded handling capability from the first crane.. Pioneering crane will support growing cargo business, offer more featuresPort Canaveral is already familiar with Liebherr mobile harbour cranes. The LHM 600 that started its work in early 2019 has been instrumental in heavy-lifting operations for the Port. In Fiscal Year 2020, the current LHM 600 already lifted a record number of boosters for space projects. With the upcoming LHM 600, the outreach ability has been upgraded from 58 to 61 meters.“We’re pleased to add this major acquisition to our port to better meet the demands of an expanding portfolio of diverse cargo,” notes Port CEO Captain John Murray. “We’re projecting the pace of growth in cargo handling to be very significant over the coming year.

Port of Arendal adds LHM 550 with E-Drive,Press releases |11/08/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/port-of-arendal-adds-lhm-550-with-e-drive.html?page=19,"Located in the southern part of Norway between Larvik and Kristiansand, the Port of Arendal is the biggest bulk port in Norway that uses mobile harbour cranes. The new LHM 550 joining the port is equipped for a variety of cargo applications. Liebherr’s own SmartGrip assistance system will optimise bulk handling for a battery factory in the region.Find out more",Press releases,11/08/2022,"In August 2022, Liebherr delivered a new LHM 550 to the Port of Arendal in Norway. The main commercial terminal for the port is located at Eydehavn, just outside the city of Arendal. Eydehavn is a harbour that offers cranes and handling equipment for bulk loads, project cargo, offshore equipment, and containers. With a lifting capacity of up to 144 tonnes, this LHM 550 offers the port the ability to support larger project and special cargo, as well as optimised bulk operations. Another distinguishing benefit sought by the Port of Arendal is Liebherr’s extensive and high standard of service. Besides remote technical support and local field service, a large selection of original parts will help keep the LHM 550 running over many years.Options for improved bulk processing, handling larger cargo, and supporting more customersThe four-rope version of the LHM 550 that was delivered to the client in Arendal will provide flexible applications for cargo and material lifting. For increased efficiency in handling bulk cargo, a suitable grab that is coupled with Liebherr’s SmartGrip technology was part of the crane’s delivery. This feature can optimise the filling rate of the grab in a self-learning manner. In this way, SmartGrip learns after just a few lifting cycles how to optimise capacity utilisation of the grab. This reduces overloads to a minimum, increases the material handling rate and, at the same time, alleviates crane operator stress. Bulk material such as salt and sulphur will be among the main resources that will be handled by the LHM 550. A forthcoming project in the area that will benefit from the crane’s optimisations is a new battery factory by Morrow Batteries.Rune Hvass, Port Director at Arendal Havn, notes: “After deliberations about which LHM model fits our logistical needs the best, we ultimately decided on the LHM 550. An increasing number of customers are demanding capacity for larger and heavier project and general cargo. To also provide better support for a new battery factory that will be built locally, the choice for a larger mobile harbour crane made most sense.” Rune Hvass continues: “The high-quality level at which Liebherr is building its cranes, and especially the service concept Liebherr provides, were some of the main reasons why we decided to purchase a Liebherr mobile harbour crane.”To help reduce noise, the crane is equipped with noise insulation material in the winch and machinery compartment. The crane is also equipped with an e-drive to enable local CO2-emission-free operation. In addition, the complete LiDAT smartApp package was chosen for the LHM 550. The LiDAT modules such as Maintenance and Optimise help monitor a variety of variables for better performance tracking and efficiency of the crane.. Crane’s arrival is welcome news for clients and communityThe Port of Arendal now has a new, well-calibrated machine to effectively support their clients’ growing logistical demands. With a radius of 54 metres, the LHM 550 is the perfect crane for handling bulk cargoes in the Capesize ship class. Container handling ships of the New-Panamax class are also part of the crane’s forte. General cargoes and heavy-duty lifting up to 144 tonnes complete the range of applications of the LHM 550.To help mark the delivery of the crane, a special naming contest was hosted by the port. Arendal Havn invited 25 groups featuring the region’s kindergartens, primary schools and lower secondary schools to participate in a naming contest for the port’s new giant. The winner of the contest was Trollstubben kindergarten with the group Fjelltroll and Vetter. They received a prize of NOK 2,000, which equates to around 200 EUR, and a tour of the harbour. The LHM 550 was named “Hulken,” or “Hulk” in English, and is based on the Marvel comic book character.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Bigge’s Perfect Fleet is growing bigger with new Liebherr models!,Press releases |10/27/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/bigge%E2%80%99s-perfect-fleet-is-growing-bigger-with-new-liebherr-models!.html?page=22,"For Liebherr’s long-standing customer, Bigge Crane and Rigging Co., it is crucial to provide the right crane for the right market at the right cost. On the first day of Bauma 2022, Liebherr has handed over new crawler cranes to the company - an LR 1400 SX and an LR 1700-1.0. These new models are on top of Bigge’s Perfect Fleet®, including over a hundred crawler and mobile cranes from Liebherr.Find out more",Press releases,10/27/2022,"Based in California and Texas, Bigge is one of the biggest crane rental companies in the USA. “Big” is also the keyword for the machine that was the first to be handed over at the Liebherr booth at this year’s Bauma. The LR 1400 SX is the largest multipurpose crawler crane that Liebherr has ever built. It was developed because Liebherr listened to its customers. “Just build a bigger LR 1300,” said one customer. The LR 1300 SX is the best-selling crawler crane to date. Over fifteen years ago, Bigge started to use their first 300-tonne crawler cranes for lifting activities. To date, they have purchased more than 130 models of the LR 1300 SX.But the loads that need to be moved are getting heavier and heavier, and this changes the demands on the cranes. The new LR 1400 SX results from the customers’ needs – powerful, fast, and easy to operate. The crawler crane has a load capacity of 400 tonnes.Bigge emphasized at the handover that the LR 1400 SX on display at the Bauma is one of many more models they are planning to add to their fleet. The company has already ordered three more units. This purchase represents Bigge’s significant commitment to offering a Perfect Fleet to customers and partners everywhere, providing the right crane for the right market at the right cost.Despite its size, the LR 1400 SX is easy to transport and assemble. The heaviest part of transport is the uppercarriage. It includes the carbody center section and the A-frame – parts that never need to be disassembled. Even the walkways and railings can easily be folded up and remain on the crane for transport.Thanks to the crane’s self-assembly system, it is easy to assemble and disassemble the hoist winches, crawlers, carbody counterweight, and boom sections – all of this without a service crane. The crane can even lift, lower, and secure the 150-tonne rear counterweight hydraulically. The rear counterweight itself is modular and can be equipped with five or 10-tonne counterweight slabs, depending on the requirements.The LR 1400 SX is equipped with a powerful 450 kW Liebherr diesel engine – the most powerful engine in its class! The crawlers are now equipped with four drive motors, making it easier to manoeuvre on construction sites with difficult ground conditions.Third LR 1700-1.0 on orderBigge already operates two LR 1700-1.0 crawler cranes in its fleet and has ordered a third crane for delivery in 2023. It is intended for use in industry and wind power. Bigge will then operate the largest fleet of this type of crane in the USA.The LR 1700-1.0 combines the benefits of economical transport of 600 tonne (660 US-ton) class crawler cranes with the performance of 750 tonne (825 US-ton) class lattice boom cranes. Also, it features all the innovations of Liebherr’s crawler crane developments from the last few years.The LR 1700-1.0 is actually the benchmark in this crane class for lattice boom cranes both for classic industry work and also for wind power. The boom can be raised to a height of up to 198 metres, comprising the main boom at 102 metres and a luffing jib at 96 metres. These lattice sections enable the crane to be used in purely main boom mode with a length of up to 162 metres.Minimal wear is becoming more and more important for moving the crawler travel gear, particularly during jobs at wind farms. The Liebherr engineers have therefore made the structural steelwork for the crawler carriers particularly robust and increased the size of the rollers. The 4-fold drive for the travel gear is standard.Bigge also operates the largest fleet of LR 1500s in the US. Two more LR 1500s are on order for delivery in 2023. For the first of these, Bigge has ordered equipment for wind power and industrial applications.Bigge has also ordered two LTM 1230-5.1s from Liebherr.The Liebherr staff are delighted with the orders from its long-standing customer – also because many industry insiders consider an order from Bigge as a seal of quality. The crane rental company advertises to offer its customers the Perfect Fleet with the best cranes in their class.The animation shows the LR 1400 SX from its transportation to the jobsite to the execution of lifting work: Liebherr Crawler Crane LR 1400 SX.

However, Karunia has been operating one unit of the R 9300 since September of this year. Throughout the operation of this excavator, Karunia has been providing Liebherr with valuable insight into the overall performance of the R 9300 as well as the functionality of the new, more advanced, Liebherr Mining technologies fitted into the machine. These new technologies provide increased operational efficiency, reduced fuel consumption and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, and higher levels of operator safety and comfort.The R 9300 is currently being used to remove and load overburden on site and to load coal into 100 tonne mining trucks. This new excavator is capable of filling trucks of this size in a total of four passes. “The performance of the R 9300 surpasses our expectations by far. All the newly installed features have definitely supported us in achieving continuous and peak productivity targets!” stated Nahdi Asfahani, Karunia’s Director of Plant and Supply Chain.Karunia is a mining contractor headquartered in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan. Karunia was established in 1993 and started its operations by offering construction services and the supply and rental of heavy equipment. As part of these core activities, Karunia has carried out several infrastructure projects around the mining concessions of PT Bayan Resources Tbk (Bayan). In 2011, Karunia was given the opportunity to expand its services within the mining business when Bayan offered an initial contract for the Tabang mine.Liebherr cemented its own relationship with Karunia in late 2021, with the handing over of an R 9100 mining excavator at the Tabang mine site in East Borneo, Indonesia.Christian Bombenger, the Managing Director of Liebherr Indonesia, said of the partnership, “We appreciate the tremendous level of trust and transparency that has prevailed in our relationship from the get-go. Our companies communicate incredibly well at all levels and we always find innovative solutions to further improve our partnership over time.”Karunia has expressed its great satisfaction with the performance of other Liebherr products already in operation on site. These products include the R 9100 and R 9200 mining excavators and the PR 776 mining dozers. In fact, as a result of the performance of these machines, Karunia has purchased additional units of these models, bringing the total number of units in its Liebherr fleet to 22.“We have experienced high levels of professionalism, commitment, excellent communication and effectiveness with Liebherr Indonesia. These values are clearly what we also see as essential for a lasting relationship,” commented Achmad Asfia, President Director & Owner of Karunia. The recent partnership between Liebherr Indonesia and Karunia also represents new opportunities for Liebherr Mining as a whole. “This new partnership allows us to once again demonstrate both the consistency we are known for in the market, but also to deliver superb and promising new perspectives for our future sustainable growth in Indonesia,” said Max Muench, General Manager of Sales & Marketing for Liebherr Indonesia.The R 9300 mining excavator is still currently within the validation stage but will enter serial production in 2024."

Liebherr unveils fleet data management for mobile and crawler cranes,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-unveils-fleet-data-management-for-mobile-and-crawler-cranes.html?page=23,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr will unveil a fleet data management solution for its mobile and crawler cranes. In addition to the machine's location, the system displays a range of additional real-time data, such as the fuel consumption, the current wind speed, the weight of the load on the hook and even when the crane's next service is due. Customers can also use the system to generate custom reports for specially defined construction sites, such as the fuel consumption or CO2 emissions.Find out more",Press releases,10/24/2022,"The new Liebherr solution is an easy introduction to the world of telemetry, a technology that is already widespread in modern cars, dishwashers and even robotic lawnmowers. It allows the user of the corresponding device to monitor its operating parameters from anywhere in the world. While this is more of a gimmick for domestic appliances, remote telemetry generates significant benefits for customers with mobile and crawler cranes. The Liebherr fleet data management solution enables customers to also monitor in real time – from the office or while on the road – the current location of specific machines, to determine whether the current prevailing wind force allows safe working, and even to see the weight of the load currently hanging from the hook. The remaining quantity and consumption of fuel and AdBlue are also displayed – if the level falls below certain limits, the system informs the user.Fast job site reports - thanks to geofencing and MyLiebherrThe user can define an area on a map, such as a construction site. Whenever the crane moves within this area, all data is assigned to it (geofencing). By selecting a construction site and a time period, the user can then analyse (for example) the number of operating hours for a particular crane at the selected site within the defined period, how much fuel it has consumed, and can even see the quantity of CO2 emissions generated by the crane. This data forms the basis for the billing process and the creation of certain reports, which crane operators are increasingly required to send to their customers. Liebherr Product Manager Wolfgang Boos explains: ""It is important to us not to display arbitrary data just because a corresponding sensor is installed. We want to provide the customer with data that helps them manage their machine fleet and thus operate it as economically as possible.""The right solution for almost every craneStarting in 2023, a future-proof modem will be gradually installed in the various new crane types as standard. For Liebherr, the fleet data management system launched at Bauma is just the beginning of a whole series of further planned digital services. If a customer's crane is already in the field, Liebherr offers retrofit solutions – even for models produced up to ten years ago. Modern cranes generate more data than older models, which generally have fewer sensors installed – Liebherr's customer service team is on hand to inform the customer exactly what kind of data can be expected from the crane in question.Regardless of whether a series modem or a retrofit solution is installed, a modem requires a mobile phone SIM card with a data plan to send the data to the client application. To ensure that customers can enter this new data-driven world without any hurdles, all Liebherr modems for Liebherr cranes are equipped with a data SIM card for which Liebherr covers the costs – regardless of the country in which the crane is operated. Therefore, Liebherr customers need not worry about expensive roaming charges.Your fleet – your dataThe entire system is based on the proven ""MyLiebherr"" customer portal. Having registered their cranes in the portal, customers can then (for example) download operating instructions or order spare parts. The portal also opens up the world of crane data. ""MyLiebherr"" has been thoroughly modernised – on the start page, customers can already clearly see the machines in their fleet and navigate directly to the desired model. The new system is currently being tested with selected customers and will be rolled out successively to all operators from the beginning of 2023.By choosing the ""Performance"" application, as the service is called, the customer receives a fleet data management system in the form of an all-round carefree package. This is the customer's opportunity to use their machines even more efficiently and thus to operate them more economically. The new package is also further proof that Liebherr's customers not only get outstanding cranes, but also have access to a constantly growing portfolio of services and offers to help ensure optimised use of their crane fleet..

The master of all roads: New Liebherr LTM 1100-5.3 mobile crane ,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-master-of-all-roads-new-liebherr-ltm-1100-5-3-mobile-crane.html?page=23,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr will present a mobile crane that takes the combination of mobility, economy and performance to a new level. The LTM 1100-5.3 offers a powerful 62-metre telescopic boom and carries up to 16.9 tonnes of ballast with a 12-tonne axle load on public roads. TFind out more",Press releases,10/24/2022,"In the All-Terrain Cranes section of the Liebherr stand at Bauma, two mobile cranes visibly stand out. They both feature a new driver's cabin and crane cab, new paintwork and the LICCON3 control system – the previously unveiled LTM 1110-5.2 and the all-new LTM 1100-5.3.When designing the LTM 1100-5.3, Liebherr focused above all on lightweight construction to allow as much ballast as possible to be carried with a 12-tonne axle load; and to achieve the lowest possible axle loads by reducing ballast. In addition, the new crane was designed with a long, strong telescopic boom in mind.High mobility, worldwideEven in countries where mobile cranes with a 12-tonne axle load are permitted on the roads, crane operators have been demanding cranes which can be driven with low axle loads and total weights by simply removing the ballast. These models deliver major benefits when it comes to obtaining licences and route permits. In addition, day-to-day circumstances often require reduced weights, such as when driving over bridges and in inner cities.When it comes to flexible axle loads, the new LTM 1100-5.3 sets unprecedented standards. With 0.8 tonnes of ballast, it reaches a total weight of 44 tonnes with axle loads of 9 tonnes. With 4.4 tonnes of ballast, it can travel with 10 tonnes of axle load and a total weight of 48 tonnes. With an axle load of 12 tonnes, the new 100-tonne crane can carry up to 16.9 tonnes of counterweights. At 75 per cent of the maximum ballast of 22.5 tonnes, this is a new record for mobile cranes worldwide. This allows the new LTM 1100-5.3 to perform the majority of its jobs as a taxi crane without additional ballast transport. Even with maximum ballast, the axle loads of 13.4 tonnes are low and evenly distributed across all axles. The new LTM 1100-5.3 has a narrow width of 2.55 metres – an additional advantage when driving on roads and construction sites. It is the first 5-axle mobile crane worldwide based on this narrow design.Large working range with the 62-metre telescopic boomAt 62 metres, the telescopic boom is two metres longer than the next most powerful Liebherr 5-axle machine, the LTM 1110-5.2. In addition, a 9.5 to 16-metre folding jib is available which, as an option, can also be adjusted hydraulically between 0° and 40°. This enables the LTM 1100-5.3 to achieve hoisting heights of up to 76 metres and radii of up to 64 metres. Other options include a 2-metre assembly jib and a side-folding rooster sheave, which offer additional flexibility in use.The new 100-tonne crane offers extra safety, flexibility and lifting capacity thanks to the VarioBase® variable outrigger. Greater flexibility on the construction site is also provided by the standard VarioBallast®, which allows the ballast radius to be adjusted between 4.0 and 5.1 metres.LICCON3 crane control systemThe third generation of the LICCON (Liebherr Computed Control) system relies on proven control features, but also includes a completely new software package and programming language as well as a faster databus, significantly more storage space and more computing power. Crane operators who are familiar with the previous control system will quickly and easily get to grips with the new version, as the recognition value is very high. Proven hardware components, such as the mobile operating and display unit BTT, have been adopted. The touchscreen function on the new large display in the superstructure cab means that it is now even easier and more comfortable to control. The way in which the information is shown has also been revised and simplified. In addition, LICCON3 cranes are prepared for telemetry and fleet management as standard. In the future, crane contractors will be able to view and evaluate all the relevant data using the MyLiebherr customer portal.New driver's cabin and crane cabAs a result of the high synergy effects involved, Liebherr is launching the new driver's cabin at the same time as the LICCON3 control system. The modern design features premium materials and timeless lines as well as delivering a whole host of improvements for the crane driver. These include the new multifunction steering wheel, side roller blind on the driver’s door, improved instruments and modules as well as new displays. Additional convenience is offered by options such as a central locking system with remote key and the ""Coming and Leaving Home"" function.A completely new, modern automatic heating and air-conditioning system in the driver's cabin and in the crane cab, which features an adapted design, ensures a high level of comfort. A sun sensor detects strong sunshine and automatically adjusts the heating settings.The lighting packages for the crane cab, the superstructure, the rear of the vehicle, the front headlights and the telescopic boom as well as the lattice fly jib have been optimised and can be operated with LEDs. The benefits of LED technology include a longer service life and superior lighting performance.ZF TraXon DynamicPerform gear unitThe innovative DynamicPerform coupling module is installed in the new LTM 1100-5.3. It ensures virtually wear-free starting and manoeuvring without overheating for the modular ZF TraXon gear unit, because it transmits the engine output via an oil-cooled clutch plate pack. The friction heat generated when starting is dissipated in the clutch oil and supplied to the vehicle’s cooling system via an oil/water heat exchanger. Crane operators thus benefit from greater efficiency and lower maintenance costs.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The toughest in the roughest: Liebherr expands its rough-terrain crane range with the LRT 1130-2.1,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-toughest-in-the-roughest-liebherr-expands-its-rough-terrain-crane-range-with-the-lrt-1130-2-1.html?page=24,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr will showcase the most powerful rough-terrain crane on two axles on the market. The LRT 1130-2.1 has a maximum lifting capacity of 130 tonnes and extends Liebherr’s range of rough-terrain cranes at the top end of this segment.Find out more",Press releases,10/24/2022,"Liebherr will unveil a 130-tonne rough-terrain crane at Bauma 2022 under the slogan ""The toughest in the roughest"". The new LRT 1130-2.1 offers very high lifting capacities and the longest telescopic boom of any 2-axle rough-terrain crane anywhere in the world. It also has the most economical transport dimensions in its performance class.High performance with long telescopic boomThe concept of the LRT 1130-2.1 is maximum performance with economical mobility, worldwide. The new Liebherr rough-terrain crane is currently the only 130-tonne crane on a 2-axle chassis. At the same time, its telescopic boom is the longest in its class at 60 metres. It consists of the pivot section and six telescopic sections and is extended and bolted fully automatically with the Liebherr TELEMATIK high-speed telescopic system.A 10.8 metre single folding jib or a 10.8 - 19 metre double folding jib is available for the LRT 1130-2.1. It is mounted at angles of 0°, 20° or 40°, or can optionally be hydraulically tilted from 0° to 40°. With an additional seven-metre lattice section as a telescopic extension, the new crane reaches hook heights of up to 85 metres. The folding jib is carried on the right-hand side of the boom. At the same time, a 2.9-metre assembly jib can be attached to the left-hand side of the boom. A side-folding rooster sheave, which can be operated in 2-line mode, rounds off the boom options.Economical transportLiebherr has designed the dimensions of the new LRT 1130-2.1 so that it can be transported economically on low-loaders worldwide. Its width is 3.4 metres, its height 3.85 metres and its chassis length is 9.4 metres. The transport weight is 48 tonnes without ballast, but with the folding jib and hook block. This can be reduced to 44.8 tonnes. These values are unique in the class of powerful 2-axle all-terrain cranes. A permit-free standard transport vehicle is sufficient for the 20-tonne ballast and additional equipment. The counterweight consists of three ballast slabs and is attached to the slewing platform via self-assembly with ballasting rams.""Safety first"" – safety equipment sets new standardsHigh safety levels in every respect were the main priority for the design of the new LRT 1130-2.1, which features an outrigger monitoring system as standard. The outrigger status, on tyres or supports, is detected automatically and saved to the crane controller. The attachment of the ballast to the slewing platform and the installation of the optional double folding jib, including its angle adjustment system, are also recorded and monitored.The VarioBase® variable support base, which was developed by Liebherr and is standard equipment on all Liebherr LRT cranes, makes an important contribution to increasing safety. VarioBase® allows each individual crane outrigger to be extended to any length. The crane work is controlled by the load moment limiter within the LICCON controller, which calculates the maximum load capacities precisely for the current situation. This prevents accidents caused by human error during the assembly process and when hoisting loads. VarioBase® also offers greater flexibility on the construction site, higher lifting capacities and a larger working range. The greatest advantages are achieved in the areas directly above the outriggers.Safety is also enhanced by providing greater comfort for the operating personnel. The new 130-tonne crane also features the wide crane cab that has already proven its worth on the other Liebherr LRT models. It can be tilted backwards to provide greater comfort when hoisting loads to great heights. Clear, self-explanatory controls make the crane easy to handle. They allow crane drivers to concentrate on the main focus of their job, working with the crane and the load. Liebherr calls this concept KISS: ""keep it simple and safe"".There are ladders, a large number of handles and an electrically extending platform on the cabin to ensure safe access to the crane. The new LRT crane features a wide range of storage boxes for extensive accessories, lifting tackle and support timbers as standard. There is also storage for the load hook.Like the LRT 1090-2.1 and LRT 1100-2.1 cranes, the LRT 1130-2.1 also complies with a global, uniform safety standard and thus with globally valid regulations such as the US ASME B30.5 standard, the European EN 13000 standard, the Australian Standards (AS) and the Russian GOST standard. The machines also include systems to prevent safety equipment being bypassed. Liebherr is a pioneer in the industry in this respect.High off-road capability The new LRT 1130-2.1 is designed for robustness, off-road mobility and manoeuvrability. It is powered by a 6-cylinder CUMMINS combustion engine that complies with all applicable exhaust emission regulations. It can be operated without restrictions with hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO). The engine develops 188 kW (252 bhp) and supplies a maximum torque of 1,186 Nm. A 6-speed powershift transmission from DANA and large 29.5 R 25 tyres guarantee the required off-road capability. All-wheel and crab steering ensure easy handling and high manoeuvrability in constricted conditions.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The new 70 to 100 tonne crawler excavators from Liebherr,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-new-70-to-100-tonne-crawler-excavators-from-liebherr.html?page=24,"As part of the revision of the model range, the Liebherr crawler excavators of the 5.2 and 6.2 generations weighing between 70 and 100 tonnes will be presented to the public for the first time at Bauma 2022 in Munich.Find out more",Press releases,10/24/2022,"The new Liebherr crawler excavators R 972, R 978 SME, R 992 and R 998 SME replace the R 966, R 970 SME, R 976 and R 980 SME models. The new designation is directly related to the operating weight of the machines. A modernisation of the design language accompanies the renaming and underlines the relationship to the upcoming Generation 8 crawler excavators.Lower fuel consumption and thus fewer emissionsThe new crawler excavators were developed at Liebherr's long-standing site in Colmar (France) with the aim of significantly reducing overall energy consumption. The new, patented Liebherr Power Efficiency (PE) - Engine Control system in particular contributed to this.In concrete terms, the new ""PE"" function is represented by a work mode that complements the existing modes of the crawler excavator (P+/P/E). This significant innovation allows a 10-15% reduction in fuel consumption compared to previous models.. Machine automation: Liebherr's Bucket Fill Assist systemThe new excavator model range is available with the Bucket Fill Assist function. This assistance system has an ""anti-stalling"" mode that prevents the bucket jamming when penetrating digging material. In this way, this option provides the operator with additional support when using the machine and ensures higher productivity and more comfort. The assist function also enables semi-automatic bucket filling, providing an automated and faster cycle through easier bucket filling, higher bucket filling level and better penetration into the digging material. In addition to reducing fuel consumption by 10 %, the Liebherr Bucket Fill Assist system also reduces vibrations that would otherwise occur during operation, improving operator comfort. The resulting reduced wear on the bucket also helps to reduce operating costs.New operating modes for individual work needsAll Liebherr hydraulic crawler excavators in the G5.2 and G6.2 model series are equipped with the Modetronic function, which proved its worth in Generation 8. This further development allows the operator to adapt the hydraulic characteristics of their excavator to the respective application and to their individual habits.The Modetronic control system thus offers even more comfort and productivity by assisting the machine operator when driving as well as during rotary motion and facilitating control of the boom, stick and bucket. In addition, the Modetronic function enables a more dynamic behaviour of the machine in ""Dynamic"" mode and increased machine stability in ""Efficient"" mode. The ""Custom"" mode supplements the working modes with the facility to perform precision work with greater ease. In ""Fine"" mode, the machine operator can use the display to make individual adjustments to the machine movements to suit their own preferences.. For even more demanding work: Higher performance and more comfortThe new G5.2 and G6.2 generation excavators presented at Bauma 2022 incorporate the further developments in the cab area known from the excavator generation 8. The main screen grows from seven to nine inches and the new hand and foot control units ensure more precise machine movements.To ensure that all hydraulic crawler excavators meet customers' needs in the best possible way, improvements have been made to each model that are both innovative and performance-enhancing. A continuous chain guide is available as an option on all new excavator models in the range. In addition, the machines benefit from increased engine power. The R 998 SME with an operating weight of more than 100 tonnes gets a new chassis with larger dimensions with a track of 3900 mm and a wheelbase of 5000 mm. The model thus gains stability and as a result is ideally suited for demanding working environments, such as quarrying and mining.At the Liebherr stand, the R 992 model will be presented with a 7.20 m gooseneck boom and a 2.90 m stick. The R 992, which replaces the R 976, guarantees 5% more engine power. The crawler excavator, which weighs more than 94 tonnes, is powered by a powerful diesel engine with 420 kW / 544 hp. It is equipped with an LC-V chassis, a counterweight of 16 tonnes and a 600 mm track pad.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr shows first luffing jib crane with fibre rope technology at Bauma 2022 ,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-shows-first-luffing-jib-crane-with-fibre-rope-technology-at-bauma-2022.html?page=24,A newcomer to Liebherr's HC-L series: the 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre is the first luffing jib crane with high-tensile fibre rope design. Liebherr is showcasing the heavy-duty crane in public for the first time at the construction machinery trade fair in Munich.Find out more,Press releases,10/24/2022,"The 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre achieves comparable hook heights to the 230 HC-L 8/16 steel rope model. At a maximum jib length of approx. 60 metres, the jib head load capacity is still as much as 2,500 kilograms. The 230 HC-L 8/16 manages up to 1,900 kilograms at the jib head. Liebherr has also increased the maximum lifting capacity of the 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre by 25 percent to 10 tonnes in 1-line operation, which meets today’s market demands for this size class. As well as the proven 355 IC tower system for climbing inside buildings, there is also the option of using the 24 HC tower system, starting with the 24 HC 420, which offers efficient assembly with only one taper pin connection per corner post.. Less weight, more powerThe crane’s impressive performance is largely due to its use of fibre rope, which is significantly lighter than steel rope of a comparable diameter. The fibre rope ensures that a similar crane design is able to offer greater load capacities and a faster working speed. “When using our Fibre cranes, the greater the hook height is, the more substantial the possible increases in load capacity are,” says Markus Kinateder, Product Manager, Liebherr-Werk Biberach GmbH. Reduced wear of materials and exceptional durability contribute to the machine’s particularly long service life and, therefore, its cost-efficiency.The HC-L series luffing jib cranes are in a league of their own when it comes to particularly high hook heights, which can be achieved with virtually no restrictions thanks to various climbing and rigging systems. Their compact slewing radius and adjustable jib allow them to be used where only limited space is available. Small out-of-service radii ensure that free slewing isn't a problem, even if there are multiple cranes on site or buildings with projecting edges. Intelligent assistance systems ensure efficient and safe crane operation. Level luffing at the touch of a button and the fine positioning mode Micromove enable crane operators to work with precision.. Fibre rope advantages at a glanceThe high-tensile fibre rope, which is the result of 10 years of development work by Liebherr and the rope manufacturer Teufelberger, is a groundbreaking technology. Fibre cranes achieve significantly higher performance values compared to their steel rope counterparts. The fibre rope is more durable, easier to handle when reeving due to its lighter weight, and maintenance is less complicated as lubrication isn’t required. And on top of all that, operational safety is also increased; crane operators are able to see at a glance when the fibre rope needs replacing. The components of the rope’s cover wear out at different rates – a red layer indicates that the rope has reached the end of its service life..

Bauma 2022: New Liebherr 520 EC-B crane with fibre rope,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/bauma-2022-new-liebherr-520-ec-b-crane-with-fibre-rope.html?page=24,The largest addition to the “Tough Guys” series: Liebherr is expanding its EC-B series upwards with the 520 EC-B 20 Fibre. The new flat-top crane with fibre rope and a lifting capacity of up to 20 tonnes is on show for the first time at the construction machinery trade fair in Munich.Find out more,Press releases,10/24/2022,"With a maximum jib length of 83 metres, the 520 EC-B 20 Fibre is capable of lifting as much as 2,900 kilograms at the jib head and comes equipped with a connection for the 24 HC 420 and 24 HC 630 tower systems. A freestanding hook height of up to approx. 96 metres is also possible. The jib can be flexibly adjusted in 2.5-metre increments depending on site requirements. “We have had so many positive results with our EC-B series since introducing our fibre rope technology. We’re really happy to be expanding the EC-B series upwards with the help of a new rope diameter,“ says Markus Kinateder, Product Manager, Liebherr-Werk Biberach GmbH. The fibre rope for the 520 EC-B 20 Fibre measures 25 millimetres in diameter (already available versions measure 20 and 22 millimetres).. Clever assembly conceptThe development process focused on assembly and transport as well as performance in order to meet all the demands faced by a modern crane fleet. A clever assembly concept, including quick assembly connections and a compact head, makes the crane easy to set up. Only five transport units are needed to deliver the slewing section and jib, including counter-ballast, to the site in question. This saves both time and costs and also helps to reduce emissions. Liebherr is therefore able to offer its customers a high-quality crane that operates safely, efficiently and in an environmentally responsible way.EC-B series cranes particularly prove their worth on construction sites where multiple machines are in use at the same time. Their flat-top design enables them to turn above each other without encountering problems, which ensures safe working. The climbable cranes with ergonomic LiCAB cabin, feature intelligent assistance systems that support the crane operator according to the requirements of the job at hand. New to the market as of this year are the 470 EC-B, available as 20 and 16 tonne models, the 370 EC-B 16 Fibre, the 300 EC-B 12 Fibre and the 270 EC-B 12..

Practical applications of current and future alternative drive concepts will be demonstrated to trade visitors in live shows taking place several times a day. Liebherr will also be providing an insight and outlook on future-oriented services and solutions for its earthmoving and material handling machines at the main exhibition stand. The extensive portfolio of Liebherr attachments and quick coupling systems will be presented to the trade public in a separate area in Hall B5 at Stand 439.Find out more",News,10/24/2022,"At the outdoor stand FG 809-813 at Bauma 2022, the two product segments earthmoving and material handling machines will be extensively represented. In addition to an impressive live show, Liebherr will present its numerous product innovations and highlights in a static exhibition, among other things.. Forward-looking solutions: Alternative drives, digitalisation and serviceAs a continuation of the Bauma Showcase 2019, Liebherr will this year provide an insight into Liebherr's technology-open work in the field of alternative drive concepts, including live shows several times a day. Practical applications of the alternative drive technologies available today and in the near future for earthmoving and material handling machines will also be presented. Practical concepts will be shown, such as construction and handling machines powered by different primary energy sources such as diesel, HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil), electricity and hydrogen.In this context, several innovative machines will be on display, underlining Liebherr's wide-ranging work on alternative concepts: For example, the first battery-electric wheel loader and the first battery-electric telescopic handler from the company. Both of these Bauma exhibits are near-series pre-production units. Also part of the live shows is the Liebherr crawler excavator R 9XX H2. - the first Liebherr excavator powered by a hydrogen combustion engine. In addition to the Liebherr LH 26 M Industry E electric material handler, the Liebherr R 950 Tunnel E electric crawler excavator will also be featured in the live show. Both cable-operated electric machines are additionally equipped with a battery-powered Mobility Kit for temporary, off-grid operation.Beyond its work on alternative drives, Liebherr also takes its product responsibility very seriously in other areas. The aim is to offer customers safe, efficient and environmentally compatible products in the long term. This includes services such as the reman programme. Here, old components are reconditioned to the highest quality standards and can be used as an alternative to a new part if the customer wishes to replace a component. The old part is in no way inferior to a new part in terms of performance and reliability and also represents a resource-saving and at the same time economical alternative for the customer.Another focus of the trade fair presentation is the areas of digitalisation and service. Liebherr is continuously developing services and solutions together with sales and service partners and customers - digitalisation is playing an increasingly important role. In addition to the latest developments, customer solutions already available in the areas of driver support, construction site communication and automated data exchange will be presented. Liebherr invites customers and interested parties to discussions and an exchange of experiences at its stand.Progressive digitalisation also makes it possible to design services and solutions that are even more individual, consistent and transparent. A large number of new, digital solutions will be presented, with which an increase in efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and comfort can be achieved. For workshop managers, for example, performance and maintenance data on the machines will in future be clearly prepared in the MyLiebherr portal and made available for subsequent processes such as maintenance planning and spare parts ordering. Liebherr is also presenting numerous intelligent assistance systems and applications for the increasingly complex demands on machine operators: The MyAssistant for Earthmoving app, for example, provides machine operators with relevant information on all aspects of operating and maintaining Liebherr machines. Optimal support for the daily work of service technicians is provided by the Remote Service, which enables service for Liebherr earthmoving and material handling machines regardless of location and time.. World premiere: First Liebherr crawler excavator with hydrogen engineThe R 9XX H2 is a crawler excavator with a hydrogen combustion engine developed by Liebherr-France SAS in Colmar. The demonstration model of the installed H966 engine comes from Liebherr Machines Bulle SA in Switzerland.By using the hydrogen engine, pollutant emissions can be significantly reduced: The H2 drive in the crawler excavator on display does not require a permanent energy supply and causes only very low NOx and CO2 emissions.The R 9XX H2 meets the highest quality standards. It was developed on the design basis of the current and future-oriented crawler excavator generation 8. With it, the R 9XX H2 shares the focus on a more comfortable and efficient application. The crawler excavator develops the same overall performance as a diesel engine version, both in terms of power output and engine dynamics and response.Suitable for extreme temperatures, shocks and dust-intensive operations on the construction site, the R 9XX H2 with its operating weight of 50 tonnes can in future become just as robust a solution for earthmoving and quarrying applications as the conventionally powered Liebherr crawler excavators in the same class already are. The only differences are in the refuelling of the machines: Fast and safe refuelling is ensured by infrared communication between the excavator and the refuelling station, where users benefit from the standardised high-speed protocol.. The new 70 to 100 tonne crawler excavators from LiebherrAs part of the revision of the model range, the new Liebherr crawler excavators of the 5.2 and 6.2 generations will also be presented at Bauma 2022. The new models between 70 and 100 tonnes operating weight include numerous improvements and are characterised in particular by their optimised performance data, high comfort, new assistance systems and lower fuel consumption.The new R 972, R 978 SME, R  992 and R 998  SME crawler excavators replace the R 966, R 970  SME, R 976 and R 980 SME models. The new crawler excavators were developed at Liebherr's site in Colmar (France) with the aim of significantly reducing overall energy consumption. The new and patented Liebherr Power Efficiency (PE) - Engine Control system pays particular attention to this.The new model range is available with the Bucket Fill Assist function. This assistance system has an ""anti-stalling"" mode that prevents the bucket from blocking during the digging phase. Thus, this option provides the operator with additional support when using the machine and ensures higher productivity and more comfort. In addition to reducing fuel consumption, the Liebherr Bucket Fill Assist system also reduces the vibrations that would otherwise occur during work, improving operator comfort. The resulting reduced wear on the bucket also helps to reduce operating costs.On the Liebherr main stand, the R 992 will be presented as a representative of the new model series. The machine replaces the R 976 and guarantees 5 % more engine power. The crawler excavator, which weighs more than 94 tonnes, is powered by a powerful engine with 420 kW / 544 hp. It is equipped with an LC-V chassis, a ballast weight of 16 tonnes and a 600 mm floor plate.. Liebherr R 928 crawler excavator with factory-installed machine control from Leica GeosystemsThe R 928 crawler excavator impresses with high tractive effort, excellent lifting capacity and a large-capacity backhoe bucket. The operating weight of less than 30 tonnes has been optimised with the aim of making transport logistics between job sites as simple as possible. The R 928 complements the existing range of Liebherr crawler excavators with an additional model between the well-known R 926 and R 930 machines.The R 928 will be presented with Leica Geosystems' factory-installed semi-automatic machine control. This assistance system for controlling the machine is the key to precise and efficient work. The strategic partnership between Liebherr and Leica Geosystems, announced in March 2020, will enable the expertise of both companies to be made available to customers, providing even more advanced and reliable solutions. Factory-installed 2D and 3D machine controls will be available as an option for Liebherr crawler excavators and wheeled excavators of generations 6 and 8.. First ""live appearance"" of the Liebherr PR 766 bulldozer at Bauma 2022With the PR 766 bulldozer, Liebherr is expanding its fleet of Generation 8 earthmoving crawlers up to 55  tonnes operating weight. At the same time, the range of applications for this machine is being extended into the mining sector: like the largest Liebherr crawler PR 776, the machine now has the ""High Drive"" undercarriage, which has proven itself in heavy mining operations.As a multifunctional crawler tractor for material handling and raw material extraction: with a view to the PR 766's key applications, the latest machine generation offers customers enormous potential. The new undercarriage design in combination with the advantages of the cab and operator comfort promises full performance and productivity of machine and operator - even on stony ground and during long operations. At the same time, the diesel-hydraulic drive concept sets the Liebherr bulldozer apart from the competition with conventional torque converters. Here, similarly large efficiency advantages, especially in diesel consumption, as with the predecessor series and larger and smaller sister machines are realistic.. Numerous innovations in Liebherr Generation 8 wheel loadersIn the wheel loader segment, Liebherr is presenting two completely renewed series, the compact loaders and the medium-sized wheel loaders. The compact loaders, which include a new, additional model, the L 504  Compact, will be on show for the first time at a trade fair in Germany. Liebherr is also showing the medium-sized wheel loaders to a cross-industry audience for the first time. These new wheel loaders feature a significant performance boost compared to their predecessor models.Liebherr compact loaders will be represented at Bauma 2022 with the L 504 Compact and L 508 Compact models. The new L 504 Compact is the smallest wheel loader in the range. It embodies the qualities of larger Liebherr wheel loaders and impresses with a particularly good price-performance ratio. The L 546 model represents the medium-sized wheel loader series on the Liebherr stand. The trade fair exhibit is equipped with numerous intelligent assistance systems, such as the revised, powerful Skyview camera system or active personnel detection.. Liebherr railroad excavator with hydrostatic drive concept and new fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX®Liebherr is presenting the A 922 Rail Litronic at Bauma, a representative of the railroad segment. The trade fair exhibit is equipped with a hydrostatic drive concept and the new, fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX®. Liebherr will also be using the railroad machine to give trade visitors an outlook on solutions for the intelligent handling of attachments.. Debut on the international trade fair stage - TA 230 Litronic articulated dump truckThe TA 230 Litronic articulated dump truck will be presented on the international trade fair stage for the first time. The powerful, robust and efficient machine was developed for the toughest off-road applications and is thus predestined for applications in the field of overburden transport or the mining industry. But the machines are also successfully used in larger infrastructure projects and special applications such as tunnel construction. The Liebherr dump truck shows excellent performance across all areas of application.. Liebherr handling machines for a wide range of applicationsLiebherr's product portfolio of handling machines is large - at Bauma Liebherr is showing three representatives for different areas of application.With the LH 22 M Industry Litronic, Liebherr presents a material handler for efficient use in tree care and wood industry. A wide selection of matching attachments optimally rounds off the portfolio on site.Liebherr will also be presenting two of its electric material handlers: The LH  26 M Industry E with battery-powered Mobility Kit and the LH 150 M Port E with new mobile gantry undercarriage.In addition to scrap handling applications, the LH 26 M Industry E can also be used in recycling. The cable-connected electric material handler is equipped with a battery-powered Mobility Kit for temporary, mains-independent operation. It is mounted on the upper carriage of the machine for optimum accessibility and supplies the machine with electrical energy when disconnected from the mains. The Mobility Kit enables mains-independent, emission-free operation for up to 30 minutes. Instead of traversing, the energy can also be used for short-term, speed-reduced work.The Liebherr LH 150 M Port E handling machine is also equipped with an electric drive and can be seen at Bauma with a new, mobile gantry undercarriage. The electric handling machine is specially designed for handling bulk and general cargo in the port. With the mobile gantry undercarriage, trucks or wagons passing through can be loaded and unloaded quickly and efficiently.. Extensive portfolio of Liebherr attachments and quick coupling systemsLiebherr develops and produces innovative attachments and quick coupling systems to the highest quality standards. At Bauma, Liebherr will be presenting its extensive product portfolio on its own stand in Hall B5 Stand 439.For civil engineering applications, Liebherr will be showing the TR 20B, a representative of the new generation of tiltrotators.

Workout with 100 tonnes: the new LR 1100.1 from Liebherr,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/workout-with-100-tonnes-the-new-lr-1100-1-from-liebherr.html?page=24,The quick availability of crawler cranes is a decisive factor in the 100-tonne class. A requirement that the new LR 1100.1 fulfils perfectly making it the ideal multi-purpose crane on any construction site.Find out more,Press releases,10/24/2022,"The new crawler crane LR 1100.1 is optimised for all typical lifting applications in the 100-tonne class. It can be configured either with a main boom up to 62 metres, or with a main boom up to 44 metres in combination with a fixed jib up to 20 metres.The LR 1100.1 is fitted with the most powerful engine in its class - 230 kW provide the necessary performance for the lifting operations. Thanks to the Eco-Silent Mode, the engine speed can be reduced to a predefined level. This means that diesel consumption and noise emission are reduced but performance level remains the same. The Automatic Engine Stop Control offers a further economic and environmentally friendly solution. After checking certain system functions, the engine is switched off during longer work interruptions.Everything in focus: compact transport, self-assembly system, and radio remote controlThe crawler crane is optimised for quick transfer between construction sites. The transport width is 2,983 or 3,500 millimetres, depending on whether the crane is transported with or without crawlers. At the construction site, the assembly of the LR 1100.1 is simplified through the self-assembly system and radio remote control.Radio remote control allows the crane operator a high degree of flexibility and additional safety also during operation. The crane can be operated from outside the cabin and so allow for a better overview of the construction site. So-called blind spots can thus be avoided. Depending on the application, a second person is often no longer required to assist with hand signals during lifting operations. Furthermore, the cabin of the new crawler crane can be elevated by 2.8  metres, thus allowing for a good all-round view.Safety on the slopesFor the safe negotiation of slopes and inclines, the new crane is fitted with Gradient Travel Aid. The control system automatically calculates the centre of gravity and warns the operator before the crane leaves the safe area. While travelling, the operator constantly receives information about the permissible and actual gradient and the crane's overall centre of gravity. If necessary, the boom angle can be altered so that the machine remains in the safe area.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Outstanding: the LR 1400 SX is the tallest exhibit at the Liebherr stand,News |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/outstanding-the-lr-1400-sx-is-the-tallest-exhibit-at-the-liebherr-stand.html?page=24,"It is a big step for Liebherr in Nenzing and a response to the needs of the market. With the new LR 1400 SX, Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH extends its range of crawler cranes to include lifting capacities of up to 400 t.Find out more",News,10/24/2022,"It towers over the Statue of Liberty in New York, is as high as a football pitch is long, and with a height of 116 metres, the tallest exhibit at the Liebherr stand. Although the crawler crane at the Bauma is not even configured with the maximum boom length. If that was the case, it could lift loads onto the 170-metre-high Opernturm in Frankfurt, for example. For the Bauma, the crane is fitted with a 68-metre main boom and a 62-metre luffing jib. Gerhard Frainer, Managing Director Sales at the Austrian site, describes the machine as “a big step for the factory,” and adds, “The wish for a bigger crane came from the market.”Compact design for flexible operation and transportationWith the compact transport weight of 46 tonnes, the complete crane can be transported easily between jobsites. Platform and railings remain attached to the uppercarriage during transportation and only need to be folded down. Thanks to the crane’s self-assembly system, the boom sections, the carbody counterweight, crawlers, and hoist winches can be easily assembled and disassembled without the need for an auxiliary crane. The crane can even hydraulically lift, lower, and secure the 150-tonne rear counterweight without assistance. The rear counterweight itself is modular and can be equipped with 5 or 10-tonne counterweight slabs, depending on requirements.Just how flexible and mobile the crane is, can be seen when space is restricted. The four crawler drives make it easier to manoeuvre the LR 1400 SX on jobsites where space is tight. Thanks to the track width adjustment, access on narrow roads is enormously simplified.Maximum safety through assistance systemsLiebherr paid particular attention to the safety concept while designing the crane. One highlight is the Gradient Travel Aid for the safe negotiation of slopes. The crane’s control system automatically calculates the centre of gravity and warns the operator before the crane leaves the safe area. While travelling, the operator constantly receives information about the permissible and actual gradient, and the crane's overall centre of gravity. If necessary, the boom angle can be altered so that the machine remains in the safe area.The Ground Pressure Visualization of the LR 1400 SX calculates the current ground pressure of the crane in real time and compares it with the specified safety limits of the relevant position. The ground pressure is displayed in the operator’s cabin. This means the operator is permanently aware of whether the machine is situated in, or is approaching, a critical area. The ground pressure of the crane can also be reduced using the ground pressure reduction plates. During lifting work, the operator can lower these plates to significantly increase the crane's ground contact area. The ground pressure under the crane can thus be reduced by more than half. This safety feature is also particularly useful when lifting long booms from the ground.The Boom Up-and-Down Assistant is also part of the safety concept. When erecting or lowering the boom, this assistance system indicates the approach to the tipping border and automatically stops operation before the operator unintentionally enters an unsafe zone. The operator no longer has to move the winches of the main boom and luffing jib separately. Controlled folding of the luffing jib begins at the press of a button. The speed of the laying down procedure is controlled with a single joystick. The Boom-Up-and-Down Assistant chooses the safest method for laying down the jib.Flexible and safe operationRadio remote control gives the crane operator a high degree of flexibility and additional safety also during operation. The crane can be operated from outside the cabin and so allow for a better overview of the construction site. So-called blind spots can thus be avoided. Depending on the application, a second person is no longer required to assist with hand signals during lifting operations.While developing the LR 1400 SX, special attention was paid to customer needs. The simple switching of the boom is very much appreciated. This means that various fixed and luffing jibs from the LR 1300 can also be installed on this crane.As a multi-purpose crane, the LR 1400 SX is used in a wide variety of projects. Whether expanding the infrastructure with bridges or tunnels, constructing stadiums or factories with steel or precast concrete elements, working in the energy sector, lifting work on high buildings, or barge applications - anything is possible..

Liebherr’s most powerful standard crane at Bauma 2022: The 1188 EC-H high-top crane with fibre rope ,News |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-s-most-powerful-standard-crane-at-bauma-2022-the-1188-ec-h-high-top-crane-with-fibre-rope.html?page=25,"Liebherr is unveiling its most powerful standard crane, the 1188 EC-H 40 Fibre, at the construction machinery trade fair in Munich, marking an upward expansion of its standard product portfolio.Find out more",News,10/24/2022,"The improvements that are possible using Liebherr's fibre rope technology are impressively demonstrated by the latest addition to the EC-H series: the new 1188 EC H 40 Fibre is capable of lifting up to 13,100 kilograms at the jib head, at a jib length of 80 metres. This means that the Fibre model surpasses the already powerful 1000 EC-H steel rope crane by up to 2.1 tonnes in terms of jib head load capacity. The standard maximum reach of the 1188 EC H 40 Fibre is as long as 90 metres, which increases the range of possible uses on site. Freestanding hook heights of up to 81.3 metres can be achieved in a most cost-effective way in combination with the 24 HC 1000 tower system.. Efficient solution for large construction sites“The 1188 EC-H 40 is our first high-top crane with fibre rope technology. We’ve increased the performance capacity of our EC-H series even further with this crane and can now offer our customers even greater support for the implementation of large and custom projects,” says Markus Kinateder, Product Manager, Liebherr-Werk Biberach GmbH. Powerful performance, impressive cost-efficiency and careful use of resources: Liebherr’s new high-top crane with fibre rope design offers customers an efficient solution for their site needs. The lighter weight of the fibre rope enables a lighter crane design compared to that of a steel rope model. Fibre rope also has a longer service life than steel rope.The EC-H crane excels at moving heavy loads. Thanks to its slewing platform concept with external cabin and the compact 24 HC 1000 tower system, the crane also impresses during transport and assembly. Liebherr's own high-performance drives ensure a high handling capacity, which in turn contributes positively to the workflows on site. Various climbing and rigging systems enable the machines to reach impressive hook heights. Smart assistance systems help the crane operator to operate their tower crane efficiently and safely. The ergonomically equipped LiCAB cabin provides optimal comfort when working and a comprehensive view of the construction site.. Fibre rope advantages at a glanceThe high-tensile fibre rope, which is the result of 10 years of development work by Liebherr and the rope manufacturer Teufelberger, is a groundbreaking technology. Fibre cranes achieve significantly higher performance values compared to their steel rope counterparts. The fibre rope is more durable, easier to handle when reeving due to its lighter weight, and maintenance is less complicated as lubrication isn’t required. And on top of all that, operational safety is also increased; crane operators are able to see at a glance when the fibre rope needs replacing. The components of the rope’s cover wear out at different rates – a red layer indicates that the rope has reached the end of its service life."
Future alternatives: Three types of low-emission drive for Liebherr telescopic handlers,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/future-alternatives-three-types-of-low-emission-drive-for-liebherr-telescopic-handlers.html?page=25,"There is hardly any other product in the Liebherr earthmoving segment, where the portfolio of international customer applications is as diverse as with telescopic handlers. The various machine applications, combined with ranging local environmental regulations and subsidy programs, the availability of primary energy sources and infrastructural requirements, make a standardised low-emission drive all but impossible.Find out more",Press releases,10/24/2022,"Regardless of application, be it for a construction site or event logistics, horticulture or industrial materials handling, daily municipal use or disaster control: Telescopic handlers offer the greatest possible flexibility for lifting and transporting a wide variety of loads for customers all over the world. In addition to already supplying a wide range of application requirements, with a total of eight telescopic handler models in 26 versions, Liebherr continues to pursue further development of this type of machine with a primary focus on “maximising performance with the greatest possible environmental compatibility”.Compatibility of customer and environmental demandsFor telescopic handler applications, selection of the correct model is traditionally influenced by a variety of factors, such as lifting height, load capacity, drive and operating hydraulics speeds, desired handling capacity, single or multi-shift operation, ease of use and driver comfort, together with the number and functionality of the work tools to be operated.Within the goal of maximising performance with the greatest possible environmental compatibility, other parameters are becoming increasingly important. These include, the location and the respective environmental regulations (inside or outside, local environmental zones with regulations for air and noise emissions, etc.), movement distances of the machine, availability of energy sources (electricity, “green fuel” etc.) and the necessary infrastructure (power quality, charging stations, fuel stations, etc.).Liebherr is concerned with the technologies of energy conversion (engines), which are available today and in the foreseeable future, and suitable energy carriers (fuels) for these engines. With this in mind, the following three telescopic handler drive concepts, optimised for type of customer and/or application, will be outlined at Bauma 2022.. Existing hydrostatic drive, new environmentally friendly fuel - made from hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO)HVO is a synthetic, but sustainable fuel that is growing in importance at Liebherr. It is the first fuel available commercially that can be used with conventional combustion engines in an almost climate-neutral manner. Its production is climate-neutral if electricity from renewable energy sources is used exclusively during production. In addition, it produces lower emissions in actual use than a machine running on fossil diesel fuel.Due to the good compatibility with all engine components and the miscibility with fossil diesel, the barrier to entry or conversion is low for customers. It is even possible to switch back to fossil diesel during operation, for example, in the event of procurement bottlenecks. Basic processes at the end customer do not have to change either: The drive concept remains in place without loss of performance, there are no other maintenance steps and no additional technical training is required.In combination with the highly efficient Liebherr hydrostatic drive, HVO offers enormous potential for construction or mixed-use customers to reduce their CO2 footprint, as quickly as possible, without new investment, and is ready for use in low emission zones (e.g. urban operating zones).The extent to which HVO will prevail in the market place, over the long term, depends primarily on the development of global production volumes and the associated availability. Despite significantly increasing production, HVO is only widely accessible in a few countries in Europe. For Liebherr, it is clear that the HVO solution is only environmentally and socially acceptable if palm oil is not used in production and rainforests are not cleared to gain new cultivation areas. The Group ensures this together with its HVO suppliers.. Local zero emissions based on electric battery drive telescopic handlerIn addition to low-emission solutions, completely emission-free alternatives will soon be in demand in some countries and regions: For example, in Norway, all municipal construction sites, from 2025 onwards, and in general all public and private construction sites, from 2030 onwards, will be required to be operated emission-free. The local emission-free solution for the Liebherr telescopic handler is a modular high-voltage battery design paired with an electric drive, which can be scaled according to customer requirements and application, and is equipped with on-board charging electronics.This drive is particularly suitable for indoor applications, such as recycling, and offers an impressive increase in driver comfort, low noise emissions and optimised vibration behaviour. This new “quiet power” drive also allows problem free night shift operation, and, with the battery capacities available today, an average single-shift can be completed before recharging. Recharging occurs without a special power charger and is therefore possible at any location. The overall efficiency of the system can be further increased thanks to the option of energy recovery.Due to the charging times, switch over to an electric machine requires certain organisational changes for the customer. But equally, this drive uses electricity, the most widely available source for self-generated primary energy, and offers control and regulation advantages in use. This advantage also applies to the hybrid drive concept described below.. 20 percent and above: Fuel savings with the Liebherr hybrid conceptThe third potential telescopic handler drive concept - a serial hybrid with ""plug-in"" - guarantees customers are not restricted by range and also allows operation without a battery. Of the three systems presented, it has the highest overall efficiency and the ability to recuperate energy when braking and lowering the boom. This means fuel savings of more than 20 percent are achievable.Fundamentally, though, this drive version has a larger number of components and, like the electric battery model, it requires personnel specially trained in high-voltage electronics. On the other hand, this design offers a higher performance capacity (boost), which can be called up through two energy sources and be drawn off in parallel. This will prove particularly useful in mixed industrial indoor/outdoor operation. It is currently possible to operate the telescopic handler purely electrically for up to two hours, for example in a hall, and to work in hybrid mode outdoors.. The three drive concepts at Bauma 2022: Presentation and DiscussionAs part of the live shows taking place, several times a day, during Bauma 2022, Liebherr will provide an insight into their open technology work in the field of alternative drive concepts. Included in the range of presentations will be the electric battery version of the Liebherr telescopic handler. All three drive concepts can be seen in the Innovation Lab.

Bauma 2022: Live Première of the Liebherr PR 766 G8,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/bauma-2022-live-premiere-of-the-liebherr-pr-766-g8.html?page=25,"The PR 766 G8 further expands the Liebherr fleet of Generation 8 earthmoving crawlers, with an operating weight of up to 55 tonnes.Find out more",Press releases,10/24/2022,"A multifunctional bulldozer for materials handling and mining operation: The Liebherr PR 766 G8 is the latest machine generation, specifically developed to let customers take full advantage of its enormous potential in key applications. The newly designed running gear works in combination with all the advantages of cab and operating comfort to maximise man/machine performance and productivity - even on rough, stony ground over long operating periods. The diesel-hydraulic drive design sets the Liebherr crawler dozer a league ahead of the competition, with conventional torque converters. Particularly in diesel consumption, this gives the down-to-earth advantages in efficiency shown by previous generations as well as larger and smaller sister machines.Performance and Economy: advanced, infinitely variable drive designThe new PR 766 G8 is powered by a Liebherr 8-cylinder diesel engine with a maximum output of 360 kW (490 hp) and meets Stage V and Tier 4f emission standards. The operating weight of the hydrostatic dozer is up to 54.3 t, with available blade capacities of 13.6 m³ (Semi-U blade) or 17 m³ (U-blade).The infinitely variable hydrostatic Liebherr drive design allows customers to operate the PR 766 G8 to maximise utilisation and savings in resources: The drive components and the intelligent Liebherr engine management system are perfectly synchronised, so that diesel engine is kept at constant speed, within the optimum fuel-efficiency range (~ 1,600 rpm), by the hydrostatic drive. This really sets the Liebherr propulsion drive apart from similar D9 class drive designs available on the market, where the engine speed fluctuates significantly during use.All Generation 8 Liebherr crawler dozers have the ECO function fitted as standard. The driver can select between high performance (including automatic Power Boost) and maximum economy, to ensure further fuel savings in light to medium-duty applications.The complete Liebherr drive train, therefore, contributes to high efficiency and significantly lower fuel consumption compared to the industry standard for the same pushing performance.Reliability: tough components from in-house productionLiebherr engines have been proving themselves in construction machinery applications, all over the world, for decades. Developed for the harshest of operating conditions, the robust build and state-of-art technology of these engines assure optimum operational safety and length of service life. The proven and tested hydrostatic Liebherr drive does away with the need for high-wear components, such as manual transmissions, steering clutches or service brakes. Instead, it operates with high-quality hydraulic pumps and motors that are virtually wear-free and highly reliable in service.For highly demanding, special applications, such as in the desert, at low temperatures or in special industry operation (mining, wood, paper, etc.), Liebherr offers a wide range of tried and tested modifications ex works.Drive design optimised and fit for purpose: High Drive for heavy mining operationsTo match the heavy operating demands of rocky terrain more closely, the drive design of the larger 70-tonne dozer has been specifically adapted for the PR 766 G8.Swivel bearing guide wheels and track rollers absorb shocks and maintain very good track chain traction. This allows the running gear to adapt more closely to the ground surface when driving over rocky terrain, but a more critical factor is the raised position of the final drive: High Drive reduces wear on sprockets and bearing bushes and protects the final drive and its seals from damage and dirt.Driver comfort: advanced cab design with intuitive controlsThe driver’s stand has been specially developed for this class of equipment so that the operator can readily find his way around. Using the Liebherr proven joystick function, he is able to control all driving and steering movements with just one electronic input device.The cabin is packed with special features, including the centralised controls, a 9'' touch display, generous storage space and a cool box. The driver can use the display to access all the key machine parameters and simply set operating modes, such as the ECO function, automatic engine speed reduction or the drive and the steering response, as well as operate the convenience and safety functions, such as the standard reversing camera.The PR 766 G8 has a spacious workstation, offering the best conditions for fatigue free operation. All the controls for traction drive, blade and ripper can be set by the driver to the most ergonomic position for him. The ergonomic joystick is designed for the optimum hand position to ensure the best possible comfort while operating. The seat has an integrated contact switch to automatically detect the driver’s presence, without having to operate a safety lever.Maximum safety: excellent view of work equipment and surroundingsThe modern design of the new Liebherr PR 766 G8 gives the driver a clear view in all directions, enabling highly effective work and progress and increasing safety in daily operation.The design includes rounded body edges and sloping sides, panoramic glazing and a minimal profile for the cab-integrated ROPS/FOPS protection, to ensure optimum all-round visibility of the terrain, blade and rear ripper. This leaves an unhindered view to the front and side work area. It is not impeded by the exhaust system or the continuous work platform. The platform gives access to the cab, as well as to the service points and the filler nozzles for hydraulic and operating fluids.Modern LEDs (1,200 lm) are used for optimum illumination of the work area. Modular lighting (including additional headlights or high-performance LEDs with 4,200 lm) is an integral part of the machine design and allows the best match of lighting to the corresponding application.Optimum service accessibility and long replacement intervalsThe new Liebherr dozer is designed for quick maintenance access and easy servicing, with centralised maintenance points, wide-opening access hatches and engine compartment doors, a standard tilting driver's cab and an optional cooling fan that can be swung out for cleaning.Furthermore, all Liebherr dozers for mining (PR 766 and 776) have Ground Level Service Stations at the rear of the machines. Daily maintenance and service work can be conducted quickly and safely at ground level. The electrical systems include switches for access lighting, an emergency stop and Ground Level Lockout (electrical system deactivation for maintenance). For operating fluids and fuels, there is a quick-change connection for engine, pump transfer case and hydraulic oil as well as a quick refuelling device.Liebherr's standard fleet management system, LiDAT, allows for call-up and effective management of necessary service work, warning messages, machine position, current consumption data and fluid fill levels. Depending on the subscription agreement, data is updated several times a day and can be called up at any time via the Internet. An automatic alarm can be set up for high priority notifications/info, e.g., when the device leaves a predefined zone or in the event of critical operating states..

Liebherr at Bauma 2022: Digital solutions and smart assistance systems ,News |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-at-bauma-2022-digital-solutions-and-smart-assistance-systems.html?page=25,"Digitalisation offers the construction industry diverse opportunities for further increasing performance, reliability and safety on site. As a holistic solutions provider, Liebherr Tower Cranes is sharing insights into new digital developments around crane operation at the construction machinery trade fair in Munich.Find out more",News,10/24/2022,"Liebherr is launching comprehensive Crane Information Models (CIM models) for precise construction site planning over the coming months. These models make the work of architects and construction planners easier, as they allow key information regarding crane deployment to be taken into account early on in the process, and therefore ensure the right choice of crane for the job at hand. With decades of accumulated expertise, Liebherr’s Tower Crane Solutions project department also provides support with cost-effective construction site planning.Quick communication, intuitive operationFurther improvements for more efficient load handling are also in the spotlight. Thanks to the interface of the Tower Crane Operating System, which a number of cranes already feature, crane operators and service technicians are able to navigate their way through a needs-based menu structure via touch display. The LiReCon teleoperation unit for tower cranes offers insight into what future machine operation will look like and the opportunities this will bring. The LiReCon teleoperation stand can, for example, be stationed directly where the site supervisor works. This means that crane operators and site supervisors will be able to interact with each other in future and discuss changes in person without delay. LiReCon will also offer the option of switching between different tower cranes, which will enable a flexible response to situations on site as they happen.In addition, intelligent assistance systems are there to make work easier for crane operators. These assistance systems also contribute to safety on site, which is why Liebherr is committed to their ongoing further development. The new Tower Crane OS offers new possibilities in this context. The new assistance systems actively counteract dangerous situations, such as excessive swinging of loads. Liebherr is showing the first prototypes as part of an interactive experience at the construction machinery trade fair.Digital “Site Monitoring” solutionThe right data is useful in evaluating the success of a construction project on its completion. Although every construction site is different, it is nevertheless possible to learn from processes for subsequent projects. This is where Liebherr’s digital “Site Monitoring” solution comes into play. Relevant crane data can be easily recorded, displayed and analysed. Such information also provides site supervisors and construction planners with a reliable overview of efficiency and construction progress.“We are continuing to see significant efforts being made to increase efficiency on construction sites. In terms of Liebherr tower crane products, this means supporting construction processes with transparent information during planning, execution and downstream analysis,” says Tobias Scholz, Global Market Manager, Liebherr-Werk Biberach GmbH.

Featuring high-tensile fibre rope, the crane is ideal for high lifting capacities and is therefore a great choice for bridge, power station and plant construction.Find out more",Press releases,10/24/2022,"The improvements that are possible using Liebherr's fibre rope technology are impressively demonstrated by the latest addition to the EC-H series: the new 1188 EC H 40 Fibre is capable of lifting up to 13,100 kilograms at the jib head, at a jib length of 80 metres. This means that the Fibre model surpasses the already powerful 1000 EC-H steel rope crane by up to 2.1 tonnes in terms of jib head load capacity. The standard maximum reach of the 1188 EC H 40 Fibre is as long as 90 metres, which increases the range of possible uses on site. Freestanding hook heights of up to 81.3 metres can be achieved in a most cost-effective way in combination with the 24 HC 1000 tower system.Efficient solution for large construction sites“The 1188 EC-H 40 is our first high-top crane with fibre rope technology. We’ve increased the performance capacity of our EC-H series even further with this crane and can now offer our customers even greater support for the implementation of large and custom projects,” says Markus Kinateder, Product Manager, Liebherr-Werk Biberach GmbH. Powerful performance, impressive cost-efficiency and careful use of resources: Liebherr’s new high-top crane with fibre rope design offers customers an efficient solution for their site needs. The lighter weight of the fibre rope enables a lighter crane design compared to that of a steel rope model. Fibre rope also has a longer service life than steel rope.The EC-H crane excels at moving heavy loads. Thanks to its slewing platform concept with external cabin and the compact 24 HC 1000 tower system, the crane also impresses during transport and assembly. Liebherr's own high-performance drives ensure a high handling capacity, which in turn contributes positively to the workflows on site. Various climbing and rigging systems enable the machines to reach impressive hook heights. Smart assistance systems help the crane operator to operate their tower crane efficiently and safely. The ergonomically equipped LiCAB cabin provides optimal comfort when working and a comprehensive view of the construction site.Fibre rope advantages at a glanceThe high-tensile fibre rope, which is the result of 10 years of development work by Liebherr and the rope manufacturer Teufelberger, is a groundbreaking technology. Fibre cranes achieve significantly higher performance values compared to their steel rope counterparts. The fibre rope is more durable, easier to handle when reeving due to its lighter weight, and maintenance is less complicated as lubrication isn’t required. And on top of all that, operational safety is also increased; crane operators are able to see at a glance when the fibre rope needs replacing. The components of the rope’s cover wear out at different rates – a red layer indicates that the rope has reached the end of its service life..

Liebherr presents upgraded MK 140-5.1 at Bauma 2022 ,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-presents-upgraded-mk-140-5-1-at-bauma-2022.html?page=25,"Liebherr's most powerful mobile construction crane, the optimised MK 140-5.1, is making its first public appearance at the construction machinery trade fair in Munich. Construction firms, timber frame companies and crane rental businesses alike can put the five-axle crane to flexible use, from short jobs in densely built-up inner city areas to work on plants such as refineries. Customers benefit from familiar operation across all machines in the MK series. Future normative regulations will be met through further development.Find out more",Press releases,10/24/2022,"The MK 140-5.1 offers lifting capacities of up to 8,000 kilograms. What makes the MK particularly special is that, alongside its standard use as a trolley jib crane, it also features the VarioJib concept. This makes operation in luffing mode and a reach of up to 65 metres possible. As a result, the crane is ideal for installing air-conditioning systems, balconies and windows, as well as for supporting overhaul work at chemical plants and refineries. “Thanks to its compact size and minimal space requirements in terms of assembly, operation and dismantling, the MK 140-5.1 is perfect for use in urban areas,” says Daniel Nötzel, Product Manager, Liebherr-Werk Biberach GmbH. “Through the integration of Trolley-Plus, it has been possible to achieve a load capacity increase of up to 50 percent in luffed position, which makes the crane even more flexible.”All-electric crane operationThe crane’s ecological and future-oriented hybrid power concept enables all-electric operation with site power or another external power source. This means that the crane is extremely quiet when working, something which is a particular advantage for sites that are active at night. The MK cranes are compatible with Liebherr’s Liduro Power Port (LPO), a mobile energy storage system for supplying power to construction sites. Hybrid and all-electric construction machines can be operated or charged locally with zero emissions using the mobile energy storage system. If an external power source isn’t available, an efficient diesel generator ensures the MK’s self-sufficient operation.Both the superstructure and undercarriage drives of these cranes can be powered by HVO (Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils). HVO is fuel produced from hydrogenated vegetable oils, and preferably from waste. Our production sites have been shipping mobile construction cranes with this fuel since January 2022. All-electric operation and refuelling with HVO helps to reduce emissions and promotes climate neutrality on construction sites in the long term.Ready to start work in a matter of minutesThe MK series, which also includes the MK 73-3.1 and the MK 88-4.1, makes it easy to manage multiple jobs in different locations on the same day. MK cranes are ready to work within a matter of minutes and only need one person for transport, assembly and operation. No additional transport vehicles are needed, saving both time and costs. Thanks to a vertical tower, the taxi cranes can work directly at buildings, require little space and can achieve extensive working radii with considerable performance capacity..

Liebherr crawler concrete pump for special civil engineering at Bauma,Press releases |10/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-crawler-concrete-pump-for-special-civil-engineering-at-bauma.html?page=25,Liebherr is showing a 110 D-K crawler concrete pump for special civil engineering together with a Liebherr LRB 23 piling and drilling rig at Bauma in Munich. Both units often work in tandem on construction sites.Find out more,Press releases,10/24/2022,"The Liebherr crawler concrete pump is normally used in bored pile foundations to supply concrete to a drilling rig. This work involves deep drilling holes to prepare the ground for construction. When the drill is pulled out, these holes are filled with concrete. In the process, the concrete is conveyed down via a tube in the middle of the drill. The crawler concrete pump travels in parallel with the drilling rig to the various application positions, with the concrete hose remaining connected to the drilling rig. The Liebherr crawler concrete pump is also suitable for various other types of pumping applications.Data exchange via radio optimises workflows on the construction siteThe crawler concrete pump and the drilling rig are connected by radio and can thus communicate and exchange information on the construction site. The recurring processes of drilling, pulling and pumping can thus be optimised: the driver of the drilling rig can start and stop the pumping process from his cabin, accurate to the second. This contributes to both simpler and more efficient workflows taking less time.Two high-quality models: robust, powerful and easy to maintainThe robust crawler concrete pump is available in two performance classes, the THS 110 D-K and the THS 140 D-K. The more powerful version manages up to 135 m³ per hour. Both types are equipped with powerful six-cylinder engines. The powerful pump units run very quietly and have very good suction performance. The hydraulic system is particularly easy to maintain thanks to the open hydraulic circuit. The design also facilitates the replacement of wearing parts, which greatly simplifies servicing. The shape of the feed hopper without edges or protrusions also reduces concrete residues and dirt. The machine's extensive equipment also includes a capacious 500-litre water tank with water pump and a lockable tool box.

Hydrogen combustion engines are one technology being explored by the Group. The R 9XX H2, Liebherr’s first hydrogen-powered crawler excavator, has now won the Bauma Innovation Award. The prototype was developed by Liebherr-France SAS, based in Colmar, France. The machine is powered by an H966 hydrogen combustion engine. It was produced at Liebherr Machines Bulle SA, the Liebherr Group’s engine competence centre in the Swiss canton of Fribourg.In terms of power, dynamics and responsiveness, the R 9XX H2 hydrogen excavator gives nothing away to any conventionally powered machine. Nor is it dependent on a continuous energy supply either. The emissions make the difference: On a “tank to wheel” basis, i.e. when used on a construction site, a hydrogen excavator emits almost no CO2. “Cradle to grave” or from production to decommissioning, CO2 emissions are 70% lower than those of comparable conventionally powered excavators. Suitable for use under extreme temperatures, shock, and high-dust conditions on construction sites, the 50 tonne-operating weight R 9XX H2 may in future offer a robust solution for earthworks and quarrying applications.The R 9XX H2 is powered by a Liebherr H966 hydrogen combustion engine. The engine has six cylinders and uses port fuel injection (PFI), which Liebherr employs along with direct injection (DI) for its hydrogen engines. Liebherr’s components product segment plans to start with the series production of hydrogen motors by 2025.. Visitors to the Bauma fair in Munich can experience the Liebherr R9XX H2 hydrogen excavator live from 24 to 30 October 2022. The excavator is part of a machine show at the Liebherr booth in the outdoor area, where the company is exhibiting a variety of machines and prototypes with alternative drive systems. The booth even offers a hands-on encounter with the second prototype of the H966 hydrogen combustion engine. It can be found in the “InnovationLab”, an exhibition area devoted to Liebherr's open approach to alternative drive concepts. Another four-cylinder prototype of a 4-cylinder hydrogen engine, the H964 with direct injection (DI), can be seen at the Liebherr Components booth 326 in hall A4.The Bauma Innovation Award rewarding innovation2022 sees the thirteenth presentation of the Bauma Innovation Award. Its five categories – climate protection, digitalisation, mechanical engineering, building and research – reflect political, social, economic and ecological challenges. The expert jury’s focus on criteria such as practical orientation, economic potential, environmental protection aspects, resource conservation, efficiency and humanisation the workplace. The prize is awarded by Messe München and the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), together with the Federation of the German Construction Industry (HDB), the German Construction Confederation (ZDB) and the German Building Materials Federation (bbs)..

World premiere: Liebherr debuts crawler excavator with a hydrogen engine,Press releases | 10/23/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/world-premiere-liebherr-debuts-crawler-excavator-with-a-hydrogen-engine.html?page=26,"In times of climate change, which calls for extensive measures to protect the environment and in particular to reduce pollutant emissions, it is one of the tasks of construction machinery manufacturers to develop low-emission solutions.Find out more",Press releases,10/23/2022,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr will debut a crawler excavator developed by Liebherr-France SAS in Colmar, equipped with an integrated hydrogen combustion engine. The model on display of the installed H966 engine comes from Liebherr Machines Bulle SA in Switzerland.. Significant reduction of pollutant emissionsThe H2 drive in the crawler excavator on display does not require a permanent energy supply and emits extremely low levels of NOx and CO2. Depending on the assessment method used in each case, and whether the entire life cycle of the machine is taken into account, the hydrogen combustion engine can reduce CO2 emissions by almost 100%, when considering ""tank to wheel” or by 70%, when considering the ""cradle to grave"" principle.. The H966 engine – heart of the machineThe first Liebherr hydrogen engine, the H966, is the heart of the new R 9XX H2 excavator. This is an engine designed for both demonstration and field trials and is based on an intake manifold injection technology (also known as PFI). The achieved results offer evidence of a great potential in hydrogen propulsion and argue in favour of using such drives for off-road applications as well.The group is now presenting its extensive expertise along with the first resulting product. In addition, the components division is working on further hydrogen-based drive technologies, such as H2 direct injection. The latter enables a higher power density than the established H2 intake manifold injection and is, thus, particularly suitable for heavy-duty applications in demanding working environments, such as the construction and mining industries.. The R 9XX H2 crawler excavator: a powerful, safe and environmentally friendly solutionThe R 9XX H2 meets highest quality standards as all crawler excavators by Liebherr-France SAS do. Its design is based on the current and future generation 8 of crawler excavators. With it, the R 9XX H2 shares a focus on a more comfortable and efficient application. The excavator reaches the same overall performance as its diesel engine counterpart, both in terms of power output, engine dynamics and response. Suitable for extreme temperatures, shock and dust-intensive site operations, the R 9XX H2, with its operating weight of 50 tons, can become as robust a solution for earthmoving and quarrying applications in the future as the conventionally powered Liebherr crawler excavators in the same class already are. The only differences are in refuelling the machines: Fast and safe refuelling is ensured via infrared communication between the excavator and the refuelling station, where users benefit from the standardised high-speed protocol.Henrik Weitze, project manager at Liebherr-France SAS, also emphasises: ""The tests carried out in Colmar were extremely convincing. This technology promises many advantages for us in the future, especially in the most challenging applications."". DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr: Winner of the Red Dot Award for brand design,Press releases |10/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-winner-of-the-red-dot-award-for-brand-design.html?page=26,"In 2021, the Liebherr website and many other media were given a new look and feel. The basis for this is the revised brand design. The Group has now won the Red Dot Award for this.Find out more",Press releases,10/21/2022,"New design guidelines have been developed to ensure that everything really looks like the ""Liebherr"" brand; from the crane, to the production building, to the new customer portal. Specialists refer to the systematic design of contact points with the brand as ""brand design"". The Liebherr Group recently revised its brand design and has now won the Red Dot Award in the category ""Brands & Communication Design"" for its efforts.Liebherr manufactures construction machinery, refrigerators and many other products for its customers. The range comprises 13 product segments. 140 Liebherr companies around the world are responsible for development, production and service. On average, the company take part in more than 200 exhibitions around the world every year. Innumerable brochures, websites, online portals, films, pictures and illustrations give an insight into the Liebherr world. Everything should be visually unmistakeable in the way that it portrays the brand character and should enable the observer to intuitively experience Liebherr. The brand design describes how that works.. Revised design: Unmistakeable brand experience, high recognition valueThe starting shot for revising the Liebherr brand design fell in 2017. Until then, a style guide had set tight limits on the creative freedom of Liebherr's graphic designers. All printed pages were required to have the same appearance; social media profiles and web portals were to recreate the Liebherr website as faithfully as possible. The characteristic Liebherr logo was not ideally reproduced when it was used in a compact format in an app or as a favicon in a browser tab. So it was time for a cautious rejuvenation, to modernise the appearance of the company with a design that allows new media and new formats without completely abandoning tradition. The Design teams at Liebherr joined forces with the MetaDesign agency and other service providers.Four years later, the designers presented the revised brand design to their colleagues from the Group. A special Liebherr font, a logo that has been optimised for digital media, a revised colour concept, a modular design system and many other elements make the Liebherr brand design a source of inspiration and a reliable guideline for employees. The elements can now be used for all media to create user-friendly and an unmistakeable brand experience with high recognition value. Even illustrations, films and animated graphics that clearly explain complex technologies and processes and which therefore have to be flexibly created are now always unambiguously identifiable as Liebherr designs.. Brand design for new requirementsAlexandra Federle and Holger Spreda of Liebherr-International Deutschland GmbH in Biberach/Riss are managing the Brand Design project at Liebherr. ""The company's brand design requirements have been made much stricter due to the wide range of communications channels that are available today,"" Spreda explains. Design has to be immediately recognisable at a glance and must convey the brand values. At the same time it should surprise and entertain. ""Digital media, explanatory videos and animations in particular make the whole issue highly complex,"" adds Federle. To make this user friendly, the designers had to be able to work with maximum flexibility. At all times they had to take account of the cultural differences in the viewing habits of their audience. A squaring of the circle that the revised Liebherr brand design has mastered well, as the Red Dot Award demonstrates.For a company like Liebherr, branding is an ongoing task on which lots of departments work together. Work on brand design is not yet complete. Trends change perceptions. New products and media create new applications almost every day. The Liebherr designers approach this challenge with passion and creativity.The Red Dot Award in the category ""Brands & Communication Design"" will be presented on 28 October 2022.

Here are 5 more intriguing facts about the crane.Find out more",Listicle,10/20/2022,". At Bauma 2016, Liebherr presented the fibre rope technology as a world first. Today, many cranes are already equipped with fibre rope technology as standard. Brand new is the 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre as the first representative of the Liebherr luffing jib cranes.. . The 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre works with a 25-millimetre thick fibre rope. It is significantly lighter than a steel rope of comparable diameter. This enables greater lifting capacities and faster working speeds with a similar crane design, which applies to all Liebherr Fibre cranes.. . The 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre achieves comparable hook heights to the 230 HC-L 8/16. With a maximum jib length of about 60 metres, the maximum load capacity is still 2.5 t, meaning it could still lift two cars without any problem. And the maximum load capacity in 1-strand operation has been increased by 25 percent to 10 t.. . Like its brothers in steel rope design, the 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre also features our smart assistance systems such as horizontal load path, the well-known fine positioning mode ""Micromove"" or the extremely precise working range limitation (ABB) as standard.. . Incidentally, the fibre rope enables the 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre to drive the construction of skyscrapers and industrial plants even more efficiently. Even enormous hook heights, little space and nearby neighbouring properties do not pose a problem for this crane when constructing tall buildings in densely built-up city centres..

The two cranes have the ability to work in wind speeds of up to a Force 9 severe gale (75-88 km/h), meaning vessels can be unloaded all year round, in nearly all weather conditions. Among the benefits of the cranes is their ability to run on HVO 100.. HVO as an alternative fuel at LiebherrCleaner drive concepts for vehicles and machines are becoming more important than ever in order to reduce CO2 emissions. Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils (HVO) play an important role at Liebherr. HVO is an alternative fuel, which can now be used in the majority of the Liebherr construction machines, cranes and mining equipment in pure form or in addition to fossil diesel.When working on new drive concepts Liebherr relies on HVO, among others, as an alternative fuel. Its manufacture is climate-neutral if electricity is solely generated from renewable energy sources. In addition, it generates fewer emissions during its use than a machine operated with fossil diesel fuel. This becomes clear in a comparison: During the life cycle of a product the greenhouse gas emissions can be lowered by up to 90% if the machine is fuelled with Neste MY Renewable Diesel (= HVO 100) instead of fossil diesel.New fuel source supports Port of Dover decarbonisation effortsWhen the cranes were delivered, Karen Hayes, General Manager at Port of Dover Cargo, commented: “Since our new terminal in the Western Docks opened just over a year and a half ago, our business has flourished. We have continued to adapt to the latest technologies and techniques, enabling the team to process every range of cargo in the industry and expand our customer base even further.” The team at Dover is particularly pleased that the cranes are running on HVO, as this is supporting the Port’s drive towards achieving its recently announced industry-leading decarbonisation targets.Robert Alexander, Sales Manager at Liebherr-Great Britain, said: “It has been a pleasure working with the team at Port of Dover. We wish the port every success as they expand their operations, and we look forward to working with them in the future.”. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

5 things you may not have known about Bearing Clearance Monitoring,Listicle |10/18/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/5-things-you-may-not-have-known-about-bearing-clearance-monitoring.html?page=27,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr will present a digital wear measurement system for slewing bearings. Here are 5 facts about the Bearing Clearance Monitoring (BCM).Find out more",Listicle,10/18/2022,". Anyone who works with Liebherr machines knows how large slewing bearings are. The gigantic steel components enable, among other things, the rotation of cranes and uppercarriages. The Bearing Clearance Monitoring (BCM) digital wear measurement system allows these giants to be monitored remotely via an app. BCM is used, for example, in mining equipment and material handling technology or in maritime applications.. . When a construction machine is in daily use, highly stressed components are subject to wear. Naturally this wear has to be monitored. With many wear measurement methods, the monitoring is, of course, done manually. Service technicians mount dial gauges or other measuring devices directly on the slewing bearing. This is not always easy, because they also have to work in dangerous areas, for example under excavators. With the BCM system, the measuring devices are already permanently installed in the bearing. The measurement by the installed sensors is triggered via the app. Safety first.. . More than three hours can pass if a mining excavator is at a standstill due to manual wear measurement. But what does that mean? The mining excavator cannot load about 60 trucks during this time. So time and money are lost. The digital BCM system comes in handy here. Through its regular use, replacement intervals can be optimally planned and spare parts ordered accordingly. The measurements with the BCM system help to identify what the condition of a bearing is, whether it needs to be replaced or whether further measures are necessary to preserve the bearing. This way, downtimes can be greatly minimised since, with a measurement duration of 30 minutes, only 10 trucks cannot be loaded by the mining excavator.. . How does BCM work in the first place? It’s all about the combination of preicse technology and the optimal connection. The sensor connection box receives the data from the sensors attached to the slewing bearing and supplies power to the entire BCM system. This sensor data is stored in the gateway, i.e., the hardware used for the BCM, and updates for the BCM can also be installed there. The sensors then transmit the data to the app users.. . Not every location has an Internet connection. BCM can even be used autonomously in regions without a data connection. This is the case in mines, for example, because they often do not have the necessary reception. A direct connection via Bluetooth makes the measurement process possible from a safe distance and without a network connection.. Bearing Clearance Monitoring can be found at the Liebherr booth A326 in Hall A4.To the world of components at Bauma"
Liebherr further expands its axial piston portfolio and introduces a concept study,Press releases |10/17/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-further-expands-its-axial-piston-portfolio-and-introduces-a-concept-study.html?page=27,"At this year's Bauma, Liebherr is presenting two new product developments in the field of axial piston hydraulics, along with a concept study of a parallel pump with an innovative control system.Find out more",Press releases,10/17/2022,"Upon development of new hydraulic solutions, Liebherr focuses primarily on solution orientation and digitalisation, as well as the ever-growing challenges therein. The product portfolio of open circuit pumps will, therefore, be broadened by the nominal size of 550 and as a double pump by the nominal size of 1100 cm3, respectively. The LH30VO family will also be expanded by the nominal size of 100.. DPVO 550i – on the pulse of current affairs with new nominal sizes of open circuit pumpsThe mining and industrial sectors, as well as maritime applications place increasing demands on the availability and longevity of machines and technology. In order to keep up, the components product segment at the site in Bulle (Switzerland) is expanding its product portfolio of open circuit pumps by the nominal size of 550, which can also be used as a double pump of 1100 cm3. ""Like all pumps in this product family, the DPVO 550i is characterised by a particular robustness. In the view of digitalisation, this product is ready to incorporate various sensor technologies"", explains Guillaume Bonnetot, General Manager Systems at Liebherr-Mining Equipment Colmar SAS. ""We are looking forward to see Liebherr components in use on our own machines"".. LH30VO100 – the newest member of the pump familyModularity is the signature trait of the LH30VO family with nominal sizes of 28, 45 and 85. Liebherr is further pursuing this approach with the inclusion of the nominal size of 100 cm3. Among other things, the LH30VO100 consists of a modular system of eight controllers with a variety of combination options. The variable drive-through concept allows the selection and addition of further pumps, when installing them on the machine. In doing so, Liebherr-Components is fulfilling the growing demand for products with a high degree of flexibility. With all its nominal sizes, the entire LH30VO pump family offers a wide range of applications from mobile machinery and stationary hydraulics, for primary work functions to secondary applications, such as in fans, auxiliary drives or steering systems.. With a concept study on parallel pumps with innovative controls into the futureIn the concept study of a compact parallel pump with an electro-hydraulic control (Electro Hydraulic Control (EHC)), Liebherr merges mechanical features with electronics. In addition to the possibility of different gear ratios, this parallel pump offers an ideal solution for machines with conceptually different drive speeds. With the flexibility of a software-based electro-hydraulic control, it is able to provide the oil volume flow in an optimised, efficient and highly dynamic fashion. ""Accordingly, the concept creates a prerequisite for future application with condition monitoring of the component"", explains Albert Bertschi, Sales Manager at Liebherr Machines Bulle SA.With these additions to the product families and the presentation of the concept, Liebherr is up to par with current and future user requirements and takes an important step towards the digitalisation of its products.

5 things you may not have known about the 110 D-K crawler concrete pump,Listicle |10/17/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/5-things-you-may-not-have-known-about-the-110-d-k-crawler-concrete-pump.html?page=27,One of around 100 exhibits at Bauma 2022 is the crawler concrete pump 110 D-K. Here are 5 facts about the pump from the concrete technology product segment.Find out more,Listicle,10/17/2022,". There are construction sites for which you simply need a specialist. The 110 D-K crawler concrete pump is ideally suited for concrete pile foundations. During this work, deep holes are drilled in the ground for the preparation of the foundation soil, which are immediately filled with concrete. This makes the flexible pump the perfect partner for Liebherr deep foundation machines. In addition, the Liebherr crawler concrete pump can also be used for various other types of pumping applications.. . Teamwork can't get any better than this. The 110 D-K crawler concrete pump and the Liebherr piling and drilling rigs are digitally connected and communicate with each other on the construction site. The recurring processes of drilling, pulling and pumping concrete into the borehole are optimised. From their cab, the operator of the drilling rig can start and stop the pumping process to the second. This simplifies the work processes and saves time.. . A manoeuvrable Liebherr crawler concrete pump like this one can be flexibly positioned. When working on construction sites, it is often necessary to drive from A to B. Such frequent changes of location within the construction site are exactly the thing of the 110 D-K. In addition, the concrete pump mounted on a crawler chassis can be conveniently moved and operated via a radio remote control.. . The robust crawler concrete pump is available in two performance classes, the THS 110 D-K and the THS 140 D-K. The most powerful version can handle up to 135 m³ of concrete per hour, which equates to 900 bathtubs. Incidentally, these two strong performers are equipped with powerful six-cylinder engines. And despite their power, pumping units run quietly.. . Well thought-out design means not only a beautiful appearance, but also easy handling. On the 110 D-K, the hydraulic system has been developed with an open hydraulic circuit, making it easy to maintain. Wear parts are easy to replace. And the smooth surface not only looks great, it even makes cleaning easier. In particular, the shape of the feed hopper without edges or recesses reduces concrete residues and contamination..

6 historical pictures of Liebherr at Bauma that you have never seen before,Listicle |10/16/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/6-historical-pictures-of-liebherr-at-bauma-that-you-have-never-seen-before.html?page=27,Liebherr and Bauma – it's a success story. Liebherr has been a regular exhibitor at the trade show since the second Bauma in 1956. A lot has happened at Liebherr since then. We went searching in our Liebherr archive and found photos from every decade: They impressively show the development of the Liebherr booth.Find out more,Listicle,10/16/2022,". The Liebherr booth at Bauma 1958, which took place on the occasion of the 800th anniversary of the city of Munich, was still quite manageable. Nevertheless, there was a lot for visitors to discover at the old show grounds in the Theresienhöhe district. At that time, the construction industry in Germany was booming and more and more companies and new developments were conquering the market and the trade show was held annually. Liebherr exhibited tower cranes and construction machines, such as the L 300 excavator. For the first time, 13 exhibitors from abroad were also represented.. . The growth began: At Bauma 1962, the Liebherr booth took up considerably more space than in the early years of the trade show. But it wasn't just Liebherr that needed more space. The entire trade show had grown so much that it had moved from the old Messe München exhibition grounds to a larger space on a former airport site in Oberwiesenfeld. Meanwhile, 450 exhibitors were represented at Bauma.. . With a booth area of almost 4,800 m2, Liebherr had a lot to offer at the 17th Bauma in 1973. Back again in the Theresienwiese district, which today is world-famous thanks to the Oktoberfest. From 10 to 18 March, visitors could get to know the new crane models Form 32 K/45, Form 301 C and 90 HB. The new B 1 500 concrete mixing plant and the LG 1130 lattice boom truck-mounted crane were also highlights. The R 941 B excavator celebrated its world premiere. This Bauma was to be the last in the 2-year cycle. Due to the economic crisis at the time, the trade show was cancelled in 1975. Bauma was back in 1977 and has been held every three years since then.. . Bauma 1989 took place from 10 to 16 April 1989. There was great interest in the products of the 1,294 exhibitors and 239 additionally represented companies from 30 countries. Liebherr was not only represented with an impressive, yellow-striped booth, but also took new measures in the trade show communication. For the first time, visitors were able to take a look behind the scenes at Liebherr in the Liebherr-Bauma newspaper. The cover story was: Litronic ""All Out"" Electronics.. . In 1998, Bauma had grown so much that it would have burst at the seams at its old site. Therefore, it was held for the first time at the new exhibition grounds of Messe München in Munich Riem. The Liebherr booth had evolved into a large building with an impressive ceiling of glass and steel. Liebherr had 74 exhibits, of which 14 were world premieres, such as the Litronic cranes, the LTM 1500 mobile crane, LR 1400 crawler crane or the Compactmix 0.5. A total of 380,000 visitors attended the event, including trade visitors from 131 countries.. . For Bauma 2010, which took place from 19 to 25 April, Liebherr designed a completely new booth. One year later, it was even awarded the Red Dot Design Award 2011 in the category ""Communication Design"". This booth is still the heart of Liebherr at Bauma today. Among the exhibits were many premieres, including the 81K fast-erecting crane, the Betomix, the mobile crane LTC 1045 , the dump truck TA 230 and the mining excavator R 9100..

One of them is the LICCON3 crane control system. Here are 5 things worth knowing about the latest generation.Find out more,Listicle,10/15/2022,". When you stand in front of the new LTM 1110-5.2 for the first time at Bauma 2022, you might have to look twice. This is because the mobile crane has received a design update and is now equipped with a new driver's cab. And quite a few things have also changed from a technological perspective. But the real highlight is the new LICCON3 crane control system.. . The new crane control system has future-oriented power. Thanks to its completely new software and programming language as well as the faster data bus, significantly more memory and higher computer performance, the control system can be further developed more quickly in the future. This may be the case, for example, with complex applications such as VarioBase® which require high performance data.. . One thing was important in the development: Crane operators who already work with Liebherr cranes should quickly get to grips with the new control system. In this way, the new was combined with the tried and tested. The information on the displays has been revised and even simplified. At the same time, familiar features such as the BTT remote control terminal have remained. So anyone who has previously operated one of the LICCON2 cranes, will quickly find their way around.. . All LICCON3 cranes are prepared for telematics and fleet management as standard. Via the MyLiebherr customer portal, registered customers can view, monitor and evaluate all relevant data of their Liebherr mobile cranes - and even pass it on as an operational report if they wish.. . Today, it is impossible to imagine the world of Liebherr mobile cranes without the LICCON crane control system. But did you know that the Liebherr Group developed a modular, freely programmable control system for hydraulic functional units in mobile cranes as early as 1989? It was given the abbreviated name LICCON (Liebherr Computed Control). LICCON 2 followed in 2007. 2022 is the year of LICCON3..

5 things you may not have known about the LR 1400 SX crawler crane,Listicle |10/14/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/5-things-you-may-not-have-known-about-the-lr-1400-sx-crawler-crane.html?page=27,Liebherr will showcase around 100 exhibits and numerous innovations at Bauma 2022. We have selected some special exhibits that you should not miss during the trade show. Here are 5 exciting facts about the LR 1400 SX crawler crane. Would you have known everything?Find out more,Listicle,10/14/2022,". The LR 1400 SX is Liebherr's largest multi-purpose crawler crane and, with a height of 116 m, is the tallest exhibit at the Liebherr booth. The model is as tall as a football field is long and even towers over the Statue of Liberty in New York. And that's not even the maximum boom length: If that were the case, it could lift loads to the 170 m high OpernTurm in Frankfurt, Germany.. . For a long time, the LR 1300 with a lifting capacity of 300 t was the best-selling Liebherr crawler crane. But loads are getting heavier and change the requirements (in the market). ""Just build a bigger LR 1300,"" one customer suggested. We took him at his word. The result: The new LR 1400 SX: Its boom has a load capacity of 400 t. Or as one customer from the USA said, ""That's a big boom!"". . It may be a superlative crane, but transporting the LR 1400 SX is surprisingly easy. The heaviest part to be transported is the upper carriage. The undercarriage, the crawler tracks, the A-frame and the boom winch do not have to be disassembled. Even platforms and railings can be conveniently folded up and remain on the crane for transport.. . An auxiliary crane? The LR 1400 SX does not need one. Thanks to its self-assembly system, boom sections, central ballast, the tracks and hoisting winches can be easily assembled and disassembled. It can even lift, lower and secure the 150 t rear ballast hydraulically. The rear ballast can be modularly equipped with 5 or 10 t ballast plates depending on requirements.. . With its integrated radio remote control, the LR 1400 SX can also be operated outside the cab. This gives the crane operator a better and safer overview of the construction site. So-called ""blind spots"" can thus be better avoided. Depending on the application, there is also no need for a second person to assist the crane operator with hand signals during the lifting process..

"All-electric LS 800 E ship cranes for SAL ""Orca"" project",Press releases |10/12/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/all-electric-ls-800-e-ship-cranes-for-sal-orca-project.html?page=28,"SAL Heavy Lift orders eight all-electric heavy lift ship cranes type LS 800 E. As part of the future-oriented ""Orca"" project, two cranes will be installed on each of SAL's four vessel newbuildings. By combining the capacity of both cranes in tandem mode, cargoes of up to 1,600 tonnes can be handled. The innovative ship cranes will make it possible to lift components of the future project cargo while being prepared for the increasing environmental protection requirements.Find out more",Press releases,10/12/2022,"The LS 800 E is the latest innovation of Liebherr’s heavy lift ship crane portfolio. The recently launched crane is designed for the ever heavier and larger cargo. Moreover, the all-electric drive concept supports vessel operators in saving CO2 emissions. The order of the first LS 800 E ship cranes marks the beginning of a new phase in the long-term partnership between the Harren Group and Liebherr. At the same time, it is SAL Heavy Lift's first newbuilding project with Liebherr. The two family-run companies have been cooperating since the start of this new project for four multipurpose heavy lift vessels. The crane manufacturer was actively involved in the development from day 1. Since the ""Orca"" class of ship breaks new ground in many respects and will significantly raise the bar in the relevant transport segment, the crane developers were also challenged to rethink many details in addition to general requirements, and performance parameters and to make their contribution to the efficiency and innovation of the ship concept. The result is a perfectly coordinated unit of crane and vessel that enables maximum efficiency and performance.All-electric energy efficiencyApart from fulfilling the demanding operational requirements and different cargo scenarios, the new Liebherr Ship Cranes enable significant savings in smart interaction with the innovations on the ship side. The new LS 800 E actively communicates with the ship's power management system and thus enables intelligent energy utilisation. Recovered energy is fed back into the ship's energy system and stored so that it can be released when energy consumption is high again. This leads to a noticeably reduced fuel consumption and a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions on the ""ORCA"" ships. The entire power electronics of the drive system are installed inside the cranes. This allows the limited space below deck to be used for other purposes and noticeable facilitates the integration of the crane into the ship's design.. Compact design for high durabilityThe integration of the entire drive concept inside the crane also significantly increases the durability of the components, as they are protected from the weather. ""The reliability of the cranes is extremely important for heavy lift vessels. They must function for the entire life of the vessel. The family-run company Liebherr offers a convincing overall package for this, thanks to its wide-ranging product and technology knowledge as well as its worldwide service network”, explains Dr Martin Harren, CEO of the Harren Group.Ready for future requirementsThe LS 800 E ship cranes expand Liebherr's product portfolio and enter a new segment. They are the largest ship cranes Liebherr has built to date. The cranes are aimed for a growing market of shipping large wind industry components. In the future, these will not be manageable with the lifting capacities and dimensions that have been common in the market so far. Moreover, the supply of heavy lift vessels with cranes of 800 tonnes capacity is lower than the expected future demand. Liebherr has claimed the resulting growth market for itself with the development of the LS 800 E ship crane.The all-electric drives are already preparing the cranes for future environmental protection requirements in terms of energy efficiency an emissions regulation. ""The development of the new cranes combines SAL's user experience and Liebherr's crane construction expertise. The LS 800 E will be the most advanced ship crane in its segment”, comments Gregor Levold, General Manager Sales for Liebherr Offshore, Ship and Port Cranes. ""The all-electric heavy lift cranes feature a variety of innovations that simplify maintenance and reduce operating costs. At the same time, they are characterised by innovative as well as environmentally friendly drive technology”, adds Levold.Cooperation with historyThe cooperation between Liebherr and the Bremer Harren Group began back in the late 1990s with the delivery of the first 40-tonne ship cranes for container vessels. This was followed by a large order for 24 Liebherr heavy lift cranes for use on multipurpose vessels in 2006 and 2007. Since then, a trusting partnership has developed between the two companies on an equal footing, which was further expanded in the transport sector with Harren's acquisition of SAL Heavy Lift. Dr Martin Harren comments as follows: ""The cooperation between SAL and Liebherr is characterised by great commitment and mutual trust.""

Liebherr hydraulic cylinders: just a mouse click away,Press releases |10/12/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-hydraulic-cylinders-just-a-mouse-click-away.html?page=28,"For the first time, Liebherr has made it possible to individually and easily configure all hydraulic cylinder series via an online-based configurator on the company’s website. Depending on the application and requirements, the configurator offers all kinds of variations: from the 380 bar series for mobile applications, the ISO 6022 series for industrial use all the way to the 260 bar series as a link between mobile and stationary applications. While the tool will already be available a couple of weeks before Bauma 2022, its detailed presentation to the public will take place for the first time at the show.Find out more",Press releases,10/12/2022,"The Liebherr-Components’ site in Kirchdorf an der Iller (Germany) has been working specifically on the development and construction of standardised series for quite some time. In doing so, Liebherr experts offer a versatile selection of easily combinable and modular solutions for a wide range of applications. A milestone is the digitalisation of options and features in the form of an online configurator.Smart solutions for the right productLiebherr-Components Kirchdorf GmbH makes dedicated use of digitisation options to support technicians, buyers and product managers who are specifically looking for a product and need a quick solution. ""When it comes to selecting and assembling the right product, the configurator offers assistance through stored logic and targeted user guidance,"" explains Jan Winter, product manager at Liebherr-Components Kirchdorf GmbH. A corresponding 3D simulation provides the user with an up-to-date visual representation of the result. Should the requirement lie outside the range of the construction series, corresponding options are stored in order to be able to make a special inquiry.The product configuration is completely anonymous: By means of a self-generating product key, each variation receives its individual ""code"", which can simply be copied and used for recall. Those who wish to process their configurations further, are able to manage the results in the personal login area, send an inquiry or receive further information about the product. In addition to a clear data sheet, 3D models of the individually configured cylinder can be downloaded immediately to allow the hydraulic cylinder be installed directly in the customer's application.Available at any time - no matter where and when The configurator is currently available in two languages, German and English, and can be accessed anywhere and at any time via the Liebherr website.

Liebherr: Technology-neutral drive concepts for the future,News |10/11/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-technology-neutral-drive-concepts-for-the-future.html?page=28,"What is the drive technology of the future? Which one will save the most emissions? And is there even one single silver bullet? In fact, there are various technological options for reducing pollutant emissions, which are researched by Liebherr. In its technology-neutral approach, the company takes into account both environmental and the most diverse customer requirements in equal measure, in order to be able to serve different markets and industries. The Liebherr Group presents some of its solutions at this year’s Bauma in Munich.Find out more",News,10/11/2022,"The Liebherr Group focuses on the energy carriers available today and in the foreseeable future, as well as their associated low carbon power train solutions – i.e. combustion engines, fuel cell power trains, energy storage systems, power electronics and electric drives. The energy carriers include electrical energy, hydrogen, ammonia, e-fuels, methanol, hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), biodiesel and fossil diesel. Liebherr intentionally pursues an approach that is neutral to all technologies, since the choice of the most practical and possibly emission-free solution depends on multiple factors. These include the size, the degree of mobility, the duty cycle of the machine, its use and the available infrastructure to name but a few. Liebherr provides the respective drive train specifically for the application and in accordance with customer needs.. The combustion engine – ready for conventional and alternative fuelsThe internal combustion engine (ICE) has been powering a wide variety of stationary and mobile applications since the 19th century. In four steps or cycles, it converts chemical energy into mechanical work by burning a fuel inside its combustion chamber. This technology is particularly suitable for industries and applications requesting high power density, flexibility, reliability, and easy serviceability, in addition to working in harsh environments like earthmoving, construction and mining.However, when running with diesel, internal combustion engines emit greenhouse gases. These can be reduced, compensated or even avoided e.g. by replacing diesel with renewable fuels produced from sustainable energy sources – provided that they are readily available on the construction site and that the power train can offer a similar power density as the diesel version. The wide range of applications served by diesel-powered machinery today makes it highly probable that there will not be one single alternative fuel that will replace diesel in the future.When studying the use of various alternative fuels, the Group’s Swiss and French centres of excellence for engine development, Liebherr Machines Bulle SA and Liebherr-Components Colmar, are following a technology-neutral approach. As a first step, both companies already started using biofuels a few years ago, which was closely followed last year by the release of HVO, enabling a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90 %. Moreover, synthetic fuels based on renewable energy sources can already save up to 100% CO2. “Today, our customers’ existing fleets are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines. They can refuel their machines with HVO or, in the future, with e-fuels, and thus save emissions without having to replace their fleet,” explains Ulrich Weiss, Managing Director for Research and Development of Combustion Engines at Liebherr Machines Bulle SA.Liebherr currently develops hydrogen injection systems, as well as complete hydrogen combustion engines, which are planned to be ready for serial production starting from 2025. A demonstration model, the H966, will be presented at Bauma 2022 as part of the R 9XX H2 crawler excavator. Other fuels, such as ammonia and methanol, are seen as promising, given their higher energy density and carbon neutrality as compared to H2. In future, the experience gained from the development and field trials of the hydrogen engine will bring significant benefits to the further development of engines based on specific alternative fuels, or a combination of fuels.. The fuel cell – hydrogen for the electric motorHydrogen does not only play a role in combustion engines but is also used for fuel cells. The fuel cell itself contains two electrode plates made of carbon or metal. The plates are coated with a precious metal that serves as a catalyst. Between the electrode plates is an ion conductor, such as ceramic, alkali or acid. Oxygen and fuel – e.g. hydrogen – are continuously supplied via the electrodes. These react with each other, producing water, heat and electricity. This energy is stored and then used to power the electric motors and devices in the machine. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells operate without emissions and come with a higher degree of technical maturity than hydrogen combustion engines. However, such fuel cells have not yet been sufficiently tested for use in construction machinery operating under very demanding environmental conditions.Since the early 2000’s, Liebherr has been cooperating with major automotive manufacturers to use motorised compressors, including the dedicated power electronics, to provide clean compressed air to the vehicle fuel cell stacks. Liebherr develops this technology e.g. for commercial and construction vehicles, heavy-duty railway vehicles or aerospace applications.The e-drive – on the road with and without cableA fully-electric powertrain draws its energy from the grid or from energy and power storage, for example, a battery. Mains-powered machines, such as the new crawler excavator R 976-E, are constantly supplied with electricity via a cable. Such machines can be operated in a climate-neutral manner, if the electricity required is generated from renewable energy sources. However, they reach their limits when machines exceed their operating radius or high mains power is required at short notice.To enable the energy supply of mobile machines on construction sites with limited or no mains supply, Liebherr develops mobile energy storage systems. These include, for example, the Liduro Power Port. From 2024, the energy storage system will be available in serial production. It will supply machines on construction sites with the required power, charge them during breaks and compensate for peak loads. The energy storage system can be transported as a mobile complete system to construction sites located in urban areas and peripheries. There, it can supplement grid connections or be used autonomously as an island network. At Bauma, the Liduro Power Port will supply power to the LTC and MK mobile cranes as a functional demonstrator.. Challenges for the futureLiebherr has always attached importance to a high degree of vertical integration while concentrating on core processes. For the components product segment, which covers the entire drive train, the technological changes, therefore, have various implications: “On the one hand, we have a broad product portfolio in the Liebherr Group. From the beginning, it has included not only electrically driven machines, but also machines that can be converted relatively quickly to alternative drives. On the other hand, we are also dealing with operating conditions and areas, in which it is currently still very difficult to replace the combustion engine,” explains Gebhard Schwarz, Managing Director for Development and Production at Liebherr-Component Technolgies AG.His colleague Pietro Iemmi, Managing Director for Sales and Customer Service, adds: “Despite certain indicators, it is difficult to predict exactly, which future technologies will be needed for the machines of tomorrow. For us, as for many other companies, this means understanding the new developments and pushing them in different directions. We see it as our responsibility to develop the necessary technical expertise and bring technologies to market to help our customers design their machines in the best possible way.""The Liebherr Group will be exhibiting some of those drive solutions and their applications at this year’s Bauma in Munich: for example, the electric version of the LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane, which delivers full power electrically or conventionally; the ETM 1205 T and ETM 905 hybrid electric truck mixers; the unplugged versions of the LB 30 and LRH 200 deep foundation machines; the MK 140 5.1 mobile construction crane, which has no emissions in electric construction site operation; the Liduro Power Port or the H966 hydrogen engine, which is presented for the first time in conjunction with a construction machine, the R 9XX H2 crawler excavator..

Liebherr to premiere its hydrogen prototype engines at Bauma 2022,Press releases |10/10/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-to-premiere-its-hydrogen-prototype-engines-at-bauma-2022.html?page=28,"At Bauma 2022, the Liebherr components product segment is introducing two prototypes of its hydrogen engine for tomorrow’s construction sites. Each prototype employs different hydrogen injection technologies, a direct injection (DI) and a port fuel injection (PFI).Find out more",Press releases,10/10/2022,"In the future, combustion engines will no longer be powered solely by fossil diesel. In order to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, fuels from sustainable energy sources will have to be used. Green hydrogen is one of them, since it is a promising carbon-free fuel, which does not cause any CO2 emissions whilst burning inside the internal combustion engine (ICE). Liebherr’s expertise in the development of ICEs will furthermore facilitate a quick introduction of hydrogen technologies to the market.Hydrogen engines: a promising futureThe Liebherr components product segment has recently made a significant investment into the development of its hydrogen engine and test facilities. Prototype engines have been tested since 2020. Meanwhile, the prototypes have shown encouraging results in terms of performance and emissions, both on test benches and in the field. Different injection and combustion technologies, such as port fuel injection (PFI) and direct injection (DI), have also been assessed in the process. The first prototype construction machines equipped with these engines have been running since 2021.PFI technology: a starting point in the developmentInitial efforts in the development of a hydrogen engine have considered PFI as a first suitable technology. The first machine running with a 100% hydrogen-fuelled ICE is the Liebherr R 9XX H2 crawler excavator. In it, the zero-emission 6-cylinder engine H966 fulfils the specific requirements in terms of power and dynamics. The R 9XX H2 with the H966 engine in its port fuel injection configurationwill be on display at booth 809 – 810 and 812 – 813. Up close, the H966 will be presented there in the InnoLab.. DI: a step towards efficient hydrogen enginesEncouraged by the results achieved with the PFI technology, Liebherr further pursues its research and development activities in the field of DI. The 4-cylinder engine prototype H964 exhibited at the components’ booth 326 in hall A4 is equipped with said technology. In this case, hydrogen is injected directly into the combustion chamber, whereas with the PFI solution it is blown into the air intake port. The DI offers increased potential in terms of combustion efficiency and power density, which makes hydrogen engines an attractive alternative to diesel engines when it comes to more demanding applications.What is next to come?The components segment expects to kick off series production of hydrogen engines by 2025. In the meantime, the company sets forth its research activities in fuel injection to further optimise combustion and to ensure maximum power density.In addition to 100% hydrogen-fuelled engines, several research endeavours in the area of alternative fuels are currently in progress. One example is a dual fuel engine that can run on hydrogen ignited by HVO injection or fully on HVO. This technology will allow for more flexibility in vehicle operation with different configurations.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr-made grease for pitch and azimuth bearings,Press releases |10/07/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-made-grease-for-pitch-and-azimuth-bearings.html?page=28,"Liebherr has developed a lubricant, Duro Wind PBG (durable pitch bearing grease), for use in pitch and azimuth bearings of wind turbines. The grease ensures very low wear, and thus longer bearing life. Moreover, this effective lubrication shows outstanding results in terms of corrosion protection, be it moisture corrosion or false brinelling. Duro Wind PBG also impresses with its excellent characteristics at low temperatures.Find out more",Press releases,10/07/2022,"As smoothly as it runs, efficient lubrication by means of Duro Wind PBG provides maximum support for pitch bearings. The low to non-existent rotations in alternating directions and the extreme loads imposed by the rotor blades prove to be very demanding for pitch bearings. By optimally matching sliding and mixed friction, Duro Wind PBG significantly improves the lubrication properties of pitch and azimuth bearings. As a high?performance grease for the initial and relubrication of pitch bearings, Duro Wind PBG also contributes to a longer service life of a wind turbine.Testing makes the difference""Rolling bearing failures often prove to be the result of inadequate lubrication,"" explains Andreas Palmer, head of department for the development and design of slewing bearings at Liebherr Components in Biberach (Germany). ""Here, it is not only a matter of sufficient, clean lubricants, but also of choosing the right lubricant for each particular application,"" says Palmer. Therefore, Liebherr has tested fourteen different greases, including Duro Wind PBG. The focus thereby was primarily on wear protection, low-temperature properties and the tendency to false brinelling, a wear phenomenon in rolling bearings that occurs during oscillating movements at small pitch angles. The results showed considerable differences between the individual lubricants. Above all, the test series made it obvious that not only the optimum design, but also the combination with the right lubricant – Duro Wind PBG – was decisive for the best possible service life of the pitch bearings. Thus, when using Duro Wind PBG, there are no restrictions for pitch and azimuth bearings with IPC (individual pitch control) due to excellent surface protection against false brinelling and moisture corrosion.. Special greases. For special slewing bearings. From specialists.It is known that every application has special requirements, which have to be met. Upon developing the Duro Wind PBG, the Liebherr-Components team relied on its long-term track record, extensive expertise and user experience in the fields of slewing bearings, lubricants and seals. ""The interaction between the bearing design, sealing and lubrication proves to be crucial,"" concludes Palmer. ""Lubrication as a design element determines the optimum extended service life of slewing bearings. Since they have to endure very high loads, appropriate lubrication is key for them."" The Duro Wind PBG is already available worldwide and can be stored for up to three years. Liebherr grants an additional year of warranty for grease users..

360° for 100% comfort: Liebherr surround view system for mobile machines,Press releases |09/29/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/360-degrees-for-100-percent-comfort-liebherr-surround-view-system-for-mobile-machines.html?page=29,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr's components product segment will be introducing LiXplore®, its new range of digital camera-monitor system. Depending on their needs, users can choose between different versions and intelligent additional functions. The proven components - the digital smart camera MDC3 and display controller DC5 – DC5 ensure the robustness and quality of the entire system.Find out more",Press releases,09/29/2022,"The permanent and precise monitoring of work processes and routes is a challenge for the operators of mobile machines. Whether construction equipment, agricultural machinery or forklifts, blind spots due to the size of the machine, as well as obstacles in the field of vision impair the view from the cab. Demanding environmental conditions, such as vibration, strong temperature fluctuations and humidity add to the difficulty.Camera-monitor systems are an ideal solution, when it comes to monitoring work processes at several operating sites simultaneously. They can display multiple views on one single monitor, for example the rear and boom of a harvesting machine. The advantage of digital camera technology over the analogue one is image quality and sharpness. High-resolution cameras by Liebherr provide detailed images and result in more efficiency and comfort for the operator.""For more than ten years, we have been producing digital Ethernet cameras and displays for mobile machinery. We are now merging our experience and expertise into the LiXplore® product line,"" says Alexander Bertsch, Head of the Sensor Product Line at Liebherr-Elektronik GmbH in Lindau (Germany). Liebherr’s camera-monitor systems offer a high degree of flexibility. From the number of digital cameras, the field of view angles to the size of the display - users can put together their system according to their requirements.360° variant as an intelligent assistance systemThe 360° variant LiXplore® Bird's Eye variant offers operators a complete surround view of their machine's working environment. The system seamlessly merges the images from four mounted cameras into one single bird's-eye view. Compared to conventional, mostly analogue, surround view solutions that require an additional electronic control unit (ECU), the system is thus simple in design and economically wired.In addition to the the classical bird's eye view, the system allows users to define detailed views and overlays according to their requirements and to assign the corresponding function keys to the display. Operators can switch between views quickly and intuitively at the touch of a button.Simple and time-saving calibration Prior to operation, users first have to adjust or calibrate their surround view system - a time-consuming task that should not be underestimated, especially with a large fleet of machines. When developing Bird's Eye, Liebherr's components product segment, therefore, attached great importance to a simple system that can be calibrated within a few minutes. The calibration mats do not have to be precisely placed, nor do the distances to other objects have to be measured. Bird's Eye is thus ideal for anyone, who wants to save time and money with a streamlined commissioning process.MDC3 digital smart camera: the heart of the systemFor the LiXplore product series, Liebherr relies on the high-performance MDC3 camera. The HDR functionality continuously ensures high-contrast images without overexposure or underexposure, even in very dark working environments and in volatile light conditions from bright to dark. The highly robust cameras are based on years of experience derived from operation in challenging industries, such as construction or agricultural machinery.Liebherr will present the new range of camera-monitor systems from 24 to 30 October at Bauma 2022 in Munich (hall A4, booth 326)..

Liebherr presents new LH 26 M Timber Litronic timber truck,Press releases |09/29/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-presents-new-lh-26-m-timber-litronic-timber-truck.html?page=29,"Liebherr presents the LH 26 M Timber Litronic, a new special machine for efficient timber handling. Thanks to its extremely compact design and exceptional manoeuvrability, the LH 26 M Timber is predestined for work in sawmills and timber operations with limited space. The handling machine impresses with extremely low fuel consumption and maximum performance at the same time.Find out more",Press releases,09/29/2022,"Whether as fuel, construction element or piece of furniture: wood is a climate-friendly and popular all-rounder. For efficient timber handling, Liebherr offers a wide portfolio of powerful and efficient special machines that are ideally suited for typical work processes such as loading and unloading trucks and trailers, sorting logs or transport. For these activities, good driving performance, high payloads as well as fast working cycles are particularly in demand. With the LH 26 M Timber Litronic, Liebherr is presenting a new timber truck that extends the existing portfolio downwards with an operating weight of between 23,500 and 26,000 kg.Machine combines high driving performance, compact dimensions and manoeuvrabilityThe engine power of 125 kW provides the system with a high torque. This means that the machine can be accelerated quickly. In combination with the high pump flow rate, fast and dynamic working movements and thus the highest handling performance are guaranteed.Thanks to its compact design, the machine is ideally suited for use especially in confined spaces. Due to the extremely small front and rear swing radius, the machine can be completely swivelled even in tight locations. The minimal contour of the right front in particular means that work can be carried out very close to the sorting string or pile, as this is always within the width of the undercarriage. This provides an excellent view of the working area, ensures additional safety and prevents collisions.For high manoeuvrability, the LH 26 M Timber is equipped with all-wheel steering as standard. The all-wheel steering increases driving stability and thus improves directional stability. The automatic steering reversal, which is also standard, guarantees the correct steering direction at all times when driving forwards or backwards.Optimised undercarriage concept and efficient driving operation for trailer operationThe electric swing angle adjustment in the traction motor provides more torque, maximum acceleration and higher tractive effort. This ensures a constantly high driving performance even on slopes. The optimal adjustment of speed and flow rate ensures convincing fuel efficiency even at maximum speed.For longer distances, the combination of timber tractor and trailer is the optimal choice. Thanks to the powerful drive and the robust axles, trailers weighing up to 60 tonnes can be towed. The new undercarriage concept with 2-point blade support significantly increases the handling performance in trailer operation. The 2-point blade support guarantees maximum stability as well as high payloads when loading and unloading the trailer over the entire swivel range. This allows more timber to be handled per loading cycle and thus increases productivity. The blade can additionally be used for clearing work and thus increases safety in the timber yard..

HLC 295000: Swift and capable,Press releases |09/28/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/hlc-295000-swift-and-capable.html?page=29,"With the installation of the largest monopiles ever produced in Europe and the lifting of a substation platform, the heavy lift crane HLC 295000 has successfully completed its first two offshore missions in the wind energy sector. The jobs took place at the german wind farm Arcadis Ost 1 and the french wind farm Fécamp.Find out more",Press releases,09/28/2022,"With the offshore crane HLC 295000 and its modern technologies, the Orion is currently considered the most innovative vessel in the offshore wind industry. Now ship and crane have successfully completed its first missions.In mid-August, the Orion first set down the 1,300-tonne jacket foundation on the prepared seabed with its HLC 295000 for the French offshore wind farm Fécamp. Then a 2,200-tonne transformer platform was successfully installed on the foundation. It was particularly important not to lose sight of the tight schedule and the weather conditions in Normandy, which was achieved not least thanks to the good dynamic positional (DP) system of the Orion and the high precision in the control of the HLC 295000.Monopile installation in record time Only a few weeks earlier, the offshore insatallation vessel and its Liebherr heavy lift crane crane were able to demonstrate their flexibility and performance in the wind energy sector for the first time. At the Arcadis Ost 1 wind farm in the German Baltic Sea, the HLC 295000 was used to install 28 monopile foundations. There, monopiles with lengths of up to 110 metres and a weight of up to 2,100 tonnes had to be moved and positioned for installation in the seabed. The innovation of the Orion is the ability to install the monopiles floating. This means that no time-consuming jack-up process of the ship out of the water is necessary, as it has been the case up to now with so-called jack-up units. Right from the start, it became evident how reliable and powerful the HLC 295000 is. It was often in use for 24 hours continuously.""We are very proud of this lighthouse project and look forward to seeing the HLC 295000 in action. Our initial experience indicates that the installation times of previous vessels of about 3 to 3.5 days per monopile can be significantly reduced to about 0.9 to 1 day per monopile with the use of the Orion and our HLC"", says Robert Pitschmann, Global Application Manager, Liebherr-MCCtec Rostock GmbH.. Engagement at both ends of the energy transitionWith a maximum lifting capacity of up to 5,000 tonnes and a maximum lifting height of 175 metres above deck, the HLC 295000 is the largest offshore crane Liebherr has ever manufactured. The HLC series and the expansion of the heavy-duty crane range are firmly anchored in Liebherr's strategy, not least because of the energy transition. In order to ensure a sustainable energy supply for present and future generations, significantly more and larger offshore wind turbines are being built. For the construction of these modern wind turbines, the lifting height of the HLC 295000 is a decisive factor. In addition, there is a trend towards decommissioning disused offshore oil and gas platforms. This involves dismantling large and heavy parts on the open sea - an important task for Liebherr's new HLC series, which it can handle thanks to its lifting capacities. By dismantling the old and building up the new energy, the HLC series can promote the energy transition ""at both ends of development"" for a more sustainable future..

Where steel ends: Clear the stage for Liebherr’s hybrid solutions in lightweight construction,Press releases |09/28/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/where-steel-ends-clear-the-stage-for-liebherr%E2%80%99s-hybrid-solutions-in-lightweight-construction.html?page=29,"Lightweight construction is considered an important trend and driver not only in construction machinery, but also all the way to stationary applications. If using suitable components can save weight, a significant benefit is generated for the application and the daily use of any equipment. Hybrid cylinders by Liebherr make a valuable contribution to it, since they are classic components made of steel in a CRP wrapping. At Bauma 2022, Liebherr will exhibit a hybrid cylinder and provide insights into further competencies and development opportunities in the fibre composite sector. In addition, the online configurator for hydraulic cylinder series will be presented, in which the hybrid cylinders within the 380 bar series-production range are also available.Find out more",Press releases,09/28/2022,"Liebherr's components product segment initially introduced its work in the field of fibre composites at Bauma 2019. In the meantime, the Components site in Kirchdorf an der Iller (Germany) has not only gathered further expertise and expanded its production capabilities, but has also worked on transferring this technology into its established hydraulics portfolio . One major result of this are the so-called hybrid cylinders, which are part of the product range in the fibre composite area. Even today, following preliminary development and targeted design, all classic hydraulic cylinders can be wrapped with CRP. In some application areas, solutions are even possible without an extensive development effort. The hybrid cylinder variant is integrated as a standard in the 380 bar series and is available as a separate option.Why hybrid cylinders?Many years of experience in the development and production of hydraulic cylinders and expertise in the field of fibre composites are optimal prerequisites for a goal-oriented combination. If weight plays a crucial role in the given application (for example, due to road approvals), hybrid cylinders are the right choice. Here, easy interchangeability of existing Liebherr hydraulic cylinders is possible. When specifically designing a hybrid component to save weight, the positive characteristics of fibre composites, such as stiffness, strength and density, become an advantage.Achieve the full potential with the right componentThe effect of using a lightweight component, such as a hybrid cylinder, varies depending on the application. Weight savings can increase operating speeds, enlarge attachments and booms and raise payloads. In addition, emissions and fuel consumption are reduced. The basis for the required improvement is the cooperation with customers. The Liebherr team accompanies them from the development of the solution-oriented product to delivery and far beyond. This is crucial with fibre composites, because the structure and individual DNA of the product are what counts in achieving the desired results.Further steps in the scope of developmentThe company has already achieved noteworthy results, for example in field test trials in the mining sector. Liebherr can transfer this knowledge to other applications and further expand it. The goal is not a hybrid cylinder but a full-fledged CRP one. Although there are still a number of steps to be taken before this can be achieved, Liebherr already works on merging concepts between steel and fibre composite parts, for example, and tests the results. The implementation of CRP conversions in conjunction with steel components are applicable to other products in the portfolio. In the future, for example, piston accumulators can be wound from CRP. Here, too, complete CRP solutions are possible and are being systematically tested.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Concrete mixing plant as a modular system: With modular solutions on the construction site,Press releases |09/27/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/concrete-mixing-plant-as-a-modular-system-with-modular-solutions-on-the-construction-site.html?page=29,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr presents the new generation of concrete mixing plants, which replaces several predecessor series at once. Jürgen Forster, production manager for mixing plants, and Henrik Utoft, Team leader loading and shipping, explain the advantages and functionality of the new modular concrete mixing plant in this interview.Find out more",Press releases,09/27/2022,"Mr. Forster, the new plant platform is technically and conceptually different from the predecessor model. What are the specific new developments?Forster: “The new plant platform will replace several series at the beginning of next year. Our development focused on a modular design. This means that individual modules such as the mixer or scale module, but also the feeder module, can be planned, manufactured and combined with other modules or independently of each other. Several versions can be realised by choosing the appropriate support frame: Steel foundation for gravel foundation, steel foundation with a high degree of preassembly for an assembly optimisation on the construction site or the classic anchoring parts for the construction site assembly. The customer benefits from shorter delivery times, faster assembly and high parts availability. The customer is also more flexible in the configuration of the system.”Utoft: “This modular system also has a number of advantages from a logistical point of view: Due to significantly more preassembled parts, fewer parts have to be manually packed and shipped. Another advantage is that we always have the same basic dimensions due to the modular design. This makes the planning of the vehicles easier.”. Impressive. This begs the question: Why did you make these innovations? Were there specific customer requirements?Forster: “For us it was a mixture of customer requirements as well as our striving for optimisation and technical innovation of the system. With the innovation, we have reacted to the changed market situation. In particular, the rising costs and logistical challenges that require efficient and high-performance material supply and production played a role. On the other hand, we are responding even more explicitly to the wishes of our customers: Depending on the application, different mixer systems can now be installed with the same basic system.”. One technical innovation that immediately catches the eye of experts is the so-called ring-pan mixer with variable agitator speed. Could you briefly explain to laymen the principle and the development idea behind it?Forster: “The ring-pan mixer is characterised by high mixing quality and high efficiency due to the agitator systems. With this ring-pan mixer, two powerful drives allow infinitely variable control of the main speed as well as the whirler speed. This creates the prerequisite for efficient and highly variable production of a wide variety of concrete types. Even highly complex concrete formulations for the precast industry are no problem with this mixer.”. With the help of a specific example: What advantages does the new series offer in a real-life application?Utoft: “The modular design already plays a decisive role when setting up the new Betomix. The feeder lift is a concrete example: This can simply be “attached” to the respective concrete mixing plant, regardless of the plant output. Due to the vertical installation, up to 20 % less space is required for the entire plant.”Forster: “In addition, the built-in frequency converter ensures more energy and resource efficiency. This offers the potential to reduce energy consumption by up to 30 %. With regard to the resource “cement”, the frequency converter works with an accuracy of +/- 0.5 %. To put it in concrete figures: for a typical recipe with 300 kg of cement per cubic metre of concrete, up to 7.5 kg of cement can be saved.”Liebherr has already presented the plant platform at the Bauma media dialogue on 21 June 2022. How much development time did the innovations take and are there already first customers interested in the new concrete mixing plant?Forster: “It took about two years from the first idea to the operational prototype. Currently, some projects are in the final phase, so that we expect the first orders by Bauma.”. .

Liebherr crane on the hook,Press releases |09/27/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-crane-on-the-hook.html?page=29,"The Eisele AG – Crane & Engineering Group based in Maintal in Hesse was looking for a Liebherr LTM 1750-9.1 mobile crane to help install 30-tonne concrete girders in a new sports hall in Wiesbaden. The job required a radius of almost 60 metres. But with no suitable mobile crane available, the resourceful Hessians came up with a clever solution.Find out more",Press releases,09/27/2022,"The order books in the crane industry in Germany are currently full to bursting. Mobile and crawler cranes are experiencing huge demand – a fact that caused some problems for the specialists at Eisele AG this summer. The company had been looking for a large mobile crane in the 750-tonne class for an important project. Mighty trusses needed to be placed as part of the construction of a new gymnasium, in some cases at extreme distances. ""Clearly a job for an LTM 1750-9.1,"" explained Tino Perschmann, a member of the external technical team at Eisele. ""But despite searching far and wide, we simply couldn't find an available crane of this type."" The solution was finally found within the company's own fleet of vehicles. The plan was to use Eisele's largest mobile crane, an LTM 1500-8.1, to lift a small 130-tonne mobile crane into the construction site, which would then directly install the trusses located furthest from the 500-tonne machine.. Sloping road – complex crane support The plan was soon put into action. However, certain other requirements on the construction site also proved challenging. Under extremely cramped conditions, it was necessary to erect the LTM 1500-8.1 on the road running along the site, which had a steep gradient of almost ten per cent. For this purpose, after the initial lifting via the support cylinders, the crane's axles were moved all the way up and the tyres underpinned with heavy Bongossi timbers up to 60 centimetres high. With the crane placed on top, the outriggers could be retracted and further underpinned to achieve the final outrigger height. When the undercarriage was positioned horizontally, the driver's cab was high in the air and could only be reached via a ladder.. After attaching the 28-metre luffing lattice jib to the telescopic boom on the 500-tonne crane, the work could begin. The plan worked. First, the four concrete trusses were lifted into the site for installation by the smaller crane. Attached to the support spars, the LTM 1130-5.1 itself was then hoisted over the approximately eight-metre-high wall into the future sports hall. There, the powerful 5-axle crane grabbed the trusses, which were over twenty metres long, and finally positioned the four components. Back out of the hall it went again at the hook of the LTM 1500-8.1. Then the 500-tonner finished the job by installing the remaining floor trusses.. The eight-year-old LTM 1500-8.1 is currently the most powerful lifting unit in Eisele AG's fleet of around 30 cranes, including mobile construction cranes from Liebherr. The crane and heavy load company based in the greater Frankfurt area was taken over by the Hüffermann Group last year. As a full-range supplier in the field of cranes, heavy lifting and engineering, the group, based in Wildeshausen in Lower Saxony, now has over 200 mobile cranes as well as crawler cranes with lifting capacities of up to 1,000 tonnes. In addition to Eisele AG, the companies Hüffermann Krandienst GmbH, Autodienst West Ganske GmbH (Maintal / Frankfurt) and the Thömen Group with its headquarters in Hamburg and branches in Brunsbüttel, Potsdam and Leipzig, which used to operate independently, are now also under the umbrella of the Hüffermann Group, which has over 500 employees in total..

"Two experts, one product: Drive technology and digitalization around the LR 1700-1.0",Press releases |09/23/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/two-experts-one-product-drive-technology-and-digitalization-around-the-lr-1700-1.0.html?page=30,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr is presenting the LR 1700-1.0 crawler crane. It follows on from the LR 1600/2. Wolfgang Boos, product manager for digital products, and Philipp Federle, head of the undercarriage design department, talk about alternative drive technologies and digital tools.Find out more",Press releases,09/23/2022,"Mr Boos, how does a customer from the wind industry know whether the LR 1700-1.0 or another crane type is better suited to their purposes?Boos: “Liebherr offers a whole range of tools that support crane operators or dispatchers in carrying out the upcoming lift as efficiently, simply and quickly as possible. A key element of this is the Crane Finder, which can be accessed via our MyLiebherr customer portal. The tool calculates for the customer which crane is suitable for the upcoming lift.The Crane Finder is optimised for all output devices: For use on the PC or directly on the smartphone or tablet on the construction site. This means that the crane operator can use the tool to find out directly on site how to set up the crane and which telescopic path to select.”And how does the Crane Finder actually work?Boos: “When developing the Crane Finder, we attached great importance to easy handling: First the user enters height, load and outreach. The Crane Finder then shows which crane models in which configuration are suitable for this lift – from the smallest possible to the largest model. If the user selects a crane from the list, he receives further useful information about the lift – such as the optimal telescoping path, which saves crane operators a lot of time.”. The LR 1700-1.0 not only combines economical transport and high performance. The undercarriage of the crane has a Liebherr diesel engine as standard, which can be fuelled with HVO as well as fossil fuels. What are the advantages of this, Mr Federle?Federle: “HVO, i.e. hydrogenated vegetable oil, has significantly lower CO2-emissions – up to 90% – compared to classic diesel. Both soot in older vehicles without particle filters and NOx emissions decrease when HVO is used. With regard to our products, HVO has the further advantage that the machines neither have to be newly developed nor exchanged or retrofitted. They can continue working with HVO immediately.”Let’s take a look at consumption: What is the general impact of using HVO in the LR 1700-1.0 and are there other advantages? Federle: “When refuelling with HVO, the volumetric consumption is a little higher, but different application scenarios have a much greater influence here. In addition, the fuel is more resistant to low temperatures. Another advantage is that HVO can be used either as a pure fuel or as an additive to classic diesel, depending on preference and availability.”. Couldn’t the LR 1700-1.0 have been fitted with a battery? Federle: “At Liebherr, we fundamentally pursue an approach that is neutral to all technologies. All our drive technologies are adapted to the machine and the general conditions at the place of operation. This approach shows that electrification is not always sensible or even possible. For example, construction sites in remote, poorly accessible locations do not always offer a reliable charging infrastructure. For example, when erecting wind turbines, infrastructure and power supply are first created by the LR 1700-1.0. Nevertheless, an energy-intensive machine must work reliably. Moreover, with electricity as the energy source, you need a different basic vehicle than with HVO, which means a conversion for every use is technically not possible.”. So the choice of energy source plays just as important a role in efficient and effective use as the choice of crane model. What else is necessary to offer customers, operators and crane drivers the best possible use?Boos: “Here we are again at our customer portal MyLiebherr: it is the central place for all relevant information and services for the LR 1700-1.0 – but also for all other crane models. A few mouse clicks take you to documentation, the spare parts catalogue, the Crane Planner 2.0 or e-learning. If the user registers his machines in MyLiebherr, there are further synergy effects: For example, the machines that the customer has in his fleet will soon be highlighted in the Crane Finder results list.”. And what does the future development of MyLiebherr look like?Boos: “We are constantly working to make the user experience even better. This includes our “Performance"" telemetry solution, which we will also be presenting at Bauma. With a built-in modem, the machine’s position and operating data can be transmitted to the operator here. This makes it possible to react in real time in order to operate the machine even more economically. Together with the telemetry solution and the relaunch of the MyLiebherr interface, the customer portal is increasingly developing into a fleet management tool. With this, operators can manage all their Liebherr machines and achieve efficiency benefits over the complete life cycle.”. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr drive technology – joining the electrification trend,News |09/23/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-drive-technology-%E2%80%93-joining-the-electrification-trend.html?page=30,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr will be showing electric drives with application areas “turn-ing, driving and lifting”. With regard to the topics of climate neutrality and emission reduction, the shift towards electric, emission-free drives is already in full swing in the automotive industry. The construction industry is also closely following suit. But, how can a traction drive of a heavy, track-driven construction machine be electrified without forfeiting performance or compromising availability?Find out more",News,09/23/2022,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr will be showing electric drives with application areas “turning, driving and lifting”. With regard to the topics of climate neutrality and emission reduction, the shift towards electric, emission-free drives is already in full swing in the automotive industry. The construction industry is also closely following suit. But, how can a traction drive of a heavy, track-driven construction machine be electrified without forfeiting performance or compromising availability? “In the coming years, we will certainly see a variety of different types of drive solutions,” says Matthias Kiebler, who is responsible for advance development and innovation management at Liebherr's drive technology department. “The challenge we see for machine manufacturers is that they will have to find solutions for tight installation spaces, weight savings and different speed ranges, among other things – and all this with different weight classes and varying uptime of the application over the course of a day’s operation on the construction site.”In line with this perspective, Liebherr's components product segment will be entering into an open dialog with customers and trade visitors at Bauma 2022, in order to discuss different points of view, to match requirements to applications and technology, and to present potential solutions. “We look forward to exciting discussions, as well as various perspectives and are happy to invite interested parties to join us at our booth 326 in hall A4,” says Thorsten Pohl, head of sales of the drive technology department. In addition to an open discussion on said issues, the Liebherr team will also outline application examples and projects they have implemented for the Liebherr companies, as well as for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).The exhibited LPI600 travel drive with the Liebherr PGK18/22 electric motor that finds its use in the most common sizes of construction machinery is a reallife example. With its compact design, it takes up relatively little space in the crawler undercarriage. This is an advantage when it comes to refurbishing existing undercarriage designs with electrification plans. At the same time, it provides a reliable and robust drive combination, which is completely sealed and secured to allow a wading depth of up to one meter below the waterline.DAT1000 and LPX – the biggest and the heaviest amongst all slewing drive giants„Drives for giant ideas“ at your fingertips: The DAT1000 is one of the largest and most powerful slewing gearboxes to date, which are often used in offshore cranes. Their high-quality design derives from the vast construction and process expertise and aims particularly at heavy-duty applications. With a height of almost three me-tres and its immense power, it can be adapted to customer-specific requirements, for instance with special module sizes, the pinion position at the top or bottom and, optionally, with a hydraulic or electric drive. To ensure permanent crane availability, it offers condition monitoring and can be equipped with appropriate sensor technology for analyses. This way, DATs can contribute to intelligent applications in Industry 4.0 beyond electrical operation.With the LPX, Liebherr announces a new extra-large gearbox series and offers a first insight into the extended portfolio. The LPX gearbox series is intended for the heaviest industrial applications, such as roller presses, forming technology, manipulators in steel mills or ship locks, as well as centrifuges. With an immense force of up to over 7 million Nm and a weight of up to 17 tons, they will be among the strongest and heaviest slewing drives ever produced in the components product segment at the Biberach site in Germany. The LPX gearbox series are also primarily intended for electric drives. The first LPXs will be available in the course of 2023.When safety comes first: DEW550 winch systemMaritime applications, especially ship-to-shore cranes, require reliable components for fast and, above all, safe cargo handling. With the DEW550 derrick winch, Liebherr offers a modular winch system that features high safety measures. Thanks to the use of a secondary brake and an emergency drive with auxiliary motor, goods can be positioned safely and in a controlled manner, even during emergency. This means that the crane can continue to operate reliably without long downtimes. Thanks to an integrated planetary plug-in gear, the modular winch system with an electric drive enables a compact design; it can be assembled quickly and easily. In short: Liebherr’s complete electric winch system offers an all-round carefree pack-age from one single source."

Liebherr shows rail-road excavator for track construction at InnoTrans,Press releases |09/19/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-shows-rail-road-excavator-for-track-construction-at-innotrans.html?page=30,"Liebherr is presenting the A 924 Rail Litronic, a representative of the new generation of its successful rail-road excavators, at InnoTrans 2022 in Berlin. The machine can be used both on rail and on road. To complement the versatile machine, Liebherr will be showing numerous attachments as well as a quick coupling system for a wide range of applications. In addition, trade fair visitors can obtain comprehensive information about ECM certification on site.Find out more",Press releases,09/19/2022,"The trade fair exhibit A 924 Rail Litronic has an operating weight of 21,800 kg to 25,000 kg. The machine is equipped with a 120 kW / 163 hp strong and robust engine. In combination with the optimally coordinated hydraulic system, the machine reach constantly high work speeds with the usual fluid working movements. For exhaust emission stage V Liebherr uses a newly developed SCRT system comprising a SCR catalytic converter and a standard particulate filter. The innovative hydraulic concept consists of a Liebherr variable displacement double pump with independent control circuits. High-performance, hydraulic attachments can thus be operated independently of the working and travel movements of the machines.The rail travel drive is mounted on either side of the undercarriage. During unloading the rail guide is lowered in axle pairs until the inner wheels of the dual tyres are at the track wheel and ensure a frictional connection of the travel drive.The service-orientated layout of the machine guarantees short maintenance periods and minimises the associated costs thanks to the time savings. All maintenance points are easily accessed from the ground.As occupational safety plays an important role in track construction, Liebherr offers safety systems specially developed in-house for rail applications. Numerous equipment features such as the pipe break protection on the lifting and stick cylinders, electronic height and turning radius limitation, load moment limitation i.a.w. EN 15746-2, impact-resistant roof panel made of laminated safety glass, rollover protection system (ROPS) and an emergency exit through the rear window provide maximum safety in all operations.Numerous Liebherr attachments and quick coupling systemLiebherr offers a comprehensive portfolio of attachments to meet the various construction site requirements economically and reliably. With the fully hydraulic Liebherr quick coupling system LIKUFIX® both mechanical and hydraulic attachments can be changed quickly and safely from the operator's cab. The A 924 Rail exhibited at InnoTrans is equipped with LIKUFIX®. Liebherr will also be presenting a wide range of attachments on its stand.Liebherr tilt unit LiTiU and LS 12 stick extensionOne of these, for example, is the Liebherr LiTiU slewing unit. This increases the functionality of attachments by providing an additional slewing angle of up to 2 x 50°. This is a huge advantage especially in track construction where there are generally more restrictions due to the rail infrastructure. LiTiU extends the working range of the machines, because even hard-to-reach places can be worked with the additionally generated swivel angle.At the trade fair LiTiU 33 is showcased as a sandwich attachment, i.e. the connection between the end of the stick and LiTiU, and the connection between the bottom of the LiTiU and the attachment are made via LIKUFIX® .This means the entire unit can be set down quickly and a different attachment, such as the Liebherr stick extension, attached and operational within seconds. The 2.25 metre long Liebherr LS 12 arm extension, which can also be used to extend the working radius of the rail-road excavator, will be on display at InnoTrans. In combination with the stick extension, the machine achieves a reach of about 10 metres and can thus also work on distant sites.GMZ 22 clamshell bucket and TR 20 pivot rotatorThe Liebherr GMZ 22 clamshell buckets are also designed for track construction. The new generation will be presented at the trade fair: for example, hydraulic lines that are tightly fitted to the sides and laid in a protected manner ensure a reduced risk of damage. The new lean design of the ejectors with improved linkage for the grapples, combination and track construction buckets as well as the tilted side plates, lead to more efficient and less resistant grabbing as well as optimised loading and unloading operations. Liebherr will be exhibiting the GMZ 22 with digging shells at the fair. The cutting width of the attachment is 600 mm and the grab capacity is 0.30 m³.Pivot rotators are also indispensable for track construction work today. Liebherr will be exhibiting the TR 20 pivot rotator at the fair. With its endless 360° rotatability, the patented slewing mechanism and the tilt angle of 2 x 50°, it offers maximum flexibility, especially for shaft work.ECM certification at LiebherrIn order to be able to operate in rail transport, compliance with strict rules and regulations is required in addition to the comprehensive machine safety systems. In 2019, the EU Commission initiated a new directive intended to further enhance safety in railway traffic and to improve interoperability. The new EU ECM directive (Entity in Charge of Maintenance) now places responsibility on the owners of rail-road excavators. The DVO (EU) 2019/779, also called the ECM directive, applies to railway vehicles, which operate on the higher-level network. Liebherr rail-road excavators will also fall under this new certification requirement in the futureSuccessful ECM certification will enable Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH to continue giving customers competent consultation and support. Successful certification also means that Liebherr sales and service partners will remain authorised and trained to perform repairs, annual inspections and revisions on Liebherr rail-road excavators. Liebherr-Mietpartner GmbH and Carl Beutlhauser Baumaschinen GmbH are also certified as official ECM entities. This will ensure that Liebherr rail-road excavators also remain available to customers for rental.. Downloads.

Electrification and lower emissions: Exhibits of Liebherr at InnoTrans,Press releases |09/15/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/electrification-and-lower-emissions-exhibits-of-liebherr-at-innotrans-press.html?page=30,"As a highlight exhibit, Liebherr will present an air-free brake actuator for the first time at InnoTrans 2022 in Berlin. The actuator is part of Siemens Mobility's air-free brake system. Liebherr is also exhibiting other technologies and systems for rail vehicles - including a system for positioning wheelsets, a technology demonstrator for propane-based air-conditioning systems and a turbo compressor for fuel cell propulsion.Find out more",Press releases,09/15/2022,"At InnoTrans 2022, Liebherr will be unveiling for the first time a new development for rail vehicle brake operations: The Siemens Mobility air-free brake system and its essential component, the air-free brake actuator. Liebherr and Siemens Mobility jointly developed the electro-hydraulic brake actuator that provides the brake force for the brake system.. Air-free brake actuator with ""brake-by-wire"" ready for series productionIn contrast to a conventional pneumatic brake, the brake control in the new air-free brake system from Siemens is completely electrical. This system, also known as ""brake-by-wire,"" therefore eliminates the need for all piping and all pneumatic components for controlling the brake. Siemens Mobility is using the new brake technology for the first time in the ""X-Wagen"" metro project in Vienna (Austria). There, it will go into passenger service at the end of 2022. In operation, the new system leads to lower costs in several areas: in maintenance, for example, and it also reduces the time required for train commissioning as well as cycle time.153 years after development of the Westinghouse air brake, there is a real alternative available, which is ready for serial application. This innovation impresses with its decentralized architecture, compact design and various braking modes in one unit. Piping, compressors, and valve panels are no longer required for braking and can therefore be omitted entirely. Only a 24 V power supply and a CAN interface are used to control the brake actuator. Electronics and software are integrated in the actuator and were developed by Liebherr according to the highest safety requirements (SIL4).. Less wear on rails: Liebherr’s controlled axle steeringIn addition to the innovation for braking technology, Liebherr is also showing its pioneering solution for active wheelset control. The active wheelset steering system ""LiCAS"" (Liebherr Controlled Axle Steering) significantly reduces wear on rails and wheels. LiCAS thus contributes to the longevity of rail infrastructure and the conservation of resources.The system was developed by Liebherr-Transportation Systems and successfully subjected to an initial field test in cooperation with the British railroad company Grand Central (part of the Arriva Group) and NewRail (the center for rail transport research at Newcastle University).. Air-conditioning system with natural refrigerant propaneLiebherr-Transportation Systems is committed to making sustainable air-conditioning systems using natural refrigerants available to the global rail market. In addition to the existing technologies with the refrigerants R729 (air) or R744 (CO2), the company is currently focusing on solutions with R290 (propane).Liebherr will be presenting a demonstrator for this purpose at the trade show. The corresponding technical concept, which takes into account all relevant safety requirements, was developed in cooperation with TÜV Süd. It is being implemented and verified on an existing passenger compartment air-conditioning system. A first series production-ready version will be available for the market from mid-2023.. Turbo compressor for fuel cells in rail trafficLiebherr is also further expanding its expertise in solutions for zero-emission transport. Through cooperations with major car, truck and bus manufacturers, the range of electrically powered turbo compressors is growing. These can be used not only in maritime applications, long-distance buses, trucks and off-road vehicles, but also in fuel cells on board rail vehicles. The current versions cover the 25 kW, 35 kW and 55 kW power ranges.The compressors and power electronics are designed, developed and produced by Liebherr: The two competence centers – Liebherr-Aerospace Toulouse (France), the specialist for air and thermal management systems, and Liebherr-Elektronik GmbH (Germany), the specialist for controls and power electronics – have joined forces for this purpose. The first series production of electric compressors is planned for the end of 2022.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

First R 980 SME shovel in France,Press releases |09/15/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/first-r-980-sme-shovel-in-france.html?page=31,"Through its local distributor, SOMTP Brittany, Liebherr delivered its first R 980 SME with bottom dump shovel in France in 2021. This is the largest member of the range developed and manufactured by Liebherr-France SAS in Colmar.Find out more",Press releases,09/15/2022,"In use at our customer Traineau’s granite-quarrying operation at Aizenay in Vendée, the Liebherr R 980 SME excavator with bottom dump shovel was just what managing director Christophe Traineau needed.The excavator’s origins, with design and production “made in France”, along with the Liebherr brand’s excellent reputation, were decisive factors for him. Vital to our activities, after-sales service managed jointly by Liebherr and SOMTP continues to play an essential role in maintaining good relationships between client, distributor and manufacturer.Ideal for quarrying solid rock, this excavator provides an optimal view of the hopper thanks to its 1.20 m fixed cab elevation. Equipped with a bottom dump shovel, this excavator is a strong performer, with a different way of working from a classic backhoe bucket, explains excavator driver Cédric Di Gallo. The R 980 SME excavator enables very rapid operational cycles, thus increasing efficiency and productivity.. Putting the accent on comfort and safetyIn addition to the cab elevation, access to the excavator is improved by a retractable ladder, widened access walkways and a hand rail all along the uppercarriage to assure safe and easy access for the operator and maintenance personnel. These access features were developed for Liebherr mining excavators.Access points are also equipped with timed LED lighting which enables safer access at the start of a shift or at the end of the day.This excavator offers a very high level of comfort: with electric joysticks, shovel flap opening via the joystick and semi-automatic flap closing, the seat suspension, and soundproofing inside and out, the R 980 SME can truly be said to provide the ultimate in flexibility and ergonomic design.The bottom dump shovel that comes with the excavator was developed and manufactured by Liebherr-France SAS in Colmar. With 5.1 m³ capacity, this bottom dump shovel is supplied with a level 3 wear package kit (the highest level) to withstand the abrasiveness of the materials it handles. In this configuration, the bucket weighs in at 11,000 kg. The bucket’s delta blade guarantees optimum penetration into mined materials, even when they are tightly bound to each other.. An excavator tailored to the customer’s needsTraineau opted for the Liebherr R 980 SME excavator because this model is especially well suited to our customer's granite quarrying operation. The 104 tonne excavator is used for the various operating phases: rock sorting, rock crushing with the drop-ball, and loading at the quarry face. The shovel attachment is especially effective and accurate in the sorting and crushing processes.With a total production of around 800,000 tonnes of aggregate per year, our customer Traineau seems more than satisfied with the R 980 SME excavator and its low fuel consumption of 55 litres per hour. After reaching the 1,000 hour mark with the machine, the customer is well placed to confirm that the shovel attachment allows it to reduce cycle times and thus speed up dump truck loading..

Simply strong: safe and efficient force-measurement within Liebherr hydraulic cylinders,Press releases |09/14/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/simply-strong-safe-and-efficient-force-measurement-within-liebherr-hydraulic-cylinders.html?page=31,"The new type of force measurement within hydraulic cylinders helps to measure static, as well as dynamic tensile and compressive loads precisely and dynamically. A dedicated sensor is currently in prototype status. The results enable greater efficiency and safety in a wide range of mobile and stationary applications.Find out more",Press releases,09/14/2022,"At its site in Kirchdorf an der Iller (Germany), Liebherr's components product segment is increasingly focusing on sensor solutions and their efficient use in hydraulic cylinders. One driver, for example, is force-measurement within the cylinder. It is always advantageous, when precise and dynamic values of the forces prevailing within the hydraulic cylinder are required. This is the case, when monitoring loads in excavators and cranes. In this way, dangerous situations during crane operation can be avoided and the efficiency of the machine can be improved. The prevailing force in the cylinder is conventionally determined indirectly via the oil pressure. These measured values are prone to error due to internal friction, for example. This is why Liebherr relies on direct force-measurement via strain with the force-measurement sensor.The internal measuring points track both tensile and compressive forces regardless of lateral forces and torques. ""The measuring method ensures significantly more precise and dynamic measurement results,'' explains Hans-Peter Laverne, Head of Advanced Development at Liebherr-Components Kirchdorf GmbH. “This establishes the conditions for higher productivity and safety in daily use in various applications.''Intelligent setup, many possibilitiesAt this point, Liebherr force-measurement on the hydraulic cylinder is a functioning sensor prototype. It stands out in particular due to its high diversity in application. During the design phase, Liebherr's development team checks and takes into account individual adaptations with regard to the operator’s wishes and needs. This allows Liebherr to offer customised solutions.Small sensor, huge advantagesThe improved force-measurement brings further advantages. These include, for example, an increased performance of assistance systems through optimised sensitivity. Thanks to highly dynamic and precise measurement, longer service life is also possible in the future. This will play a decisive role not only in condition monitoring, but also in downsizing..

Active personnel detection for Liebherr wheel loaders receives 2022 VDBUM Award,Press releases |09/13/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/active-personnel-detection-for-liebherr-wheel-loaders-receives-2022-vdbum-award.html?page=31,"The German Association of Construction, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering (VDBUM) awarded active personnel detection with the 2022 VDBUM Award. Active personnel detection is an intelligent assistance system developed by Liebherr for the Group’s wheel loaders.Find out more",Press releases,09/13/2022,"In July, the expert jury awarded active personnel detection in the category “Developments from Industry”. Active personnel detection uses sensors and artificial intelligence to automatically distinguish between persons and objects in order to specifically warn the machine operator of an accident that may result in personal injury. If a person moves into the rear area of the wheel loader, the system alerts the operator at a greater distance than for static objects such as walls or columns. This intelligent classification reduces the number of unnecessary warning signals to make the machine operator’s work easier.. Brake assistant and incident map as important functions of active personnel detectionIn addition to the targeted warning signals, the brake assistant and the incident map are further functions of the active personnel detection system that help to prevent accidents. As soon as the sensors detect a potential danger, the brake assistant automatically slows down the wheel loader. This eliminates the human reaction time required for conventional braking. This shortens the stopping distance by potentially crucial metres, further reducing the frequency and severity of accidents.With each warning signal, the assistance system transmits a GPS signal to Liebherr’s LiDAT data transmission and positioning system. Based on this, Liebherr provides the incident map, a visualisation of risk zones and potential accident sources on the plant site, for every operator of a wheel loader with active personnel detection in LiDAT. This allows the plant operator to take action to prevent accidents and thus increase safety.. Liebherr participates with various technical presentations at the VDBUM grand seminarIn addition, Liebherr presented three interesting technical lectures as part of the 50th VDBUM grand seminar. “Strong partnership between the building contractor and the manufacturer”, was the title of one of them, a joint presentation by Rudolf Arnold (Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH), Thorsten Hesselbein (Liebherr-Werk Biberach GmbH) and Martin Philipp (STRABAG BMTI GmbH & Co. KG). The speakers gave an insight into the decades of successful cooperation between STRABAG, a leading European technology partner for construction services, and Liebherr based on projects they have implemented together, as well as an outlook on how foundations for the future are built together with customers.

They are used with great success for demolition work or in quarries, among other things, especially in the north and north-east of France. The performance, stability at work, flexible use and comfort of these large excavators are impressing more and more local customers.Find out more",Press releases,09/08/2022,"A Liebherr R 956 crawler excavator of Vitse is currently being used for the demanding demolition of buildings in the commune of Laon, in Northern France. The group's long-standing French customer bought the machine from the local dealer Toufflin mtp in the Hauts-de-France region, also in northern France.The R 956 is equipped with an 8-metre straight gooseneck boom and Antoine Vitse, the managing director of the company, is particularly impressed. He places great emphasis on the versatility of the excavator as well as the optimal safety conditions for the operator both at the construction site as well as in the direct working environment.The quality of the excavator and its components constitute a special feature, which is why the company has relied on Liebherr for three generations. By using a hydraulic hammer or sorting grapple, the excavator can be easily adapted for any application.The excavator is prepared for numerous demolition work attachments at the factory and furthermore has GPS control to carry out earthworks with maximum precision. Compared to the previous generation R 954 C excavator, the operator can see a significant saving in fuel consumption: It is only 30 litres per hour. The machine operator benefits from very high performance and digging force as well as large lifting capacity, coupled with optimal comfort thanks to the suspension seat and excellent sound insulation of the operator's cab.For Antoine Vitse, the good reputation of Liebherr is also one of the most important criteria when making a purchase decision. According to the managing director, Liebherr ensures a good price-performance ratio and Toufflin MTP, the local dealer, provides efficient and responsive customer service.. Quick cycle times for the loading of dump trucksAlso in the Hauts-de-France region, a little further north in Haut-Lieu, a Liebherr R 960 SME excavator is being used to remove rock at the Bocahut quarry, the largest limestone quarry in the Eiffage Group. This excavator replaces the identical R 960 SME model of the previous generation with a stage IIIB drive. The company was so pleased with this excavator that it decided to go for the same model again, this time in the new version with numerous advancements.Laurent Lobry, production manager of the quarry, underlines the versatility of this Liebherr excavator, which makes it possible to load dump trucks, carry out preparatory work and remove stones, as well as prepare the site for various works, lay out lanes and embankments.To achieve an annual production of 3,000,000 tonnes of stone, the excavator offers very quick work cycles. With the power capacity of the hydraulic system, the excavator achieves significant increases in performance.The various engine speed settings and the electronic control of the machine make it possible to significantly reduce fuel consumption compared to the previous generation of excavator. This consumption is an important criterion and is strictly monitored by the person responsible.Some elements such as the underside protection of the dipper arm or the protective guard of the operator's cab make this machine the ideal tool for working safely. Laurent Lobry places great importance on the manufacture of the excavator in France as a guarantee of quality. The comfort of his operator in the operator's cab is also important to him, so that they can operate the excavator all day long without discomfort with the help of ergonomic controls, a suspension seat and an intuitive touchscreen.. A Liebherr excavator adapted to the requirements of the customerIn the Aube department, in the Grand Est region, the quarry company Carrières Champenoises in Jully-sur-Sarce has decided on an R 976 excavator. This massive excavator with an operating weight of 97 t is the ideal excavator for removing the rock in this limestone quarry. As the company was extremely satisfied with the predecessor, R 976 Stage IV, Anne-Blandine Bourgoin, head of the quarry, once again puts her trust in Liebherr and chooses the successor model with the same designation as the new excavator.The Liebherr-France SAS production plant has developed three special tools that can be attached to the Liebherr SW 92 quick change unit: a narrow removal bucket, a scaling tooth with a short radius “made-to-measure” and a pick-up bucket. The definition and final design of the tools was carried out in close cooperation between the planning office of Liebherr-France SAS and the experienced users on site - the excavator operators. For the manager, considering the individual customer wishes in order to understand the requirements and adapt the machine accordingly is an important plus point.The hydraulic power combined with the electronic control of the machine make this excavator a suitable and powerful tool that offers high precision and flexibility in movements thanks to the electric joysticks and is very popular on the quarrying front where most of the quarrying is done directly and without blasting.The high load-bearing capacity and digging power complete the performance of the excavator. Optimal comfort for the operator thanks to the sound insulation in the operator's platform, increased safety thanks to LED lighting and the perfect view are also worth mentioning.Anne-Blandine Bourgoin appreciates the new generation of stage V drive which emits less CO2 because the quarry is subject to environmental regulations and controls its emissions.

Liebherr introduces H2 direct injection for heavy-duty combustion engines,Press releases |09/07/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-introduces-h2-direct-injection-for-heavy-duty-combustion-engines.html?page=31,"Liebherr develops injection systems for hydrogen combustion engines used in on- and off-highway applications. Robustness against dust, dirt and vibrations, as well as other harsh environmental conditions are but a few of the key requirements. Peak power and dynamic load changes are among the other challenges for H2 combustion engines. Coming close to the diesel engine in terms of performance and drivability, in all applications, is one of the biggest challenges yet. Liebherr's system-oriented approach to hydrogen injection combines various components to control pressure and flow. This enables the same driving characteristics as a diesel, while maintaining a sturdy system design.Find out more",Press releases,09/07/2022,"Liebherr presents a hydrogen direct injection solution for heavy-duty combustion engines at Bauma 2022. With this technology, the Group aims at achieving maximum power density equal to the one of a conventional combustion engine. Hydrogen-based powertrains are an important part of Liebherr's technology-open approach to alternative drive concepts.Hydrogen direct injection: What's behind it?The aim of matching the performance of an H2-DI engine to that of a diesel engine requires the system to be capable of ensuring high flow rates. Due to the low density of hydrogen gas, the injector needs large valve cross-sections. To enable a precise control of even the smallest quantities, the system pressure must be regulated with pinpoint accuracy. In Liebherr's H2 injection system, this is achieved by means of a gas volume control valve. Additional attention is given to minimal nozzle leakage from the injector. At best, the injector should be gas-tight.""To achieve the same drivability with a H2 system as with a diesel, the hydrogen injection system must be optimally aligned with the engine's torque and power"", explains Richard Pirkl, Managing Director of Technology and Development at Liebherr-Components Deggendorf GmbH. ""This means that during the transition from idle to full load, the necessary amount of fuel and the corresponding system pressure must be made available as quickly as possible."". System Design Low Pressure Direct Injection (LPDI)Liebherr's H2 injection system is designed to provide extremely fast and accurate pressure control, regardless of fuel tank position, machine size, layout or engine installation. This design provides a two-stage pressure control. While the first stage initially stabilises the variable pressure from the fuel tank, the second stage fine-tunes said pressure. The injection pressure is controlled by activating the gas-metering valve via the electronic control unit (ECU). The ECU controls the gas-metering valve by a closed-loop feed-forward controller. Custom-developed hydrogen-specific software modules can be integrated into third-party application software and/ or control units.""The H2-DI system is designed to operate without an electronic pressure release valve. The idea behind it is to keep the system as simple as possible, whilst avoiding the release of any hydrogen gas into the atmosphere during operation"", Richard Pirkl summarises.The injector: a key component""The injector is the most sophisticated and, at the same time, performance-determining component of the hydrogen fuel system"", explains Pirkl. The overall dimensions of Liebherr's H2 LPDI injector are very similar to those of diesel injectors for heavy-duty commercial vehicle engines. In particular, the critical maximum outer diameter is within the same range as for diesel injectors.In the current sample stage, the injector can be equipped with various hydrogen connections by means of a screw-in insert. Two basic variants of the injector head (radial and axial H2 inlet) allow for different installation situations. To ensure the correct spray pattern and jet direction, the injector nozzle is equipped with a diffuser cap. ""It is interchangeable in the sample stage and allows cost-effective testing of different variations to define the best configuration. Using a screw solution, the diffuser cap can be easily replaced"", says Richard Pirkl.The injector is opened and closed via a needle that is directly activated by the magnet. To meet the target housing dimensions, the magnet grew thoroughly in size. The challenges thereby were to achieve sufficient magnetic force for direct activation, while matching the critical external dimensions in the magnet area to the engine manufacturer's requirements. Multiple simulations of different magnet concepts, materials and installation situations accompanied the process. The magnet force is now tuned in such a way that, on the one hand, proper opening of the injector is possible and, on the other hand, the closing delay is reduced to a minimum.""An additional key development goal was to control the hydrogen injector with the existing control units of diesel engines and with the current standard profiles already known from these applications"", Pirkl summarises.. Test results at a glanceAs previously mentioned, the tightness of the injector against hydrogen is one of the biggest challenges in the development of H2 components. Tests on a vacuum leakage test rig show very good results for Liebherr's current injector concept.""Measured injection rates of the current sample stand already show extremely stable progressions. Overall, the injector displays a good opening and closing behaviour"", explains Pirkl. ""On the functional test bench, we have been able to show good controllability of the injection rate at different pressure levels. The required minimum injection rates of ~2.5 mg per stroke are achieved at 10 bar rail pressure"".Liebherr has carried out all the tests with a completely dry-running injector without any addition of lubricating oil. Since the injector was developed exclusively for hydrogen and, thus, no concepts and parts of a natural gas or gasoline injector platform were used, the focus was on the dry-running capability of the moving components. The Liebherr team in Deggendorf is currently undertaking endurance testing.Hydrogen direct injection: current development and outlookHydrogen direct injection is particularly well suited for applications with high demands on dynamics and power density within a limited installation space. Initial tests have shown that hydrogen DI is a feasible concept, which Liebherr in Deggendorf is planning to pursue further. ""Product validation will be one of the most important tasks in the development of hydrogen fuel systems in the future"", says Richard Pirkl. ""The next steps are to optimise the low-pressure DI system in terms of injection stability and dynamic performance. Based on the low-pressure DI system for heavy-duty engines, we are also developing and testing a system with higher flow rates for larger engines"", concludes Pirkl.In parallel, Liebherr is working on PFI injectors. The system approaches for intake manifold and direct injection use a common, scalable injector platform as the basis. With this extensive product portfolio, Liebherr meets a wide range of engine requirements and enables a broad spectrum of applications for medium- and heavy-duty engines, as well as large engines..

The beginning of a new era,Press releases |08/30/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-beginning-of-a-new-era.html?page=32,"Liebherr's portfolio of port and transshipment solutions has been expanded to include the all-electric transshipment crane CBG 500 E. The crane combines state-of-the-art drive technologies with Liebherr's own crane control system ""Master V"". Another highlight is the energy recovery system LiCaTronic®, which makes optimum use of the energy available. The numerous configurations ensure that the crane is versatile and adaptable to different customer needs.Find out more",Press releases,08/30/2022,"The new all-electric crane CBG 500 E expands the transshipment solutions portfolio with a reliable machine that offers a handling performance of up to 2,000 tonnes per hour. The all-electric drives inside the crane in combination with the supercapacitors turn the rope luffing CBG 500 E into a unique handling solution in the market. The supercapacitors used as standard in Liebherr's own LiCaTronic® energy recovery system support the increasing requirements regarding energy efficiency. The combination of state-of-the-art inverter technology, power storage and application-specific power management leads in a powerful drive system with simultaneous reduction of the required energy. The CBG 500 E is a heavy-duty transshipment crane that operates emission-free and environmentally friendly.. New interior, new exteriorIn addition to the powerful and efficient drives, the whole crane structure is optimised for an extraordinary performance. The boom of the CBG 500 E was designed as a lattice boom. This makes it particularly stiff and light, which further improves the turnover performance and at the same time reduces the energy need. The result is a lifting capacity of up to 105 tonnes in hook operation and a maximum grab capacity of up to 90 tonnes. The extension of the cabin and the high positioning ensure that the crane operator has an optimal viewing angle of all processes. The crane operator is supported operationally by the new, integrated ""Master V"" crane control system. Together with an even more efficient software architecture, it forms the basis for integrating future assistance and automation systems into the crane in the long term.. Flexibility as a core valueWith the CBG 500 E, a crane has been developed that can be flexibly adapted to its subsequent purpose. An essential choice concerns the length of the boom, as the crane can be configured with 43 m and 50 m boom. The longer boom variant offers the decisive advantage of enabling direct transshipment between two vessels in sheltered and open water. The modes of operation range from bulk to container handling and are independent of the area of operation. For installation on a barge, the crane can be equipped with additional counterweights, enabling safe cargo handling in this application as well. Optional configuration options such as a comfort ascent or additional platforms and boom walkways for maintenance purposes complete the configuration possibilities.. A crane with recognition valueThe CBG 500 E is designed in a colour combination of grey and white. The engine house with the all-electric drives is highlighted in yellow. The colour scheme is based on the Liebherr colours yellow, white and black in order to create recognition. For clear identification of the machine, a combination of logo and type designation of the crane is placed on both sides. In combination with the blue line and the addition ""All-electric"", it is clearly recognisable the CBG 500 E is characterised by advanced and zero emission crane technology..

First Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 in Saudi Arabia goes to ACT ,Press releases |08/30/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/first-liebherr-ltm-1650-8-1-in-saudi-arabia-goes-to-act.html?page=32,"ACT Arabian Consolidated Trading Est. has become the first company in Saudi Arabia to take delivery of a Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 mobile crane. The company previously reported positive experiences with its predecessor model, the Liebherr LTM 1500-8.1. The LTM 1650-8.1 is expected to set new standards in the Saudi Arabian crane market. ACT opted for the full equipment package including both telescopic boom lengths, 54 and 80 metres, at the time of purchase.Find out more",Press releases,08/30/2022,"Crane and heavy lifting company ACT has taken delivery of its first LTM 1650-8.1 in Saudi Arabia. Its predecessor model, the LTM 1500-8.1, had previously been successfully used by ACT. ""The LTM 1500-8.1 is a proven crane within the ACT Group that has also impressed our customers,"" says Hassan Mohammed Rashid Al-Naimi, founder and president of ACT. The new LTM 1650-8.1 outperforms its predecessor by 15 to 50 per cent in terms of load capacity – depending on the equipment. ""We wanted to have Saudi Arabia's first LTM 1650-8.1. ACT has always been a pioneer and has set standards in the crane business in Saudi Arabia. And we have now done this once again with the new 700-tonne crane,"" explains Al-Naimi.ACT purchased the full package with two boom variantsAt ACT it is standard practice to buy fully equipped cranes – the Saudi Arabian company therefore did likewise when purchasing the LTM 1650-8.1, acquiring both telescopic boom lengths in the process. The new crane can be equipped with a 54 or 80-metre boom. To switch between them, only the corresponding telescopic sections must be changed, rather than the entire boom. This option allows the advantages of both boom variants to be exploited. The 80-metre boom offers large hoist heights and radii, making ACT's new 700-tonne crane suitable for jobs that fall between the capabilities of the LTM 1500-8.1 and the LTM 11200-9.1. The 54-metre telescopic boom offers advantages in terms of mobility, allowing the crane to travel on the road with the front supports and a twelve-tonne axle load. To minimise the set-up time, however, the rear supports are installed as complete support boxes in a single hoist and connected using quick couplings. ""We need a fast crane, a so-called taxi crane. The LTM 1650-8.1 is easy to mobilise. This is important for emergency maintenance work in the refineries, where we only have four hours to set up for shutdown work. The new 700-tonne crane is the best choice here,"" explains Al-Naimi.High level of satisfaction with Liebherr's technology and serviceThe technical aspects of Liebherr cranes are highly valued by ACT. ""Generally speaking, everyone here at ACT is convinced by the standards Liebherr sets each time they launch a new product."" This satisfaction with Liebherr cranes also extends to ACT's customers: ""Our customer Aramco is very satisfied with Liebherr in the field of refinery maintenance and shutdown work in particular,"" says Al-Naimi. This is also where the main application areas for ACT's new LTM 1650-8.1 lie. Liebherr's fast and reliable service is also very important for ACT, since it keeps crane downtime to a minimum.Good business relations for over 30 yearsACT purchased its first Liebherr crane in 1987. ""Willi Liebherr's visit to our site in 1992 strengthened our business relationship even further,"" says Al-Naimi. ""Apart from our partnership, we are very satisfied with Liebherr's service and local presence in Saudi Arabia. This is also the reason why our customers prefer Liebherr for these types of large orders.""The crane and heavy-duty company ACT Arabian Consolidated Trading Est was founded in Saudi Arabia in 1986 and has grown steadily ever since. Besides its many years of experience in the area of crane and heavy-duty equipment rental, the company also focuses on modernisation measures. In total, ACT Arabian Consolidated Trading Est operates 238 cranes, 180 of which were manufactured by Liebherr.

New all-electric heavy lift ship crane,News |08/22/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-all-electric-heavy-lift-ship-crane.html?page=32,Liebherr's heavy lift crane series is being expanded with an 800 tonnes crane. The aim with the new crane is to establish itself in the growth market of ever larger wind industry components. The crane is fully electrically powered and thus enables a reduction of CO2 emissions on the ship side in scenarios typical for heavy lift vessels.Find out more,News,08/22/2022,"The growth of wind turbines is leading to increasingly heavy individual component weights. In addition, the handling of large components requires a longer outreach of the cranes used than is often the case in the market. The supply of heavy lift vessels with cranes offering a maximum lifting capacity of 800 tonnes is lower than the expected future demand. Liebherr therefore sees a growth market in this crane segment and in the matching new shipbuilding. The Liebherr ship crane enters a new segment and expands the product portfolio of heavy lift ship cranes. ""The new cranes follow on from a long tradition and decades of experience in building ship cranes. The first ship crane was delivered by Liebherr in 1958. The push into the 800 tonnes size segment does not represent new territory – Liebherr has already supplied onshore and offshore cranes in the 3000-5000 tonnes category,"" comments Gregor Levold, Sales Director for Liebherr Offshore, Ship and Port Cranes.. All-electric and CO2 emission-freeIn addition to the much larger dimensions of the crane, the LS 800 E is particularly impressive due to its all-electric drive concept. All sections of the crane are electrically driven. As a result, the machine achieves higher energy efficiency and thus significantly reduces the ship's CO2 emissions. Liebherr is already prepared for future environmental requirements in the maritime industry. ""We have many years of experience with all-electric drives from the port equipment sector, among others. As usual, the development of the crane is done completely in-house. We can also cover the procurement of individual components largely in-house at Liebherr. These are invaluable advantages for our customers, especially nowadays,"" adds Levold. In addition, all drive components are installed inside the crane. This facilitates the integration of the crane into the ship's design and enables better utilisation of the areas below deck.Tradition meets futureThe new “Master V” control unit offers the highest computing power. The accompanying faster data processing enables the integration of future assistance systems and semi-automated process applications. All heavy-lift cranes are characterised by the Litronic control system developed in-house. It combines speed and precision and thus ensures a safe and at the same time efficient loading process. Continuous further development means that the latest features and applications will continue to be available to Liebherr ship cranes in the future.. New crane designation and designDuring the design of the LS 800 E, the designation of the Liebherr ship cranes was furthermore adjusted. Instead of the previous CBB crane designation, the cranes will be called LS in the future. The new terms and the capital letters used allow a direct assignment as Liebherr (L) – ship crane (S). The number, as part of the designation, provides information about the maximum load capacity, which is 800 tonnes for the LS 800 E. The E stands for the electric drive and is supplemented by the suffix ""All-electric"" in the case of fully electric cranes such as the LS 800 E.The exterior design of the crane has been renewed. The crane is factory coloured in white and grey and the designation of the crane is on the tower. The blue accent and the blue E symbol next to the crane type designation visually clarify the electric drive of the machine. This allows all future customers to directly communicate advanced and low-emission crane technology to their stakeholders.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

This significantly increases mobility on public roads. The reduced total weight means that more bridges can be crossed, for example, which saves detours and time. Colonia sales manager Thomas Reuther explains: ""We have to face the difficult infrastructure problems especially here in the Cologne area. For this reason, we were the first in Germany to tackle the issue of detachable booms. The LTM 1650-8.1 is now the fourth large crane with this system in our fleet. More will follow in the future.""Colonia's main areas of operation are in the chemical sector. The LTM 1650-8.1 will also find its work mainly in the Cologne chemical belt, in addition to many other applications and activities. ""The LTM 1650-8.1 was the only reasonable alternative for us to close our gap between the LTM 1400-7.1 and LTM 1750-9.1. In order to take full advantage of all the technical possibilities of the LTM 1650-8.1, we opted for the 54-metre and also the 80-metre telescopic boom. The variable support base VarioBase® and the hydraulically adjustable ballast radius VarioBallast® are Liebherr innovations that we no longer want to do without. They were also reasons for us to opt for the new Liebherr 8-axle crane,"" says Reuther.Colonia Spezialfahrzeuge celebrated its 75th anniversary two years ago. It all started in 1945 with a self-built trailer and a towing vehicle. In the 1960s, the first truck-mounted cranes were acquired. In 2020, Colonia entered the crawler crane class with the Liebherr LR 1800-1.0.

Jandt expands crane fleet with Liebherr LTM 1150-5.3 mobile crane,Press releases |08/19/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/jandt-expands-crane-fleet-with-liebherr-ltm-1150-5-3-mobile-crane.html?page=32,"Jandt Kranvermietung GmbH has taken delivery of a Liebherr LTM 1150-5.3 mobile crane. With the new 150-tonne crane, the company from Bielefeld complements its crane fleet in the range between 100 and 200 tonnes lifting capacity.Find out more",Press releases,08/19/2022,"Authorised signatory Jens Lübeck travelled to the Liebherr manufacturing plant in Ehingen to take delivery of the new LTM 1150-5.3. He reports: ""In the range of our cranes between the 100 and 200 tonne class, we previously only had the LTM 1130-5.1. And since this was always very well utilised, we wanted to provide it with a reinforcement. The LTM 1150-5.3, which Liebherr has launched on the market as the successor to the 130-tonner, was therefore the logical choice for us.""Long and strong telescopic boom with simultaneous economic mobilityAfter building around 1,500 units, Liebherr presented the LTM 1150-5.3 in autumn 2020 as the successor to the successful LTM 1130-5.1. With a maximum lifting capacity of 150 tonnes and a 66-metre telescopic boom, it complements the Liebherr crane range below the 180-tonne LTM 1160-5.2. The telescopic boom, which is ten per cent longer than its predecessor, lifts loads that are on average 15 per cent higher, both with maximum and partial ballast. The achievement of the Liebherr engineers here was that the low overall weight of the predecessor could be maintained: With twelve tonnes of axle load, the crane carries nine tonnes of ballast on public roads.This was also an important criterion for Jandt Kranvermietung GmbH when deciding on the purchase. ""With nine tonnes of ballast, we can use the LTM 1150-3.1 excellently in the taxi crane business. If we need more power, we can get by with just one vehicle when transporting the counterweight. This allows us to offer our customers a very economical solution,"" says Lübeck.Classic areas of application for the new 150-tonne crane at Jandt will be construction crane assembly and support work in wind power, as well as precast concrete assembly and activities on construction sites in the energy sector. In this context, Lübeck emphasises the high lifting capacity values with 45 tonnes maximum ballast and the 6-metre longer telescopic boom compared to the LTM 1130-5.1.Long-standing partnership with Liebherr20 telescopic mobile cranes in Jandt's fleet bear the Liebherr logo. Lübeck explains: ""As a long-standing customer, we appreciate the partnership and the innovative strength of Liebherr. These factors have contributed significantly to the success and growth of our company. We are convinced of the cost-effectiveness of the products, for example the Liebherr single-engine concept, which has enabled us to further reduce the CO2 emissions of our fleet. On the other hand, we benefit from the excellent service for our entire fleet.""Jandt is also consistently focusing on CO2 reduction with the procurement of the new LTM 1150-5.3. As with the latest developments in the Liebherr mobile crane series, the 150-tonner also features ECOmode in crane operation for fuel and CO2 savings and noise reduction. On the one hand, the complete pump drive can be automatically disengaged in engine idling mode and switched back on again in a matter of seconds via the intelligent control system when power is required. On the other hand, the crane control system automatically calculates the optimum engine speed for the working speed preselected via the control lever in order to avoid unnecessarily excessive engine speeds. When driving on the road, there is also a switchable eco mode that prescribes an optimised driving setting that saves fuel and CO2 and reduces noise..

It takes two to tango,Press releases |08/12/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/it-takes-two-to-tango.html?page=32,The Port of Esbjerg is a long-standing partner of Liebherr and has recently ordered a second LHM 800. The new crane is already the seventh Liebherr mobile harbour crane to be used at Denmark's largest port. Next-generation offshore wind turbines will be lifted with the new heavy-duty crane. Liebherr will deliver a further crane of the type LHM 600 to Port Esbjerg before the end of the year.Find out more,Press releases,08/12/2022,"Port Esbjerg is the leading port in Europe when it comes to handling and shipping wind energy components. The port played a key role in the rise of Denmark’s offshore wind industry: 80% of the offshore wind capacity installed in Europe was shipped from the Port of Esbjerg. Their record for breakbulk is notable, as the port handles more than 500,000 tonnes of major wind turbine components each year. Therefore, it is decisive that the port is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment. The first LHM 800 for Port Esbjerg was delivered in 2019. The upcoming delivery in 2023 of the recently ordered second LHM 800 marks the seventh Liebherr mobile harbour crane purchased by Denmark's largest port. Port Esbjerg will be the third port in the world to have two LHM 800 cranes in its fleet.. Long partnershipWith the second LHM 800, Port Esbjerg will also be able to carry out tandem lifts of up to 616 tonnes. This means that components of the next generation of offshore wind turbines can be handled. Mr Dennis Jul Pedersen, CEO at Port Esbjerg, says: “Our competency lies in breakbulk and in having the capacity for tandem lifts above 600 tonnes, which is necessary not only in the on- and offshore wind market but also in supporting production in the hinterland.”Liebherr and Port Esbjerg have enjoyed a partnership for many years. The first Liebherr mobile harbour crane, an LHM 1080, was bought by the port in 1994. Many further units followed in the years after. Together with Port Esbjerg, Liebherr developed its unique Sycratronic tandem-lift assistance system.""The Port of Esbjerg has been pursuing major expansion plans for decades. Our company supports the port's development by delivering a high-quality product, reliable service and innovative technology. We are grateful for the opportunity to succeed together and continue our partnership,"" comments Roman Chopyk, Sales Manager for Liebherr mobile harbour cranes.. Liebherr for the wind industryOffshore wind power activities are expected to increase significantly over the next decade, and, as wind turbines get bigger, powerful equipment is needed to handle these components. The ability to handle heavy components with mobile harbour cranes is considered to be essential for efficient and flexible harbour operations. Liebherr’s mobile harbour cranes are versatile and allow for the handling of all types of goods even at wind speeds of up to 24 metres per second, thus providing the best possible operability.The LHM 800 is the largest and most powerful mobile harbour crane in the Liebherr LHM portfolio. The machine meets the ever-increasing demand for mobile heavy-duty cranes in the maritime sector. A key driver of this development is clearly the wind industry. In a special heavy-lift version, the LHM 800 is capable of lifting weights of up to 308 tonnes and up to 616 tonnes in tandem mode with the intelligent Liebherr system Sycratronic.Tandem lifts over 600 tonnesSycratronic is a computerised assistance system for operating two cranes with one crane operator. This makes the system not only suit ideally for tandem lifts of turbines over 600 tonnes, but also ideal for handling rotor blades, which in the offshore sector can be over 90 metres long. Sycratronic speeds up turnover time and increases safety as the computer monitors operation to avoid overloads and compensate for the displacement of components being loaded..

The project was funded by the Austrian Climate Energy Fund and supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), Vienna.The aim of the project was to develop an environmentally friendly CO2 air conditioning system for rail vehicles as an alternative to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems operated with conventional refrigerants. To this end, a near-production Fast Track Demonstrator (FTD) for an HVAC system with heat pump function using the natural refrigerant R744 (CO2) was developed and installed in a passenger coach from the Railjet fleet operated by ÖBB.. Liebherr had previously tested the FTD in a climatic chamber and then, in cooperation with ÖBB, recorded and evaluated the performance of the system in regular train operation under real conditions. In the more than three-year eco2jet demonstration phase from May 2018 to August 2021, the air conditioning system with CO2 as refrigerant proved to be a reliable and technologically mature concept. The environmentally friendly, energy-saving regular operation of an ÖBB long-distance passenger train with this pioneering technology on board is thus guaranteed and Liebherr has further consolidated its status as an expert in air conditioning systems with natural refrigerants."

182 metre-high skyscraper: New Liebherr crane at work in Canada ,Press releases |08/03/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/182-metre-high-skyscraper-new-liebherr-crane-at-work-in-canada.html?page=33,"Fast working speed, simple operation and reliable service – these are the key factors that prompted Liebherr customer Cambie Forming Ltd. to opt for another 280 HC-L 12/24 Litronic.Find out more",Press releases,08/03/2022,"“The 280 HC-L is an extremely reliable and responsive crane. It’s by far the best crane I’ve worked with in my 25-year professional career,” says crane operator Richard Out. Two technologies impress him in particular: Micromove and level luffing at the push of a button. These functions have helped him, for example, to place concrete formwork panels with millimetre precision. Plus, he has an unrestricted view of loads from inside the modern LiCAB crane operator’s cab, which also features an ergonomic control stand.The 280 HC-L in the version with its maximum 24-tonne load capacity is helping to build Hillside East Tower 1 to a final height of 182 metres. The skyscraper is part of a neighbourhood development project in the city Burnaby in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Several buildings are being constructed in the Brentwood district to accommodate residential and retail units as well as cafés and restaurants. At the same time, a Liebherr 355 HC-L 16/32 Litronic is working on Hillside East Tower 2. The building is to be 142 metres high. Two further skyscrapers, directly adjacent to the Hillside East Towers, have now been completed. These were also successfully erected with the help of two Liebherr 280 HC-Ls.. High-performance lifting and horizontal luffing HC-L series cranes are optimally designed for use on tall buildings. They’re easy to assemble on tight construction sites and feature in-house manufactured high-performance drives. To ensure the appropriate handling capacity, the cranes also offer straightforward load hook re-reeving from one to two-line operation. The level luffing function makes work easier for the crane operator and ensures safe and efficient operation on site. When the jib moves, the control system automatically readjusts the hoist unit so that the load hook travels along a horizontal path.An optimal climbing process is also important for safety and efficiency on the construction site. The 280 HC-L crane climbs up the building just like its 355 HC-L neighbour. The construction site’s layout proved a challenge in this respect. Both cranes could only be assembled in one place, as site operations would have been disrupted otherwise. Liebherr's Tower Crane Solutions project department, together with Cambie Forming Ltd, developed an optimal climbing process to minimise the loads on the building and the crane guy wires. Despite these challenges, only six guys were needed to safely climb the cranes to the great heights.. Collaboration you can count onCustomer Cambie Forming Ltd appreciates the package combination of high-performance equipment and comprehensive crane services. “We’ve owned Liebherr products for more than 15 years and have complete confidence in the reliability, quality of manufacturing and usability of these cranes as well as the provided customer service,” says managing director Peter Betz.Purchasing the new 280 HC-L for the construction project in Burnaby has paid, “As far as we are concerned, 280 HC-L cranes have the best lifting and luffing speeds out there, they also offer impressive lifting capacities and are flexible when it comes to assembly.” The new 280 HC-L’s current job is expected to last until November this year. The 355 HC-L is scheduled to be disassembled in October.The general contractor Cambie Forming Ltd is based in Vancouver and is a long-standing Liebherr customer. In addition to HC-L series cranes, the company also has top-slewing cranes from Liebherr’s HC, EC-B and EC-H series in its portfolio..

Alpine crane job on constricted site,Press releases |08/02/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/alpine-crane-job-on-constricted-site.html?page=33,A Liebherr LR 11000 crawler crane has installed a 176-tonne railway bridge not far from the fashionable spa and holiday resort of St. Moritz in the Swiss canton of Graubünden.Find out more,Press releases,08/02/2022,"Michael Egger, Managing Director of Emil Egger AG, based in St. Gallen, transported his 1,000-tonne crawler crane to the south-east of Switzerland to replace three railway bridges, all of which were around 100 years old. Work on the first bridge structure was particularly challenging – due to the limited space available for the crane on a metalled embankment facing the adjacent road, it was not possible to use the derrick boom with its suspended ballast.. ""To ensure we have sufficient stability for lifting the new, significantly heavier railway bridge, we had to maximise the central ballast on the crane to compensate for the lack of suspended ballast,"" explains Egger, who planned the operation with his colleague, Andreas Schönenberger. Prior to carrying out the work, he had discussed the load case in this unusual configuration with the specialists at Liebherr in Ehingen: ""The LR 11000 is equipped with 90 tonnes of central ballast as standard. We have therefore packed 130 tonnes into the crane for this operation after Liebherr gave us the OK to do so."" The slewing platform ballast was loaded with the maximum counterweight of 250 tonnes.. ""Up to the limit of the load chart""Before the new steel structure, which is around 35 metres long and was assembled on site from several segments, could be placed in position, the old bridge structure first had to be removed. The 65-tonne truss construction was quickly lifted off the abutments and set down on the edge of the mountain river, actually next to LR 11000. It was then repositioned later for removal. Afterwards, the crawler crane was able to lift the new bridge from the special transporter on the road and position it above the river using a radius of around 22 metres. ""With this radius and a gross load case of 205 tonnes, we are almost at the limit of the load chart for the crane in this particular configuration,"" says Egger.. The LR 11000 was erected and dismantled by a Liebherr LTM 1250-6.1 mobile crane belonging to Sabesa SA, a crane and haulage contractor based in Ticino. Andrea Saccomandi, Managing Director of Sabesa, which was actually the main contractor for the replacement of the three railway bridges, was personally on site for the crane job. Based on the northern shore of Lake Maggiore, the company's portfolio includes crane work, transport services and platform hire, and its fleet includes around a dozen Liebherr mobile, compact and mobile construction cranes..

The cranes complement Poloniato's fleet in the range between 100 and 160 tonnes lifting capacity.LTM 1110-5.1: high mobility worldwide and long telescopic boom""We chose the LTM 1110-5.1 because of some of its fundamental features: the ability to take 13.4 tonnes of counterweight on board, the 60-metre telescopic boom and the VarioBase® Plus support system,"" explains Michele Poloniato, owner of Poloniato S.r.l. With its 60-metre telescopic boom, the LTM 1110-5.1 offers one of the longest booms in this class of crane and this combined with powerful lifting capacities. Various extensions with folding tips or lattice pieces are possible for the telescopic boom. The 5-axle model also features a variety of different driving conditions – thereby ensuring major advantages for road travel worldwide. The innovative VarioBase® Plus gives the crane's support even more power and safety. The rear supports have a double-stage design and achieve a support width of 8.3 metres, 1.3 metres wider than the front supports. This increases the load-bearing forces over the rear supports even more. Poloniato S.r.l. plans to use the LTM 1110-5.1 mainly for erecting and dismantling tower cranes.LTM 1150-5.3: high load capacities in steep position and large radius""Size and performance are in excellent proportion in the LTM 1150-5.3. It offers a 66-metre telescopic boom. What is also special is the possibility to drive on public roads with nine tonnes of counterweight,"" Michele Poloniato explains the decision for the LTM 1150-5.3. The single-engine strategy with mechanical drive of the superstructure eliminates weight there, which is used for the longer boom and more lifting capacity. This allows the 5-axle crane to do many jobs without extra counterweight transport. This makes it quickly ready for use on the construction site and saves costs. Its 66-metre telescopic boom lifts loads weighing over nine tonnes when fully extended. That makes it perfect for erecting tower cranes. This is also the main area of application for the mobile crane at Poloniato. The crane will also be used in the assembly of prefabricated elements made of reinforced concrete for industrial buildings. The Liebherr-150-tonne crane can achieve hoisting heights of up to 92 metres and radii up to 72 metres using lattice extensions.Good technical support and fast spare parts serviceLiebherr's service also contributed to the decision to buy. ""The fast service and excellent support from Liebherr-Italia technicians, the rapid delivery of spare parts and an efficient workshop in Monfalcone have allowed the long-standing relationship with Liebherr to grow,"" explains Michele Poloniato.Over 23 years of cooperation with Liebherr""Our Liebherr mobile cranes are certainly among the best in the world in terms of performance, value and image,"" Poloniato enthuses. The cooperation between Poloniato and Liebherr has existed for over 23 years. ""We have been working with Liebherr since 1998 and during this time we have purchased a total of 11 new and used cranes,"" says Poloniato. More than half of the Italian company's mobile cranes come from Liebherr.The Italian crane company Poloniato S.r.l. was founded in 1973. The 30 employees work with the machines in Poloniato's fleet on up to 200 construction sites a year. The Italian crane company is particularly well positioned with machines in the medium load range. The areas of application range from the assembly of construction and hall cranes, to cable car masts and air conditioning systems, to moving loads..

170 metre office tower – Liebherr cranes involved in construction of “To‑Lyon”,Press releases |07/28/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/170-metre-office-tower-liebherr-cranes-involved-in-construction-of-to-lyon.html?page=33,"A 170 metre building, little space and heavy hoists – four Liebherr tower cranes finished in aircraft warning paintwork are helping to redevelop the Part-Dieu district in Lyon, France.Find out more",Press releases,07/28/2022,"The cranes used for the project, which is located right next to Lyon central station, are the 420 EC-H 16, 280 EC-H 12, 280 EC-H 16 and 250 EC-B 12. The most striking building in the redevelopment of Part-Dieu is the “To‑Lyon”, a skyscraper with a height of 170 metres. On completion, the building will have a total floor area of 80,000 square metres for offices, businesses and a hotel. New buildings, more space for nature and networked mobility – these are just some of the measures that the district will use to make itself more attractive to residents and visitors.. Precision tailoring of tower and jib to the site conditionsThe hook height and jib length of the top-slewing cranes were selected so that the machines can slew over each other without causing problems for each other despite the small amount of space available. This is exactly what the cranes in the ECB and EC H series were developed for because the jib length and tower heights can be tailored flexibly to the situation on a site. The jibs on the four cranes working at the site are between 30 and 65 metres in length. Their hook heights are between 47 and 194 metres.The 420 EC-H 16 will reach a final hook height 194 metres. A stable tower system and a sophisticated concept for guying to the building are what make this enormous hook height possible for the erection of the “To-Lyon”. This is because the guying systems have different lengths as the construction work progresses. Initially longer struts will be used, and then shorter ones. The reason for this is that the crane had to be anchored at a time when the final concrete façade was not finished. This enabled the crane to be erected without jeopardising the whole site timetable.. Precise positioning of concrete and steelThe cranes are mainly being used to help install steel elements and for concreting work. Some of the loads being hoisted way more than twelve tonnes. The Micromove assistance system can be a real benefit for these hoists. Micromove enables crane operators to position heavy loads with fingertip precision and is just one of several assistance systems which are available. Litronic, Liebherr’s smart assistant, is designed to support crane operators in their work and also increase handling capacity, reliability and safety.. Using LiUP to get up to the required height at the touch of a buttonAll the cranes on the French site feature the LiUP crane operator elevator. Liebherr’s LiUP crane operator elevator is designed to transport two people or a payload of 200 kilogrammes. The crane operator gets to his workplace quickly and safely at the touch of a button. It also means that erection engineers no longer have to face an energy-sapping, time-consuming climb. The LiUP elevator is tailored to Liebherr tower systems and only requires one-time installation. The rails can be left in the tower system during the erection and dismantling processes.The site is now so far advanced that the 250 EC-B 12 has been dismantled. The 420 EC-H 16 helped to carry out this work. Thanks to its easy-erection design, the EC-B crane was dismantled within a single day. LiConnect quick-release connections and the compact head with the slewing platform, cabin and switchgear cabinet ensure that the cranes can be dismantled and erected quickly and safely. Smooth dismantling was helpful in this particular project because the remaining cranes were able to restart their work quickly. The “To‑Lyon” is scheduled to be completed in spring 2023..

Liebherr Transportation Systems (China) will provide services and support via Liebherr’s local established presence in the region."
Herkules strengthens crane fleet with Liebherr-LG 1750 lattice boom mobile crane,Press releases |07/26/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/herkules-strengthens-crane-fleet-with-liebherr-lg-1750-lattice-boom-mobile-crane.html?page=33,The Polish crane and heavy transport company Herkules S.A. has taken delivery of a new LG 1750. The lattice boom mobile crane offers the flexibility of a 750-tonne crawler crane combined with the high mobility of a mobile crane. Herkules is extending the performance range of its crane capacities upwardswith the LG 1750.Find out more,Press releases,07/26/2022,"With the acquisition of an LG 1750, the Polish crane company Herkules S.A. has expanded its crane range upwards in the heavy-duty sector. Consideration of what was available on the crane market and the requirements of the company's customers led to the decision in favour of the Liebherr lattice boom mobile crane. For Herkules, it is also particularly important that Liebherr is present in Poland with good service availability: ""Our confidence in Liebherr products, their high availability and reliable service led us to choose a Liebherr crane,"" explains Pawel Maciejak, Director of the Crawler Cranes and Wind Energy Division at Herkules.Symbiosis of two worldsThe LG 1750 lattice boom mobile crane has the flexibility of a 750-tonne crawler crane combined with the mobility of a high speed mobile crane. That means it combines the benefits of these two crane types in a single concept. This makes it the largest and strongest lattice boom mobile crane in the world and unrivalled in the market. ""The high mobility and carrying capacity were decisive factors for the purchase of the new LG 1750,"" states Maciejak. Having the chassis of an all-terrain crane, the bottom part of the 8-axle crane is self-driving to any application site. Compared to a crawler crane, this reduces transport vehicles, thereby saving times and costs. Its vehicle width of less than three metres is a great advantage. This chassis combined with a strong lattice boom of a crawler crane makes the crane particularly powerful. The components can also be transported economically thanks to the transport weight of less than 45 tonnes.That makes the compact lattice boom mobile crane ideal for fast erection work for wind power, industrial construction or infrastructure work. There is a large selection of boom configurations for the LG 1750 which have been specially enhanced for deployment in the wind industry. The latest generation of wind turbines with hub heights of up to 170 metres can be erected using the SX system. At Herkules, too, the main area of application for the new 8-axle is in the wind segment.The Polish crane and heavy transport company Herkules S.A. offers the rental of lifting and transport services. Herkules' wide-ranging fleet has around 300 tower, mobile and lattice boom cranes in various load classes. With almost 200 employees, the company therefore operates from its headquarters and several branches, mainly in Poland. The core areas are in general construction, energy and telecommunications. In addition to renting mobile and crawler cranes as well as tower cranes, Herkules carries out construction, assembly and electrical work, undertakes road transport for oversized goods and is involved in the installation and assembly of wind turbines..

"""Perfect in halls"": LTC 1050-3.1 is impressive indoors too",Press releases | 07/20/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/perfect-in-halls-ltc-1050-is-impressive-indoors-too.html?page=34,"Liebherr also offers its LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane in a boom variant with rapid rope pull technology. This provides an alternative to the variant with conventional TELEMATIK fast-cycle telescoping system, which is ideally suited, among other things, for use in narrow or low production or exhibition halls. The boom can be telescoped to a length of 31 metres.Find out more",Press releases,07/20/2022,"""Especially indoors, the crane is really perfect."" This assessment comes from someone who should know: Crane driver Steffen Wolf has been sitting on one of the three new LTC 1050-3.1 models with rope pull technology that the company ordered from the Liebherr factory in Ehingen for the Düsseldorf branch of Wasel for a few months now. The expert crane driver set up and dismantled the heavy components of a machinery fair in the Ruhr area with his brand new 3-axle model and two other colleagues on the same type of crane. Exhibits or plant components weighing up to 17 tonnes had to be moved or loaded.Even when setting up the exhibits, the men were on site for almost a week to fill the exhibition stands with the exhibitors' heavy equipment in a very tight space. ""We didn't have much space. We were only able to drive through the often narrow alleys to the operation sites and work there because of the compact design of the crane,"" adds Marino Castellini. ""The individual support of the crane with VarioBase® was almost always necessary in the process."" He has also been working with one of Wasel's new rope pull LTCs for six months.. A clear overview ensures safetyWith its slim width of 2.55 metres, the LTC 1050-3.1 can get through almost anywhere. After all, there are heavy loads to lift even in the farthest corners of the exhibition halls. Its fast and flexible readiness for use, as well as the possibility of telescoping large crates of material or heavier exhibits to large radii, make the crane an ideal and efficient helper for the varied handling work in exhibition construction. The liftable crane cab also plays a particularly important role. Large scaffolding with lighting systems hanging from the hall ceilings and other height-limiting fixtures demand the utmost attention and precision from the crane drivers when moving the loads. Here, the control cab of the LTC 1050-3.1 – which can be telescoped to a height of over seven metres – ensures a high level of safety. Whether loading onto large trucks or manoeuvring the pulley head close to obstacles and interfering edges – the best view of what is happening is always guaranteed.. Minimum space requirement with steeply positioned lift cabThe flexible compact crane with strong telescopic boom from Liebherr is made for jobs in such confined environments on the ground and in the room. ""No other crane comes close,"" praises Steffen Wolf. ""I really enjoy working with it here. Wolf often raised his liftable cab in the exhibition halls, sometimes tilting it forward as well. ""The work can be done more safely and often faster as a result. Even the trucks don't necessarily have to open the side tarpaulins any more, because I can see what's happening from above when I'm loading,"" he explains. People are often surprised at how little space the LTC 1050-3.1 takes up. When recently used for a roofer, it was eyed sceptically because when the crane was set up, everyone thought that there was not enough space there for the slewing operation. ""But when I lifted the cab steeply upwards, slewing through was possible without any problems."". Thanks to its compact design, Wasel also regularly uses its LTC 1050-3.1 in the confined spaces of refineries. ""Its erection jibs make the machine an ideal tool in the chemical industry and for industrial assemblies,"" explains Julian Schmidt, Head of Heavy Load Logistics at the large transport and crane service provider. ""In addition to the three units with the rope extension, we have another five LTC 1050-3.1 units with conventional TELEMATIK booms in our fleet."".

Liebherr-EMtec GmbH drives digitisation forward together with customers,Press releases |07/19/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-emtec-gmbh-drives-digitisation-forward-together-with-customers.html?page=34,"Digitisation is one of the defining megatrends in the construction and material handling technology industry. Liebherr-EMtec GmbH is helping to shape technological progress and, as part of its digitisation strategy, is working with customers to develop solutions that will enable them to carry out construction projects more economically, efficiently and safely in the future.Find out more",Press releases,07/19/2022,"Part of the digitisation strategy at Liebherr-EMtec GmbH covers digital, machine-oriented solutions for the optimisation of fleets in both operational and strategic terms. Liebherr actively involves customers in the development of these solutions from the start and takes into consideration their individual challenges and problems.. Analysis of current challenges in the construction and material handling technology industryLiebherr experts conducted extensive interviews in order to gain an even deeper insight into the industry-specific challenges facing customers today. Discussions with customers and Liebherr sales and service partners of varying sizes and orientations, concluded that very different business segments often encounter similar challenges. It appears that construction site processes or projects cannot always be optimally coordinated due to missing or outdated machine information and data. This leads to inefficient machine deployment, which in turn can result in high costs and delays in project execution.Henri Backhaus, workshop foreman at Reinhard Feickert GmbH, has the following to report: ""Sometimes it was the case that a component had to be replaced urgently on site resulting in unplanned machine downtime. If we had been able to keep an eye on this beforehand, the exchange could have taken place within the framework of one of the planned inspections.""Daniel Weis, Business Unit Manager ""Mobile processing & recycling plants"" at Weimer Group, states that it would be an advantage to have more in-depth insights into the performance data of the machines. For example, what the machine utilisation is during a certain project and the level of fuel consumption.Olaf Jansen, Head of Machine Technology Department at Friedrich Vorwerk SE & Co. KG, adds that there is a lack of a cross-manufacturer approach: ""Because companies of our size generally have large machine fleets from a number of manufacturers, a platform where my entire fleet, including attachments, is visible and with all relevant information would be the optimal solution.""Practical development within the framework of lead customer partnershipFor Liebherr the integration of the customer in the development of digital solutions, which should offer customers added value over the long term, is of vital importance. Liebherr-EMtec GmbH implements this within the framework of the lead customer partnership, which started at the beginning of 2021. Meetings with selected lead customers take place regularly in order to obtain their feedback and test new rolled-out functions. The feedback from customers, new ideas and prioritised requirements are then included in the development.Eugen Schobesberger, Managing Director of Technology at Liebherr-EMtec GmbH, summarises: ""We also consistently embody our strategy 'From market to market' in digitisation. Our customers are involved in the development as active partners from the initial idea to the current state of the product. As a result, the solution is optimally tailored to the needs of our customers and they can focus more on their core technologies."". A customer-oriented platform for location-independent performance analysis and condition monitoringThe aim of the IoT platform is to give customers an overview of their entire machine fleet. In combination with AI-assisted recommendations for action, in future the Liebherr solution will represent a fundamental, future-oriented instrument for increasing efficiency.Together with those in the lead customer partnership, Liebherr-EMtec GmbH develops a digital customer-oriented solution, which should enable the location-independent performance analysis and condition monitoring of earthmoving machines and material handlers. With the aim of providing customers with relevant practical knowledge so they can manage the machine fleet and attachments with maximum reliability and productivity.With the aid of a condition analysis, unplanned machine downtime should be reduced in the future as well as the time required for problem identification, assessment and solution. This frees up valuable technical resources, especially in times of increasing skill shortages. In addition it will be possible to identify inefficient machine deployments at a glance in the future thanks to the performance analysis. This is supplemented by direct optimisation suggestions, which lower operating costs and make activities more efficient.Direct links to Liebherr world and customer production processIn the course of the digitisation strategy Liebherr-EMtec GmbH not only develops smart earthmoving machines and material handlers as well as attachments but aims to link these directly with the customer's production process. The solution should connect manufacturers, service partners and operators on one platform. With the aim of being a central interface in order to ensure a high level of availability and operating efficiency as well as short communication channels. The special feature of the solution is that machines from other manufacturers can also be included and managed in the application in the future. Third-party machines are integrated via standard interfaces, whereas attachments from other manufacturers are integrated via specific trackers.As a vertically integrated technology group, Liebherr delivers further added value to its customers through the precise coordination of components and attachments through to the complete machine. For a consistent customer experience and direct points of connection to the Liebherr world the platform will be anchored in the digital landscape in the future: the digital platform will be integrated into the existing Liebherr portal for all services – ""My Liebherr"". This means that more synergies are created and the spare part orders can be processed in the same system.Modular structure for flexible and needs-based useThe machine fleet can be managed in an aggregated view. Customers have all relevant information in their sight. Through the modular structure customers can order machine-oriented digital solutions in one platform as needed and extend them flexibly at any time. Via customizable views as well as configurable notifications customers can flexibly define which information they need and when they request a notification..

The LTC 1050-3.1 is already the third LTC compact crane that the company from Thema in southern Thuringia has taken over. The LTM 1160-5.2 complements the Henneberger fleet in the strong 5-axle class.Find out more",Press releases,07/18/2022,"Henneberger Schwerlast remains true to its strategy of procuring only Liebherr mobile cranes in the telescopic crane sector. Mario Henneberger, owner of the second-generation family business, explains: ""We have aligned ourselves with one manufacturer and thus achieved complete flexibility in personnel deployment. With Liebherr, we appreciate the uniform crane control, from small to large cranes. This allows us to make optimum use of our driving personnel in times of shortage of skilled workers and also to easily bridge downtimes due to vacation or illness. Liebherr's service is also exemplary, solving problems quickly and thus significantly reducing downtime."". Quality and comfort relieve crane driversThe main catchment areas of Henneberger Schwerlast e.K. are central and southern Thuringia and northern Bavaria. The company attaches great importance to creating good working conditions for its personnel: ""You have to do something for your people, because the job places high demands on the operator. That's why we provide material to take the strain off them in both driving and crane operation. High product quality also avoids downtime, reducing stress for operators and dispatch personnel alike.""Henneberger already has good experience with Liebherr LTC compact cranes. The new LTC 1050-3.1 is already the third unit the company has purchased in recent years. ""The manoeuvrability and travel characteristics of the LTC are excellent. In addition, Liebherr has further improved the crane in many details, for example the assembly jip with roller set and hook traverse. Various cameras make the operator's work easier and more pleasant,"" says Mario Henneberger. He opted for the 36-meter TELEMATIK boom version, where the telescopic parts are bolted together. ""We use the LTC 1050-3.1 as a universal machine. It doesn't just do indoor jobs for us."". Powerful crane for precast parts and heavy machineryThe LTM 1160-5.2 strengthens Henneberger's fleet in the upper 5-axle class. Complementing the LTM 1250-5.1, the company's largest crane, the new crane will be used in the assembly of precast concrete parts and heavy machinery, for example in the automotive industry. The Thuringia region also has a long tradition of glass production. So the LTM 1160-5.2 will also find jobs in this industry.Mario Henneberger also cites the adjustable ballast radius VarioBallast® and the variable support base VarioBase® as important decision criteria.

New 300 EC-B 12 Fibre and 270 EC-B 12: EC-B series from Liebherr continues to grow ,Press releases |07/15/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-300-ec-b-12-fibre-and-270-ec-b-12-ec-b-series-from-liebherr-continues-to-grow.html?page=34,"Liebherr is expanding its successful series of flat-top cranes with the new 300 EC-B 12 Fibre and 270 EC-B 12. Both machines are ideal for sites requiring heavy hoists and meet all the main requirements placed on a modern crane fleet. Erection, transport and operation – the new members of the “Tough Guys” group deliver outstanding features in every respect. The flat-top cranes are available to order now.Find out more",Press releases,07/15/2022,"Biberach (Riss) (Germany), 15 July 2022 – The 300 EC-B 12 Fibre features the Liebherr fibre rope and therefore delivers significantly better performance values than similar cranes with a steel rope. The fibre rope also has a much longer service life which means that the rope has to be changed less frequently. That makes operation even more economical and increases the crane’s availability. The 300 EC B 12 Fibre has a 70 metre jib and delivers a lifting capacity at the jib head of 3250 kilograms. The steel rope version of the 270 EC-B 12 with a 70 metre jib has a lifting capacity at the jib head of 2850 kilograms. Powerful hoist units and pure 2 line operation make both machines particularly efficient. The new cranes will replace the existing Liebherr 250 EC-B and 278 EC-B Fibre models.. Fast, safe erectionThe “Tough Guys” have been designed for simple transport and erection, which also delivers major cost benefits for rental businesses. The counter-jib, slewing platform and jib segments can be carried to the site in just four transport units due to their smart stacking system. This also makes a major contribution to reducing greenhouse gases. The jib and counter-jib can be attached to the slewing platform easily, conveniently and safely. This is all made possible by Liebherr’s time-tested quick-release connectors. Depending on the requirements at the site, the jib can be extended or reduced in 2.5 metre sections.Both machines have a 21 HC 290 tower connection. This tower system, which measures 2.1 x 2.1 metres, is the perfect choice in terms of performance and economy. It enables a maximum free-standing hook height of 71.5 metres. The 24 HC 630 (dimensions: 2.4 x 2.4 metres) enables a maximum free-standing hook height of 91.7 metres to be achieved.Everything in clear sight – the crane cabin with TC-OSTo ensure safe crane operation, it is essential that the crane operator has a perfect view of the crane and site at all times. The LiCAB crane operator’s cabin features an ergonomic control stand and large glass windows which deliver perfect visibility. The cabin also includes the newly developed 12 inch display with its intuitive control concept. The Tower Crane Operating System (TC-OS) provides crane operators and erection engineers with special menus, a large selection of languages and readily understandable dimension units. Furthermore, smart assistance systems such as Load Plus (up to 20 percent increase in lifting capacity), Micromove (fine positioning of loans) and ABB (operating-range limiting system) support the crane operator and enable him to hoist loads safely.. The 300 EC-B 12 Fibre and 270 EC-B 12 fit seamlessly into the successful group of “Tough Guys” with their strong performance, flexibility and economy. From a small city crane to a large handling expert – EC-B cranes cover a wide range of operations. And due to their design, multiple flat-top cranes can operate on constricted sites without any problems.Technical data for the 300 EC-B 12 Fibre and 270 EC-B 12:Maximum jib length: up to 73 metresMaximum lifting capacity: 12 tonnesLifting capacity at the jib head (70 metres): 3250 kilograms (300 EC-B 12 Fibre)2850 kilograms (270 EC-B 12)Free-standing hook height: up to 91.7 metres with the 24 HC 630 tower systemup to 71.5 metres with the 21 HC 290 tower system.

200 tonnes on the hook – MaxiKraft installs crane girder using LR 11000,Press releases |07/14/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/200-tonnes-on-the-hook-maxikraft-installs-crane-girder-using-lr-11000.html?page=34,"Immediately after completing its first job erecting a wind turbine, a new Liebherr LR 11000 crawler crane owned by crane and heavy haulage contractor MaxiKraft had the opportunity to show its capabilities at a steel casting plant. The 1000 tonne crawler crane installed a 200 tonne crane girder, which had been completely repurposed, at ThyssenKrupp in Duisburg.Find out more",Press releases,07/14/2022,"Ehingen (Donau) (Germany), 14 July 2022 – After its very first job erecting a wind turbine in southern Brandenburg, the Liebherr LR 11000 was transported around 600 kilometres to Duisburg by more than 30 heavy haulage vehicles. A 200 tonne crane girder for a former casting gantry crane measuring 40 metres in length had to be installed at a ThyssenKrupp steel casting plant. These girders are designed to transport hot liquid steel inside the plant.. In constricted space conditions, the LR 11000 had to be set up with 50 tonnes of central ballast, 170 tonnes of slewing platform ballast and 320 tonnes of derrick ballast within four days in its SL11DBV configuration with a 102 metre main boom and a 42 metre derrick boom. The hoist was completed on a Saturday so that the crane could then be dismantled again from the Monday and the steel plant could quickly restart operations.. LR 11000 – powerful and compactCrane operator Marcel Kallwass is full of praise for both the crane and his team: “The delivery of the crane components was a logistical master class. Things were very tight, particularly when setting up the crane. But everything actually went very well. The LR 11000 is a fantastic crane. I’ve operated them all, from the LR 1600/2 to the LR 11350 and also large machines from other manufacturers.”An SPMT module vehicle manoeuvred the colossal steel component from the preparation area to the crane where the LR 11000 picked it up on four giant shackles and then delicately placed the 200 tons at its assembly position at a lofty height. The 1000 tonne crane even had to move a few metres with the massive load on its hook. Thick excavator mats had been put in position specially to distribute the load.The old crane girder has been modified for its new purpose as a weather guard. Over the next few months, a mobile safety wall will be attached to it to provide the open building which houses the extrusion casting system with better protection from wind and rain..

Long boom and high lifting capacities convince – LTM 1230-5.1 for Soliman,Press releases |06/23/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/long-boom-and-high-lifting-capacities-convince-ltm-1230-5-1-for-soliman.html?page=35,"French crane contractor Soliman has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1230-5.1 mobile crane. The higher lifting capacities of the powerful, versatile 5-axle crane compared to other models in the same crane class, together with its particularly long boom, were just some of the criteria which made up the company’s mind to buy the new crane.Find out more",Press releases,06/23/2022,"French crane contractor has taken delivery of a new LTM 1230-5.1. One of the factors which persuaded the company to buy the Liebherr 5-axle model was its high resale value on the second hand market. Soliman is also delighted with the reliability of Liebherr cranes: “We chose Liebherr when we decided to develop our fleet as a result of the reliability of Liebherr cranes and the fact that they often deliver higher lifting capacities compared to others in the same crane class”, explains Enzo Gigante, Commercial Manager at Soliman.Powerful, versatile crane with a long boom“We decided on the LTM 1230-5.1 from Liebherr because of its great boom length, versatility and high performance”, continues Gigante. The 230 tonne model features a very long 75 metre telescopic boom. This can also be combined with a 43 metre fixed jib. That makes high radii possible, for example for hoisting loads over buildings. Its maximum hoist height is 111 metres. In addition, there is a wide range of auxiliary boom systems available for this crane model, which can be adjusted hydraulically as an option.Operating in constricted conditions possible thanks to VarioBase®The LTM 1230-5.1 also sets new standards in terms of lifting capacity. Its VarioBase® and VarioBallast® features ensure that it is also ideal for working in constricted conditions. The LTM 1230-5.1 was the very first crane to feature an asymmetrical support system, known as VarioBase® Plus. This combines trapezoidal support with VarioBase® technology. It means that even higher lifting capacities are possible, particularly over the crane’s rear outriggers.The Liebherr LTM 1230-5.1 is ideal for working fully raised and at great hook heights, for example for erecting tower cranes or maintenance work for wind turbines. The Soliman team is active both in industry and on construction sites. The new LTM 1230-5.1 joins the higher lifting capacity segment within the Soliman crane fleet. “The crane fits perfectly in the heavy load cranes within our fleet”, adds Gigante.Soliman was founded in 1984 in the French city of Lille. Today, the company has two other outlets on the coast and in Picardie. That means that Soliman has a presence throughout the Hauts-de-France region. The company has a workforce of around 40 employees and now has a fleet of 26 cranes, over half of which have been supplied by Liebherr. “We work in every sector where a crane is required, such as construction and general industry. Our employees are passionate and each of them has their own strengths and specialities.”. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr presents its new mixing plant generation at Bauma,Press releases |06/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-presents-its-new-mixing-plant-generation-at-bauma.html?page=35,Liebherr has been developing and supplying mixing plants for concrete production for more than 60 years. All of this experience has now been incorporated into the new development of an innovative modular system.Find out more,Press releases,06/21/2022,"The new Betomix and Mobilmix mixing plant series can be flexibly combined using prefabricated modules and replace several predecessor series. For the customer, this means: More freedom when configuring the plants, shorter delivery times, faster assembly and increased parts availability. Improvements to the drive also reduce current consumption by up to 30 % and increase weighing accuracy, so that up to 7.5 kg of cement can be saved per cubic metre of concrete.Reaching your goal faster with modulesThe new concept is based on a consistently implemented modular design. Individual modules can be planned and manufactured independently of each other and combined with other modules. They are almost completely wired and fully assembled at Liebherr. After testing, the modules are delivered as complete transport units to the construction site. Cost effective transport: The module dimensions are optimised and are maximum three metres wide. This makes special transports superfluous for almost all plant variants. Due to their innovative folding concept and plug connections, the modules can be quickly and efficiently assembled and put into operation at the construction site.One concept for many solutionsEverything fits together: Depending on the customer’s requirements and use, mixer systems can be installed in the same basic system. Liebherr uses its own twin-shaft or ring-pan mixers. Output rates of 100 to 210 m³ of compacted fresh concrete per hour are possible. Multiple optional accessories can be integrated without additional effort. Various storage facilities for the aggregates can be incorporated, such as a tower silo. Even the optional winter cladding is standardised for all variants. Everything can be combined.The frequency converter ensures improved energy and resource efficiencyFor energy savings of up to 30 %, the frequency converters control the drives for the mixer and charger elevator and optimise the mixing process as a whole. Hybrid mixing processes and shorter mixing times are easy to implement, avoiding power peaks. Also wear is considerably reduced due to the soft starting and soft stopping of the drives. It is the frequency converters however that offer the greatest and most important potential in the dosing of cement with an accuracy of +/- 0.5 %. With a typical recipe with 300 kg of cement per cubic metre of concrete, up to 7.5 kg of cement can be saved - which is an important argument for the new mixing plant generation from an ecological and financial point of view.Mobile designThe mobile design of the new mixing plant generation is marketed under the name of Mobilmix. Thanks to the practical modules, it can be moved to another construction site very quickly. Customers can decide for themselves to what extent the mixing plant should be mobile. The following versions are possible for mobile use: Steel foundation, integrated technical container for wiring at the factory, a mobile in-line silo on steel foundations inclusive of folding chamber walls and mobile cement silo, also on steel foundations. The plant can be optionally equipped with a mobile cladding. The mobile version is also available from 2023.Vertical skipAn example of the modular construction is the skip. It can be simply “hung” on the respective mixing plant, regardless of the required plant performance. Different height levels of the aggregate storage are easier to realize with the vertical skip than with an inclined construction. Due to the vertical construction, up to 20 % less space is required for the installation area. The elevator is designed as a structurally separate element and can be used with the stationary and mobile versions of the new mixing plants.Comfortable work thanks to the well thought-out space conceptAll accessible areas of the mixing plant are generously sized and offer sufficient space, ensuring simplified maintenance and cleaning. There is also enough space for the arrangement of additional containers, such as for steel fiber dosage. A chain hoist can be installed on the weighing platform which can be used to lift Euro pallets with loads of up to 1,000 kg to the appropriate working level through the material hatches. Headroom was also improved in the entire inner area. All stairs and steps are one metre wide as standard. The completely revised mixer high-pressure cleaning system “LiClean”, together with the ""creep speed"" cleaning mode, enables optimum cleaning results with a high level of safety. Furthermore, upon request, there is an automatic cleaning system for the truck mixer feeding hopper. Liebherr customers have already been able to be impressed by the LiClean cleaning system, saving much water and time.Highest qualityThe fully galvanised modules have a long service life and are very robust. The modules are pre-wired at the factory. Q-gates are used to check and document the quality requirements of the respective assembly steps. The plug-in modules can be immediately connected at the construction site. Smooth start-up is guaranteed due to the tested modules..

For the construction site of the future – Liebherr unveils new tower cranes and digital solutions,News |06/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/for-the-construction-site-of-the-future-liebherr-unveils-new-tower-cranes-and-digital-solutions.html?page=35,Liebherr will unveil its first large cranes featuring a fibre rope and its first hydraulic luffing jib crane at the construction machinery show in Munich. Whether they are for enormous hook heights or particularly constricted sites – these new cranes enhance Liebherr’s reputation as a reliable partner on sites of all types.Find out more,News,06/21/2022,"When it launched its pioneering fibre rope over three years ago, Liebherr also unveiled its first fibre cranes in its popular EC-B series. Flat-top cranes featuring a high-tensile fibre rope, which is the result of 10 years of development work by Liebherr and rope manufacturer Teufelberger, are now showing what they can do every day on sites around the world. Now Liebherr is taking the next logical step – fibre cranes for particularly challenging hook heights and hoists.For the very first time, HC-L and EC-H series cranes will now be available in fibre versions – the crane for special projects, the 1188 EC-H 40 Fibre, and the luffing jib crane, the 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre. The high-tensile fibre rope for large cranes has a diameter of 25 millimetres (previous versions measured 20 and 22 millimetres in diameter). The significant weight difference between a 25 millimetres steel rope and a fibre rope of the same thickness means that the new fibre cranes can be used to build skyscrapers and industrial plants with even greater efficiency. The latest “Tough Guys” from the EC-B series, the 370 EC-B 16 Fibre and the 520 EC-B 20 Fibre, also feature the 25 millimetre fibre rope.. Greater hook heights, better performance, less wear The lighter fibre rope is particularly noticeable on specialist cranes for great hook heights, the HC-L cranes. This is because every metre of additional hook height means that the benefits of this significantly lower rope weight increase. The use of the fibre rope enables the lifting capacities at the jib head to be increased by up to 20 percent compared to the steel rope versions. In addition, the fibre rope delivers a significantly longer service life than a steel rope. As the fibre rope only weighs around one-fifth of a steel rope, it is also significantly easier to handle for erection engineers when reeving the hoist rope. Furthermore, the fibre rope is easier to maintain as it does not require lubrication. That also means that the downtimes of the crane are reduced.What is more, safety during crane operations is palpably increased – the various components of the cover wear at different rates, and the crane operator can see at a glance that the rope has to be replaced at the latest when the red layer under the cover fabric appears. In addition, fibre ropes deliver another method of reducing an ecological footprint. This is due both to the rope material and the fact that it makes it possible to use a lighter crane construction.. First hydraulic luffing jib crane from Liebherr Liebherr will also unveil its first hydraulic luffing jib crane at the construction machinery show in Munich. The 195 HC-LH 6/12 can hoist up to 2550 kilograms at the jib head at its maximum radius. The hydraulic luffing jib crane achieves these fantastic values when combined with the climbable 16 EC tower system whose dimensions of 1.6 x 1.6 metres mean it has a very small footprint and can be transported easily to the site by truck or container. Slimline tower systems, great hook heights, high performance and climbable – this complete package makes Liebherr’s hydraulic luffing jib crane unique.In addition, the hydraulic luffing jib crane also particularly stands out from the crowd due to the fact that it is easy to erect and very simple to transport. In addition, the very small out of operation setting and the facility to control it using the popular Litronic assistance systems such as Micromove, the operating-range limiting system and level luffing are absolutely state of the art.. Smart assistance systems and technologies for even greater safetyThe construction site of the future not only requires powerful machines but also smart digital solutions for crane operations. At the construction machinery show, Liebherr will provide an insight into new planning and analysis tools, such as 3D models for planning a site in detail. A digital site diary helps to analyse the efficiency of the construction machinery in retrospect.Furthermore, Liebherr is working on solutions to improve crane operating even more – firstly in the form of the new intuitive TC-OS control interface and secondly by remote control for tower cranes. The new control interface, which is already in use in many cranes, enables crane operators and service engineers to navigate through a practical menu structure using a touchscreen. The remote control enables the crane operator to control the crane from outside the cab. This means greater flexibility in structuring his working day.Another focus is the development of new assistance systems which support crane operators using intelligent sensors and algorithms and therefore make a major contribution to enhancing safety on site. All these technologies form the basis for the future of crane operations.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Towards emission-free construction sites with Liebherr energy storage systems ,Press releases |06/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/towards-emission-free-construction-sites-with-liebherr-energy-storage-systems.html?page=35,The Liduro Power Port (LPO) is a mobile energy storage system for the supply of construction sites. Hybrid or fully electrically powered construction machinery and equipment can be operated or charged locally emission-free with the mobile energy storage system. The high power density and compact design of the LPO enable efficient and flexible supply to machines and construction sites with a wide range of power requirements. Its constant power output reaches up to 120 kW.Find out more,Press releases,06/21/2022,"Construction sites will see an increasing need for further electrification in the coming years, as local and global climate targets for emission reduction are being imposed on the construction sector worldwide. Construction site operators, therefore, have a dynamically growing demand for energy to supply all-electric and hybrid construction machines with local emissions-free power, in line with the existing and upcoming emissions regulations.The battery-based energy storage system ""Liduro Power Port"" (LPO) enables locally emission-free operation and charging of electrified machines and, thus, supports the reduction of overall emissions in cities. Emissions, such as engine noise, particulate matter, CO2 and others are still primarily caused not only by mobile machinery, but also by diesel generators.Efficiency and market-leading power densityConstruction sites often have limited access to grid supply, sometimes none at all. Therefore, the challenges on electrified construction sites are the operation of machines at maximum power, charging of numerous machines during break times, and smoothing of load peaks. With a current market-leading power and energy density, the LPO offers a highly efficient solution for the mobile supply of machines with a wide range of power and load peaks.Starting from 2024, the series product will be available in various power ranges with up to 120 kW/kWh. It can be charged at up to 32A and deliver power to loads via multiple connections that can be used simultaneously: 16A / 32A / 63A / 125A. The LPO can also be charged and discharged at the same time. The energy and condition monitoring is handled via the local control and, additionally, via a remotely available app for smartphones and tablets.. Economy and mobilityThe energy storage system can supplement an insufficient grid connection or be used as an isolated grid when there’s no available grid connection. By using the LPO as a supplement to the grid connection, the dimensioning of the grid connection power can be significantly reduced, as the energy storage unit covers the load peaks of the machines. In isolated operation, the LPO is a flexible and highly efficient solution: On construction sites, high load peaks and, on the other hand, longer periods with very low power requirements are common - for example, for lighting or small appliances. The mobile energy storage system supplies power on demand and without surplus, offering an optimal price-performance ratio. Compared to a diesel generator, which has a consistently high consumption of fossil energy regardless of its consumers, the LPO delivers power with a significantly higher efficiency and without idle phases.The LPO can be transported to urban or peripherally located construction sites with an optionally available trailer chassis or standard trailers for user-friendly operation. On site, if required, it can be moved by crane or excavator, using suspension points, and lifted and moved from all sides by a forklift. The basic dimensions of the LPO are 2,500 x 1,250 x 900 mm (L x W x H).. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Lightweight to increase capacity – the new fibre rope cranes from Liebherr ,Press releases |06/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/lightweight-to-increase-capacity-the-new-fibre-rope-cranes-from-liebherr.html?page=35,The benefits of fibre rope are particularly noticeable on large cranes because each metre of additional hook height makes the significantly lower rope weight even more noticeable. Liebherr is now extending its fibre crane portfolio with extremely powerful machines – including the EC-B series for the first time.Find out more,Press releases,06/21/2022,"Enormous hook heights, a small footprint and no slewing over neighbouring properties – the construction of high buildings in densely populated city centres often pose these challenges. The new 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre featuring the 25 millimetre fibre rope from Liebherr may be the ideal crane for these projects. This machine is the first luffing jib crane from Liebherr to feature high-tensile fibre rope and delivers some extremely impressive performance values.The 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre reaches similar hook heights to the 230 HC-L 8/16. With a maximum jib length of around 60 metres, the lifting capacity at the jib head is still 2500 kilograms. The 230 HC-L 8/16 with the steel rope version can only manage a maximum of 1900 kilograms at the jib head. Furthermore, the maximum lifting capacity for the 258 HC-L 10/18 Fibre has been increased by 25 percent to ten tonnes, which meets the current market requirements for this size class.These high values are primarily made possible by using the high-tensile fibre rope. The fibre rope is significantly lighter than a steel rope with a comparable diameter. This means that higher lifting capacity values and faster working speeds are possible using a similar crane design and this applies to the complete portfolio of Liebherr fibre cranes. In addition to the fibre rope, the hook block also weighs less.Just like its steel rope version brothers, the 258HC-L 10/18 Fibre can perform level luffing. When moving the load, the control system automatically adjusts the hoist gear so that the load hook is moved horizontally. Sophisticated assistance systems such as Micromove and an ergonomic crane cab mean that crane operators can also carry out heavyweight hoists safely.. 1188 EC-H 40 Fibre with a maximum lifting capacity of 40 tonnesHoists involving heavy weights are also no problem for the new 1188 EC-H 40 Fibre – in fact quite the opposite is true. The new fibre crane will be the most powerful standard crane available from Liebherr. The 1188 EC-H 40 Fibre delivers an impressive maximum lifting capacity of 40 tonnes. A lifting capacity of up to 13,100 kilograms is possible at the jib head with a jib length of 80 metres. This means that the fibre crane beats the extremely powerful steel rope version of the 1000 EC-H by up to two tonnes in terms of its lifting capacity at the jib head. The maximum standard radius of the crane is 90 metres.That makes high-top cranes from Liebherr the perfect choice for handling high lifting capacities. Hoisting prefabricated parts with weights of several tonnes is particularly commonplace in bridge, power station and plant construction. Furthermore, this crane series also features high handling capacity and precision even for hoisting very heavy loads. Various assistance systems in the Litronic control system support the crane operator to deliver even greater safety and productivity.. New “Tough Guys” The cranes in the EC B series are particularly useful on sites with multiple cranes operating simultaneously. Their flat-top up design enables them to slew easily over each other and therefore operate safely. This series already includes multiple cranes with high-tensile fibre rope. The series has now been expanded once again by the 520 EC-B 20 Fibre. The 520 EC-B 20 Fibre can perform heavy hoists of up to 2900 kilograms at the jib head at its maximum jib length of 83 metres. A maximum lifting capacity of up to 20 tonnes is possible.The 370 EC-B 16 Fibre is another new crane. Just like the 520 EC-B 20 Fibre, it features a fibre rope with a diameter of 25 millimetres. All the other fibre cranes in the EC-B series are fitted with 20 and 22 millimetre fibre rope versions. At a maximum jib length of 78 metres, the 370 EC-B 16 Fibre achieves a lifting capacity at the jib head of up to 2500 kilograms. Its maximum lifting capacity is 16 tonnes. The twelve tonne version of the 370 EC-B Fibre has already been launched successfully.. Benefits of the high-tensile fibre ropeThe high-tensile fibre rope, which is the result of 10 years of development work by Liebherr and rope manufacturer Teufelberger, is a pioneering technology. Fibre cranes achieve significantly better performance values than equivalent cranes with a steel rope. At the same time, a fibre rope is more durable, is easier to handle for reeving and maintenance work is more straightforward. The components of the cover wear at different rates – and the ropes must be removed from use at the latest when the red layer is reached. That means the crane operator can see at a glance when the fibre rope has to be replaced.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The Liebherr-Components world at Bauma 2022,News |06/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-liebherr-components-world-at-bauma-2022.html?page=35,"At Bauma 2022, Liebherr will offer the visitors a unique opportunity to gain an insight into the world of components alongside the latest developments in construction machinery, cranes, material handling and mining from 24 to 30 October 2022. In line with the Group's motto “On your site”, the Components product segment also demonstrates that the Liebherr team is always at the side of its customers, wherever they may be - whether directly on the construction site with innovative product technologies or through individual consulting, worldwide services and fully comprehensive solution concepts.Find out more",News,06/21/2022,"Liebherr's Components product segment will be showcasing its innovative product technologies at a booth measuring around 450 m² (hall A4, booth 326). It's all there - from digital solutions to alternative drive concepts for a functional future that trade fair visitors can already expect from Liebherr today.Vision through digitalizationDigitalization in making huge progress in all areas. In order to optimally master the associated challenges, Liebherr offers comprehensive digital solutions. The top priority thereby is to increase the performance, reliability and security of customer applications.Our camera-monitor systems and surround vision solutions in the LiXplore product family are based on digital camera technology. The assistance systems feature higher resolution and, therefore, a more detailed view of the working environment outside the cab. For drivers of a mobile machine this is of real benefit in terms of efficiency and work safety. Our overall IoT solutions also ensure greater data security.The integrated digital wear measurement system for optimum monitoring of slewing bearings, Bearing Clearance Monitoring (BCM), the force measurement sensor for hydraulic cylinders and digital condition monitoring for combustion engines also play a role in ensuring improved safety, higher performance and longer machine service life.Alternative drive concepts The optimum drive has a decisive influence on the efficiency of the work operation in question. The heterogeneous fields of application typical of construction machinery require the most suitable form of drive for the specific application and site, in order to ensure the greatest possible machine efficiency.With this in mind, Liebherr offers customers engines with high efficiency and very low NOx emissions with the same service life and maintenance intervals as diesel engines. The first hydrogen engine ever built at Liebherr, the H964, ensures high performance and efficiency at competitive costs and high availability thanks to the large proportion of common parts.In response to the trend of decarbonisation, Liebherr enhances the internal combustion engine and offers various hydrogen injection solutions. The system approaches for port fuel injection (PFI) and direct injection (LPDI) are based on a common, scalable injector platform. A wide range of applications is possible for medium and heavy-duty engines, as well as large engines in the 7 - 100 litre displacement range.To optimise the operating performance of hydrogen-powered commercial and construction vehicles, Liebherr is also developing electric turbochargers. Air compression provides a higher oxygen partial pressure and thus a higher power density. Our system approach with the integration of a compressor and power electronics enables weight and cost savings, as well as reliable technology that is easy to integrate into the vehicle.In the future, Liebherr's mobile energy storage systems will ensure locally emission-free operation of electrified or hybrid-powered construction sites. The challenge on fully electrified or hybrid-powered construction sites is operating machines at maximum power, charging all machines during break periods, or smoothing power peaks on sites with limited grid supply. We meet these challenges by developing energy storage systems with the highest power density, efficiency and quality.Innovative, efficient and open to technology into the futureWe take our product responsibility very seriously. Our goal is to provide customers with safe, efficient and environmentally compatible products in the long run. We wish to create solutions that meet both work and environmental requirements at all times.Available at any time and any place - this is one of the approaches we are pursuing with our new online configurator for hydraulic cylinders. In future, all products in the standard series can be conveniently configured via the Liebherr website and downloaded as 3D models, for example. All cylinder variants can be requested directly and easily via the configurator - Liebherr ensures a response within one working day.Hybrid cylinders as part of the fibre composite portfolio ensure greater effectiveness and efficiency of mobile and stationary applications. Thanks to the use of the lightweight components and the inherent weight savings, performance can be increased or fuel consumption reduced.Our axial piston hydraulics also offers flexibility in application. Thus, the LH30VO family with the nominal sizes of 28, 45 and 85 will be extended by the nominal size of 100. It is characterised in particular by a modular system of controllers and a high degree of flexibility for the drive-through concept. In addition, the rated size of 550 (also available as a double pump of 1,100 cm3) complements the selection of open circuit pumps. In the development of this rated size, the focus lied on robustness. This results in high availability and longevity in various applications.The newly developed combustion engine for off-road applications, the D976, is also suitable for individual customisation options. Its high power density, robust design and wide range of options make it perfect for the harshest environments and provide an ideal solution for a variety of industries and applications. Because the engine is compatible with hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), operators can reduce their emissions by up to 90% when filling up with the alternative fuel instead of diesel.Thanks to the Liebherr-Reman programme, customers benefit from cost-efficient procurement prices, fast and long-term spare parts availability and original manufacturer’s quality. The remanufacturing of used components into as-new parts also has an ecological impact: Up to 78% raw material can be saved and the CO2 footprint reduced by over 50%.Liebherr’s most powerful slewing drives, DAT 1000, are another exhibit highlight. These have been specially designed for heavy-duty applications in the highest quality with design and process expertise. With their immense power, they are nevertheless relatively compact in design and can be customised. They are indispensable, for example, when it comes to implementing the rotary movements for a heavy-duty crane that can lift several thousand tons..

Electrifying: Liebherr launches six new unplugged machines ,Press releases |06/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/electrifying-liebherr-launches-six-new-unplugged-machines.html?page=36,"Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH promptly reacted to the ever-changing requirements of the construction industry with the first battery-powered drilling rig in the world - the LB 16 unplugged. Today, no less than six new unplugged products can be presented from the fields of piling, drilling and lifting.Find out more",Press releases,06/21/2022,"Since the alternative drive of the LB 16 unplugged quickly established itself on the market as a Gamechanger, the design has been extended to further product areas. Today, the electrified unplugged series comprises crawler cranes as well as piling and drilling rigs.An outstanding feature of the battery-powered unplugged units is zero emission. They do not produce any exhaust fumes and are extremely quiet. This strikes the right note especially in noise-sensitive regions and finds favour with construction site personnel and residents. Whether London, Paris or Oslo - the concept has already been successfully applied in these metropoles.The battery is charged using a conventional jobsite electric supply. Operation can continue as normal while charging. In order to change to battery operation, you just need to pull out the plug, therefore: unplugged. Whether attached to the electric supply or not, the performance and range of application remains unchanged.All six models are available in both conventional and battery-operated versions and have identical performance specifications.. Piling: LRH 100.1 unplugged and LRH 200 unpluggedThe LRH 200 has been completely newly developed and closes the gap between the proven LRH 100 and LRH 600 in the series of piling rigs.A 200-kWh battery pack ensures that the unplugged models can operate in battery mode for 4 to 5 hours in average pile driving applications. Optionally, it can be upgraded to 400 kWh for 8 to 10 hours of operation.The new design of the LRH 200 extends the range of applications and makes if even more versatile in use. In addition to piling, the machine can be used for continuous flight auger, full displacement and down-the-hole drilling, as well as for soil mixing work. A torque of 250 kNm provides the necessary power.When equipped with the hydraulic hammer H 6 from Liebherr, the LRH 200 and the LRH 200 unplugged can lift piles up to 24.5 m long and weighing 16 tonnes. The machine especially excels with its large working range. A radius of up to 8.7 m has the advantage that the machine does not have to be constantly moved.The design of the leader enables inclinations of up to 18° in all directions. Furthermore, it is also possible to raise or lower the leader by 6.5 m (e.g., when working in a foundation pit), which makes the machine even more flexible.The Ground Pressure Visualization of the new LRH model calculates the current ground pressure in real time and compares it with the specified safety limits of the respective construction site. The ground pressure is displayed in the operator’s cabin. This means the operator is permanently aware of whether the machine is situated in, or is approaching, a critical area.The operation of the new piling rig LRH 200 is based on the proven concept of the LRH 100 and is therefore very user-friendly. The integrated data recording makes the analysis of the pile data extremely easy and saves a huge amount of time.. Drilling: LB 25 unplugged and LB 30 unpluggedOver many years, the drilling rigs LB 25 and LB 30 have proven themselves in the conventional version. The new battery-operated unplugged versions are identical with regard to application possibilities, weight or transport; however they have the additional advantage of zero emission. The drilling rigs can be used for all common applications in the field of deep foundation.Thanks to the optional extension of the drilling axis, the machines can be deployed for drilling diameters of up to 3.4 m. The optional rear support and the new design of the modular rear counterweight ensure higher stability and longer service life.In addition to the standard design, both machines are available in a Low Head version with a total height of 14.1 m, or as Ultra Low Head with only 7.7 m.For battery operation, the charging cable only needs to be unplugged and, for unlimited operation, reconnected to the construction site power supply. The battery is designed for a working time of 4 hours in Kelly operation. Whether in battery or plugged-in operation, the drilling performance remains unchanged.. Lifting: LR 1130.1 unplugged and LR 1160.1 unpluggedThe new machines LR 1130.1 unplugged and LR 1160.1 unplugged extend the range of crawler cranes from Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH.The electro-hydraulic drive of the new cranes has the same performance specifications as the conventional version. Both versions are operated in the same way, which is especially practical if the crane driver has to often change between machines in one fleet.The capacity of the battery is designed for an average lifting operation of eight hours. Alternatively, the main boom with luffing jib can be completely erected. The battery can be recharged within only 2.5 to 4.5 hours. As an option, the performance can be increased by 20 to 60 per cent using additional batteries.In idling mode, the sound pressure level of three unplugged cranes is equivalent to that of a normal conversation on the jobsite. This corresponds to a value of only 60 dB(A). If it is taken into account that a crawler crane is in idling mode for 60 % of the time on the jobsite, this low noise level is an advantage with great resonance.The designers of the crane laid great emphasis on the safety concept. As with all crawler cranes from Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH, the new battery-operated models are also available with all proven assistance systems.The latest system is the Gradient Travel Aid for the safe negotiation of slopes and inclines. The crane’s control system automatically calculates the centre of gravity and warns the operator before the crane leaves the safe area. While travelling, the operator receives information about the permissible and actual gradient, and the crane's overall centre of gravity at all times..

At Bauma 2022: Liebherr rail-road excavator with hydrostatic drive concept and début for articulated dump truck,News |06/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/at-bauma-2022-liebherr-rail-road-excavator-with-hydrostatic-drive-concept-and-debut-for-articulated-dump-truck.html?page=36,"At Bauma Liebherr presents a representative from the area of rail-road excavators with the A 922 Rail Litronic. The trade fair exhibit is equipped with a hydrostatic drive concept as well as the new, fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX®. Liebherr also provides a general outlook of solutions in terms of intelligent handling of attachments using the rail-road excavator. The articulated dump truck TA 230 Litronic also celebrates its début at Bauma – this is the first appearance of the machine on an international trade fair stage.Find out more",News,06/21/2022,"Munich (Germany), 21 June 2022 – Liebherr has been successfully developing and manufacturing rail-road excavators for track construction since 1967. At Bauma Liebherr presents the A 922 Rail for the first time with a hydrostatic drive concept. The new, fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX® is also shown at the machine. Following the successful, digital product launch at the end of 2020, the articulated dump truck from Liebherr celebrates its début on the international trade fair stage at Bauma in Munich. The powerful, robust and efficient machine was developed for tough off-road applications.. Liebherr rail-road excavator A 922 Rail Litronic with hydrostatic drive concept and new, fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX®At Bauma Liebherr presents the A 922 Rail Litronic for the first time with a hydrostatic drive concept and new LIKUFIX® quick coupling system. The exhibit at the trade fair has an operating weight of around 23,000 kg, meets the requirements of exhaust emissions standard Stage V and mainly impresses thanks to high performance and reliability. With the 120 kW / 163 hp engine and the perfectly matched hydraulic system, the machine reaches high work speeds with the usual fluid movements of the attachments.The innovative hydraulic concept consists of a Liebherr variable displacement double pump with a volume of 2x220 l/min and independent control circuits. High-performance, hydraulic attachments can thus be operated independently of the working and travel movements of the machine.Huge importance is attached to safety in track construction. As an OEM manufacturer, Liebherr offers comprehensive safety systems from one source, which are perfectly adapted to the machine requirements. These include technologies such as the load moment limitation, the height and turning radius limitation, as well as the virtual wall.The hydrostatic rail travel drive of the A 922 Rail is new: Two drive motors drive the rail-road excavator directly in the rail axis. This leads to lower tyre wear as there is no direct rail contact. In the trade fair configuration the machine is equipped with a standard gauge of 1435 mm. However, more track gauges will also be available in the future.Another highlight of the A 922 Rail is the new quick coupling system LIKUFIX® 33-9. With this quick coupling system attachments such as tamping units, mulchers with flaps or Liebherr stick extensions can be changed quickly, simply and safely from the operator's cab thanks to the integration of the second high-pressure circuit, as well as the overflow oil line and lubrication line. The new LIKUFIX® 33-9 is backwards compatible. This means that attachments which are equipped with the current quick coupling system LIKUFIX® 33 can also be changed.The A 922 Rail exhibit also gives visitors the opportunity to experience solutions in terms of intelligent handling of attachments. The new track-based attachment detection from Liebherr is presented live at the trade fair. In addition to displaying tool, application and location information, the solution also recognises the respective Liebherr attachment and automatically adapts it to the machine. The A 922 Rail at the trade fair is also equipped with a MIC 4.0 interface. This is a vendor-independent standard in communication and allows significantly simplified integration as well as control of various attachments in combination with Liebherr machines.. Début on international trade fair stage – TA 230 Litronic articulated dump truckThe TA 230 Litronic articulated dump truck is presented for the first time on an international trade fair stage. The machine was developed for tough off-road applications and is therefore perfect for transporting excavated materials and the mining industry. The machines are also used successfully for larger infrastructure projects and special applications such as tunnel construction. The powerful, robust and efficient Liebherr dump trucks deliver superb performance across all applications.The exhibit at the trade fair has an operating weight of 24,600 kg. The 6-cylinder construction machine engine with 12 l capacity and 265 kW / 360 hp in combination with the exhaust gas aftertreatment system positioned behind the operator's cab fulfils the requirements of exhaust emissions standard Stage V. The dump truck transports up to 28,000 kg of material in its large and robust trough. The trough volume can be increased with the tailgate. This also ensures that no material is lost during the journey. A big advantage of the TA 230 is shown in frequent changes of construction site: With wide tyres, tailgate and the side mirrors that can be folded in without the need for tools, the TA 230 has an overall width of under 3 metres and can therefore be transported quickly and without any costly special permit.The Liebherr dump truck is characterised by its innovative vision and lighting concept. The spacious operator's cab offers superb panoramic visibility of the driving, working and articulating area of the machine thanks to the excellent panoramic windows without any annoying struts and the short, inclined bonnet. The lighting concept with LED headlights also ensures a better view and thus also enhanced safety. LED dipped-beam headlamps with integrated high beam optimally illuminate the road and the extra powerful, optional LED headlights on the front of the cab illuminate the entire working area. The lighting at the rear of the trough and another light package at the mudguards light up the manoeuvring areas at night.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

New Liebherr wheel loaders at Bauma 2022,News |06/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-liebherr-wheel-loaders-at-bauma-2022.html?page=36,"Liebherr is showcasing compact loaders and mid-sized wheel loaders at Bauma 2022 – two wheel loader product lines which have undergone complete overhauls. At Bauma 2022, the compact loaders, also including the new L 504 Compact model, can be seen for the first time at a trade show in Germany. Liebherr is also using the world's leading trade fair for construction machinery as a stage for presenting the mid-sized wheel loaders to a cross-industry audience for the first time. Their stand-out feature is a significant increase in performance compared to previous models.Find out more",News,06/21/2022,"Munich (Germany), 21 June 2022 – The Liebherr compact loaders are represented at Bauma 2022 by the L 504 Compact and L 508 Compact models. The new L 504 Compact is the group' s smallest wheel loader. It embodies the qualities of the larger series while also representing an excellent value for the money. The L 546 model will represent the mid-sized wheel loaders at the Liebherr booth The trade fair exhibit is equipped with numerous intelligent assistance systems such as the redesigned and powerful Skyview camera system and the active personnel detection with brake assist. Other wheel loaders from other product lines, such as the L 509 Tele or the L 586 XPower®, complete the range of Liebherr wheel loaders on show at this year's Bauma.. Robust and powerful performers: the new mid-sized Liebherr wheel loadersLiebherr has redeveloped and completely redesigned its range of mid-sized wheel loaders. The newly-designed lift arms, featuring a z-bar linkage and improved working hydraulics, ensure maximum breakout, holding and return forces. Structural reinforcements on the lift arms and cross tube increase robustness. The modified z-bar linkage with electrohydraulic pilot controls has larger hydraulic cylinders and more powerful working pumps than before. The combination of these innovations enables faster cycle times and dynamic work movements – even with heavy attachments such as high dump buckets or log grapples.In addition to the new lift arms, the optimisation of the hydrostatic travel drive in particular contributes to the increased productivity of the wheel loaders. The more powerful engines are characterised by a higher maximum torque at a lower nominal speed. This results in power and efficiency increases with the same low fuel consumption. More powerful hydraulic components, such as larger travel motors and travel pumps, ensure greater traction in all three models and thus powerful bucket filling. To ensure the highest possible reliability, Liebherr has reinforced the axles in addition to the travel drive components: depending on the model, all three wheel loaders have larger front or rear axles than their predecessors.Intelligent assistance systems are also part of the overall package of the new mid-sized Liebherr wheel loaders. An example of this is the active personnel detection with brake assist. This optional assistance system, installed at the rear, warns the machine operator of dangers in the rear area both visually on the display and with acoustic signals. In order to provide a specific warning of imminent injury to people, the assistance system independently distinguishes between people and objects using smart sensors. As soon as the active personnel detection emits a warning signal, the brake assistant automatically reduces the speed of the wheel loader to a standstill in order to avoid a potential accident.. Safe and reliable helpers: the new Liebherr compact loadersLiebherr has overhauled its compact loaders. Now, almost 10 years on from their launch, the compact loader has become established as a safe and reliable helper in a wide range of sectors. The most important innovations include the operator's cab, which provides the operator with excellent visibility thanks to its enlarged glass surfaces. The optimised visibility of the lift arms also ensures an unobstructed view of the working attachment, and therefore maximum safety. Due to customer demand, the L 506 and L 508 models are now available as Speeder variants for the first time ever. In this version, they can reach a top speed of 30 km/h.The compact loaders have robust lift arms with a z-bar linkage, which facilitates the use of a wide variety of working tools. Liebherr has optimised the parallel guide for safe and precise operation when working with forks. For instance, this is important when transporting palettes with pavers or decking tiles in garden and landscaping applications. To increase versatility even more, Liebherr also offers the lift arms for the L 506 and L 508 models in the High Lift version on request. This is an extended version of the lift arms with a greater reach, which enables the compact loaders to also load larger transport vehicles.Liebherr compact loaders are confronted with a myriad of challenges when used in municipal services. Transporting materials with various buckets or forks, excavating with a 4 in 1 bucket, cleaning work with a sweeper, or winter services with a snow blade are just some examples of this. To ensure the mastery of this wide variety of applications, Liebherr also offers its fully automatic quick coupler system LIKUFIX for the three compact loaders. LIKUFIX allows the machine operator to change between mechanical and hydraulic working tools from the cab within seconds at the touch of a button. This saves time and reduces the risk of accidents as the operator doesn't have to leave the cab when changing the equipment.. Performance data for the two new wheel loader series from LiebherrAll specifications refer to the standard version. The wheel loaders meet the currently applicable emission standards.Model: Tipping load, Bucket capacity, Operating mass, Engine powerL 504 compact: 3,000 kg , 0.7 m³, 4,600 kg, 34 kW / 46 hpL 506 compact : 3,500 kg, 0.8 m³, 4,970 kg, 47.5 kW / 64 hpL 508 compact: 3,900 kg, 1.0 m³, 5,700 kg, 47.5 kW / 64 hpL 526: 8,730 kg, 2.2 m³, 13,170 kg, 116 kW / 158 hpL 538: 9,650 kg, 2.6 m³, 14,520 kg, 129 kW / 175 hpL 546: 11,010 kg, 3.0 m³, 15,410 kg, 138 kW / 188 hp.

Study confirms Technology neutrality reduces the most emissions,Press releases |06/10/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/study-confirms-technology-neutrality-reduces-the-most-emissions.html?page=37,"In order to achieve the international climate objectives, economies worldwide must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions significantly in all sectors. This also applies to the construction industry and its partners. This is why Liebherr, as one of the largest construction equipment manufacturers, is also working on new, efficient drive concepts. In doing so, the company focuses on technology neutrality which has been affirmed by a recent study.Find out more",Press releases,06/10/2022,"On behalf of the Liebherr Group, the consulting firm Frontier Economics conducted a life cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions of typical construction machines equipped with various drive technologies. The experts determined how much CO2 arises from production to operation through to the recycling of the machines.The aim of the analysis was to comprehensively calculate the emissions of the machines and their drives in order to be able to recognise and assess how greenhouses gas emissions can be most effectively reduced. In doing so it is important to look at the overall life cycle of the machines. This ranges from the mining and transport of the raw materials to production and the actual operation of the machine to the disposal and recycling: “Emissions analyses are generally limited to the operating phase. This is not enough for our products because greenhouse gas emissions also occur in the upstream and downstream phases of construction machines’ lifecycles,” states Stephen Albrecht, Member of the Board of Directors of Liebherr-International AG. “To get a complete picture, we examined all stages of the life cycle, including the production of energy and provision of the infrastructure.” These results are combined in a so-called product carbon footprint, which describes the emissions of a product throughout the entire life cycle.Dedicated solutions: E-drive for small wheel loaders or concrete mixers, hydrogen and HVO for mobile cranes The study examined three types of construction machines: mobile cranes, truck mixers and wheel loaders. As evidenced by the collected data, the three types require different drive technologies in order to reduce as much emissions as possible due to their different performance requirements: For truck mixers, electric drives make the biggest contribution to emissions reductions provided they use one hundred percent renewable electricity for charging. For mobile cranes, operation with hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) shows the biggest savings potential. Important is that the HVO is certified to be produced from plant and food waste, for example, and does not contain palm oil. Hydrogen made from CO2 neutral sources follows in second place. In the long term, operation with hydrogen seems optimal as the availability of HVO in the vast quantities required cannot yet be predicted. However, until the required hydrogen infrastructure and drive technologies are mature, HVO delivers the best results as an interim technology, particularly in existing fleets with combustion engines. Wheel loaders should be operated either with a battery electric drive charged with renewable electricity, or with e-fuels. “The results of the life cycle analysis show that there is no uniform solution for climate-neutral drives of construction machines,” adds Albrecht. Liebherr therefore relies on a technology neutral approach and can thus reduce emissions as much as possible depending on the machine and the application.A look at the Liebherr product portfolio, which includes 13 product segments and is particularly broad especially in the area of construction machines, illustrates what leads Liebherr to compare various drive technologies. The smallest machines have a power output of 30 kW, the largest have a power output of more than 3,000 kW. All these machines must perform reliably in completely different conditions in diverse applications. “A wheel loader on an urban construction site, for example, is exposed to different conditions than a mobile crane used in the construction of wind turbines,” explained Albrecht. “The former can often be powered by electricity. In contrast, infrastructure projects in rural areas often lack the necessary power supply for an electrical connection. In addition, more energy is often required than can be provided with a battery-operated electric drive."". Diversity wins: Liebherr thinks globally when it comes to reducing emissionsAgainst this background Liebherr demonstrates pioneering spirit and researches different technologies – always with a global and holistic perspective. The engineers work with the wide range of climate-neutral fuels and drive technologies: from certified hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) to e-fuels made from green electricity, water and CO2, battery electric drives and hydrogen drives, be it hydrogen combustion engines or hydrogen fuel cells. At the moment HVO is particularly interesting for the company because it is an already available, interim technology. It has the advantage that it can be used in older construction machines with diesel engines. These machines are often in use even longer in many regions of the world – and continue to cause emissions there. Emissions can also be reduced significantly with HVO as a diesel admixture – a further contribution to reducing climate change.Technology neutral approach, multipath strategyBased on the results of the life cycle analysis, Liebherr is in favour of adopting a technology neutral approach in the transformation of the construction industry. “Effective climate targets and incentives for the construction machinery sector must enable technological diversity so that the most environmentally friendly technology can be used depending on the performance requirements,” adds Albrecht. In this light, battery electric should not be viewed as a universal solution, but as one important technology in the future drive mix. Apart from electric drives, it is just as important to closely monitor the topic of hydrogen. The regulatory conditions for producing hydrogen and e-fuels, which are made from renewable sources, must also be established. After all, the interaction of all these technologies allows optimal solutions to be created for all application scenarios in the construction machinery sector.Electric excavators and cranes from Liebherr The intensive research and development work is already bearing fruit. For example, Liebherr’s programme already includes several construction and mining machines with zero-emission drive technology. One of around ten electric crawler excavator models is the crawler excavator R 976-E, which is supplied with electricity via cable. The excavator’s drive system produces hardly any noise during operation and zero local emissions. Or the all-electric truck mixers ETM 1005 and ETM 1205, whose batteries are charged between travel to and from the jobsite or overnight. A third example is the world’s first battery-operated crawler crane, the LR 1250.1 unplugged. The machine can be operated on site either with a conventional electrical connection or without a cable, hence “unplugged”, – with no reduction in performance compared to the diesel model. Liebherr also promotes the use of HVO in its factory in Ehingen, among other places. Since September 2021, all new mobile and crawler cranes produced there are filled with one hundred percent HVO before delivery to customers, and are also operated with HVO for on-site crane acceptance tests and test drives. The Liebherr factory in Kirchdorf a. d. Iller has followed suit: HVO is used for first filling and acceptance tests of earthmoving and material handling machines since January 2022. The factories’ internal logistics are also changing over to the climate-neutral fuel.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The new Liebherr mobile harbour crane,Press releases |06/08/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-new-liebherr-mobile-harbour-crane.html?page=37,"The Liebherr mobile harbour crane series gets ready for the future. The new LHM is more digital, more efficient and impresses with a modern exterior design. A new crane control system, advanced sensor integration and digital information transmission enable future assistance and partial automation systems. In addition, the Liebherr Pactronic hybrid system and the operator's cab have been improved to meet customer needs.Find out more",Press releases,06/08/2022,"With its new mobile harbour crane, Liebherr presents groundbreaking technical developments and updates that make the LHM product series fit for the future. The decisive innovation is the implementation of the ""Master V"" crane control system. Together with an even more efficient software architecture, this forms the basis for integrating future assistance and partial automation systems into the crane in the long term. Overall, the crane will become much more digital, networked, and smarter.The position of the outrigger system is now monitored by sensors and thus part of the internal data processing. The use of a new outrigger base in the field only requires a software update by Liebherr and thus offers more flexibility. Another practical advantage is the variable use of digital IP cameras for better monitoring of the crane interior as well as the external crane environment. The new crane control is supplied by an independent power circuit. This means that the crane can be continuously monitored by cameras and efficiently protected without the crane ignition being activated.. New hybrid system - Pactronic 2.0The Liebherr Pactronic 2.0 hybrid system represents the second generation of a hydraulic drive system using hybrid technology. An accumulator serves as an energy storage and provides support when needed by supplying additional, temporarily stored power. The second generation of the Pactronic offers the operator a choice of two operating modes, depending on the current work situation:Boost modeIn this mode, the Pactronic 2.0 acts as a significant power amplifier. Lifting speeds are significantly increased - without the aid of a larger or even additional engine for more power. This massively increases the efficiency of the crane. The LHM together with a Pactronic 2.0 hybrid system provides a reduced cargo-handling time and achieves the same performance parameters as a comparable device with two main units.Green modeThis mode is designed to save fuel or power consumption and to reduce CO2 emissions. During the lifting process, the Pactronic supports the main unit to such an extent that less power is required by the main drive, despite the lifting speeds remaining the same. As a result, absolute fuel or power consumption and emissions are reduced.The second-generation Pactronic is thus even more closely aligned to the actual needs of the user. By setting the individual lifting height, the power output of the Pactronic is adjusted accordingly. The additional energy of the Pactronic is distributed over the entire lifting process. It is also important to note that the new Pactronic reacts to changes in the outside temperature and the accompanying change in pressure in the reservoir, thus further increasing the efficiency of the system.. New maritime cabinThe redesign of the LHM operator's cab focuses on the crane operator. Thanks to the new coupling of control lever and armrest, not only does the driver's comfort increase, but the control of the crane also becomes even more precise and safe. With the new integrated touch panel, all crane functions can be selected clearly and intuitively, which greatly simplifies the operation of the crane. An integrated bottle cooler provides cool drinks - even on warm days. A revised air-conditioning concept significantly increases the well-being of the operator, whether air-conditioning or heating. It also ensures that fogged windows are quickly dehumidified, thus providing a clear view and more safety.. Innovation has never looked so goodThe colour compositions of the latest LHM generation combine the classic Liebherr yellow with new accents in black, grey, and white. The agile-looking design reflects how long-standing tradition and corporate values combine with advanced technologies. The modern colour scheme gives the machines a distinctive look and instant recognition. The blue accent in the colour composition and also the blueE-symbol next to the crane type, give all alternatively powered machines a distinctive look. This allows all future LHM customers to directly communicate advanced and environmentally friendly crane technology to their stakeholders..

Liebherr Generation 8 crawler excavators conquer Corsica,Press releases |06/08/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-generation-8-crawler-excavators-conquer-corsica.html?page=37,"Liebherr Generation 8 crawler excavators are successfully penetrating the French market. Corsica in particular, with its thriving market for crawler excavators and all other construction machinery, represents an important sales area.Find out more",Press releases,06/08/2022,"The R 934 crawler excavator for customer Graziani TP was the first Generation 8 excavator delivered to Corsica. Frederick Graziani, the company's managing director, is particularly satisfied with the stability during work and the performance combined with low fuel consumption of just 18 l/h.. In addition, he particularly appreciates the reliability and versatility of the excavator. This allows the company to take on larger jobs, such as demanding earthmoving work or large-scale rock crushing. This in turn enables solid growth for Graziani TP.Decisive purchase criteria for Frederick Graziani were also the origin of the excavator, which is produced in Europe, and the good reputation of the Liebherr brand. According to the managing director, Liebherr represents a very good price-performance ratio and efficient customer service.. Efficient and versatile useIn Balagne, at the other end of the island, there is also a satisfied customer who specialises in quarrying rock. Valérie Mercuri, managing director of the company Sablière de Calenzana from the town of the same name, particularly appreciates the versatility of the R 945 crawler excavator. On the one hand, dump trucks can be loaded very quickly, and on the other hand, the flexible changeover from bucket to a hydraulic rock breaker also allows drilling work for easier placement of explosives.The R 945 replaces an older Liebherr excavator at the customer's site that has already completed enough operating hours to be replaced. The new model is even more manoeuvrable, lighter than its predecessor and at the same time significantly more effective and efficient. Like all Generation 8 excavators, the R 945 is equipped with Liebherr's ""Positive Control"" hydraulic system, which forms the basis for smooth combined movements and an overall increase in performance.Valérie Mercuri particularly appreciates these technological advancements, which enable fuel consumption to be reduced by around 20 % to just 23 l/h, and this with even better performance data.. Generation 8 crawler excavators: Highest performance, maximum comfort and optimum serviceThe high load-bearing capacity and digging force round off the excavator's performance spectrum. Also noteworthy is the optimal comfort for the operator thanks to the noise reduction in the operator's cab and more safety thanks to the LED lighting and full all-round visibility.The operator has a spacious and comfortable workspace at their disposal in all working situations. The Generation 8 excavators offer a high level of operator comfort with reduced vibrations and a low noise level. To make daily work easier, the cab is equipped with an air-sprung seat with vertical and longitudinal shock absorption.Liebherr customer service is also a big plus for all customers and operators. The Liebherr branch in Marseilles, located in the suburb of Rognac, addresses all customers' concerns and ensures a fast and tailored service.In addition to technical requirements, design is also an important criterion.

100 percent Liebherr – Gräber extends fleet with new mobile cranes ,Press releases |06/07/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/100-percent-liebherr-graeber-extends-fleet-with-new-mobile-cranes.html?page=37,"Work platform, forklift and crane rental company Gräber took delivery of two new mobile cranes at the Liebherr plant in Ehingen at the beginning of May. Just a few weeks earlier, Liebherr delivered an LTC 1050-3.1 to the group based in southern Germany.Find out more",Press releases,06/07/2022,"“We founded our company in 1998 and started by renting out work platforms and forklift trucks. They are still our main source of business. Then, when we had established ourselves on the market, we started renting out mobile cranes in 2013 and since then we have been able to provide the complete package. We have relied on Liebherr cranes from the very beginning”, says company owner Alexander Gräber.. Currently, the Gräber Group, which has several outlets in southern Germany, particularly around Lake Constance, has seven mobile cranes, all of which were supplied by Liebherr. It is important to the company to keep its fleet right up to date. Thomas Gebhardt, Finance Director and member of the Board of Directors, continues: “This year we have already taken delivery of three new Liebherr cranes and we have placed orders for two more. Liebherr’s crane technology is innovative and the support the company provides after the crane purchase is outstanding.”The two latest cranes will supplement the fleet in sectors in which the company previously did not have perfect machines. “We bought the LTM 1070-4.2 at the request of our dispatcher because we did not have a taxi crane which could drive on public roads carrying ballast”, adds Gräber. With an axle load of 12 tonnes, the LTM 1070-4.2 can carry up to 10.7 tonnes of ballast and can therefore complete the majority of its jobs without requiring additional ballast transport vehicles. The maximum ballast on the Liebherr 70 tonne crane is 14.5 tonnes.. Authorised Signatory Jörg Rössler explains the decision to buy the LTM 1150-5.3: “We will mainly use the 150 tonne crane for assembling prefabricated concrete components. It delivers the performance for this job and we audited with a second hoist gear. That enables us to turn the components into the correct position with ease during the assembly process. The LTM 1150-5.3 fits perfectly in the gap between our 100 and 230 tonne crane, which is the largest model we have.”At a length of 66 metres, the LTM 1150-5.3 has one of the longest telescopic booms in its class. The Liebherr 150 tonne crane can complete a large number of jobs without requiring any additional ballast to be transported because it can be driven on public roads with nine tonnes of ballast..

Liebherr earthmoving and material handling machines at Svenska Maskinmässan 2022,Press releases |06/02/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-earthmoving-and-material-handling-machines-at-svenska-maskinmassan-2022.html?page=37,"The Svenska Maskinmässan, a trade fair for construction machines, takes place in Stockholm (Sweden) from 2 to 4 June 2022. There, Liebherr presents an extensive range of earthmoving and material handling machines on an area of 2,000 m².Find out more",Press releases,06/02/2022,"Liebherr is exhibiting numerous earthmoving and material handling machines for a wide range of applications at the Svenska Maskinmässan fair. With the L 508 Compact, the L 556 XPower®, the L 586 XPower® and the L 509 Tele, Liebherr is exhibiting four of its wheel loader models. Also on display are two representatives of the Liebherr compact wheeled excavators, the A 913 Compact and A 916 Compact, along with a number of Generation 8 crawler excavators. Furthermore, the TA 230 Litronic articulated dump truck is presented to the Swedish trade audience. Besides that, Liebherr is presenting two material handling machines for various operations in the field of recycling and waste management, the LH 18 M Industry Litronic and the LH 26 M Industry E. A telescopic handler and a dozer round off the range at the show.. Four wheel loaders at the Liebherr booth and trade fair premiere of model L 508 CompactAt Svenska Maskinmässan, Liebherr is presenting four wheel loaders with operating weights between 5,700 kg and 32,600 kg. The L 508 Compact, making its trade fair premiere, is the largest model in the new Liebherr compact loader series introduced this year. The most important innovations include the redesigned operator's cab, which provides the operator with excellent visibility thanks to its generous use of glass. The optimised visibility of the lift arms also ensures an unobstructed view of the working attachment and therefore maximum safety. For the first time ever, the L 506 and L 508 models are now available as speeder variants. In this version, they can reach a top speed of 30 km/h. In addition, Liebherr expands the compact loader series with the new L 504 model.. In addition, Liebherr is showing two models from its large wheel loader series, the L 556 XPower® and the L 586 XPower®. Liebherr fits a power-split driveline as standard for these wheel loaders. It combines hydrostatic drive, which is ideal for material uptake and travelling over short distances, with mechanical drive, the advantages of which come to the fore over long distances and when driving on gradients. The combination of these two drive types in a single wheel loader ensures maximum efficiency and outstanding fuel savings in every application. To further enhance performance, Liebherr has recently reinforced the lift arms and overhauled the working hydraulics of the L 556 XPower®. Innovations also include increased tip load, breakout force and engine power.For its mid-sized and large wheel loaders, Liebherr offers various intelligent assistance systems to increase safety and comfort. An example is the active personnel detection with brake assistant. This optional assistance system, which is installed at the rear of the wheel loader, warns the machine operator visually on the display and with acoustic signals of dangers in the rear area of the wheel loader. In order to provide a specific warning of imminent injury to persons, the assistance system independently distinguishes between humans and objects using smart sensors. As soon as the active personnel detection emits a warning signal, the brake assistant automatically reduces the speed of the wheel loader to a standstill in order to avoid a potential accident.Front area monitoring is another assistance system for wheel loaders. It is useful especially in industrial applications where wheel loaders often work with large attachments, high-dump buckets for example, for handling lighter goods such as wood chips, paper or waste. These large attachments inevitably obstruct the driver's field of vision. Hence, Liebherr offers a roof camera for front area monitoring to provide the operator with a view of the bucket in front of the machine from a significantly elevated perspective and transmits the image in the operator's cab. Front area monitoring is therefore used for seeing people or objects hidden by the attachment, which increases safety when accelerating, driving forward and loading with large buckets.. To complete the wheel loader line up, Liebherr is exhibiting the L 509 Tele telescopic wheel loader. This multifunctional machine combines the lift height and reach of a regular telescopic loader with the productive material handling capacity of a classic wheel loader. Instead of classic wheel loader lift arms, the L 509 Tele has an extendable telescopic lift arm which can lift to a height of 4.8 m with a fork attachment.. Two representatives of the Liebherr compact wheeled excavator rangeLiebherr compact wheeled excavators are the perfect helpers on construction sites where space is restricted, for example in inner cities, in road construction or in classic earthmoving work. At the Svenska Maskinmässan, Liebherr is presenting two representatives: the A 913 Compact Litronic and the A 916 Compact Litronic, which are shown live in action on the demonstration area.. The A 913 Compact has an operating weight between 13,900 and 16,000 kg and meets the requirements of emission level V. The 95 kW / 129 hp engine gives the machine excellent working and road performance with high fuel efficiency at the same time. With the A 913 Compact, Liebherr has developed a machine with both high lift capacity and enormous manoeuvrability and flexibility. The compact wheeled excavator is equipped with an extremely flexible undercarriage with all-wheel steering and crab mode. With the all-wheel steering, the steering movements of the front and rear axles act in opposite directions so that only a very small radius is needed when turning. In crab mode the steering movements of the front and rear axles act in the same direction. This allows the machine to be moved sideways without the uppercarriage turning.The A 916 Compact is one of the larger models in the Liebherr compact wheeled excavator range. Its operating weight is between 16,000 and 18,300 kg and it meets the requirements of emission level V. The machine concept of the A 916 Compact doesn't only impress with respect to performance; it also offers maximum flexibility. Its engine delivers a high output of 110 kW / 150 hp and thus fast acceleration, high terminal speeds and maximum handling volume. Fast and flowing working movements are possible thanks to the optimally tuned hydraulic system. The tight tail swing radius of just 1.80 m makes the machine ideal for extended operations, even in the confined space of construction site work.. Liebherr Generation 8 crawler excavators: highlights of the Svenska Maskinmässan trade fairAmong the products on display is also our tracked excavator R 920 Compact phase IV with its 110 kW / 150 hp engine. With its innovative maintenance concept, the Liebherr R 920 Compact combines the properties of a standard crawler excavator with the advantages of a compact machine, especially with its compact swing of only 1850 mm. This makes it the ideal tool for working efficiently on construction sites where space is limited.. Liebherr is also exhibiting its Generation 8 crawler excavators: the R 924 and R 926. With higher digging forces and greater undercarriage traction, these two new models combine performance and comfort with a heavier counterweight and minimal fuel consumption. For the launch of this new generation of excavators, Liebherr has completely revised the basic concept of its machines in order to offer its customers even more user-friendly and efficient products. In particular, access to the upper carriage has been extended and the maintenance platform now has handrails to increase safety during operation.. With a power output of 150 kW / 204 hp and an operating weight of 28 tonnes, our R 926 G8 model combines ease of operation and ergonomics without compromise. In order to offer improved performance, the architecture of the R 926 has been completely redesigned and updated. On demonstration at the exhibition, visitors have the opportunity to observe it in action. The R 924 G8 crawler excavator, developed and manufactured at Liebherr-France SAS in Colmar (France), is capable of handling work requiring regular tool changes, increased stability and high breaking forces. In short, our new R 924 excavator is an all-rounder.. Generation 8 dozers give customers new perspectivesThe diesel-hydraulic dozers of the new Generation 8 – a Liebherr PR 736 G8 is shown at the fair – feature powerful common rail engines from Liebherr's own production. Compliance with emissions level V is ensured across the fleet by the SCR filter, a combination element comprising diesel particulate filter and SCR catalytic converter. Electronically piloted, the response and the speed of the front and rear equipment can be flexibly adjusted to the operating conditions and requirements of the driver. The intelligent working hydraulics also feature assist functions such as blade emptying with vibration function, rear ripper park position and automatic blade lift when reversing, and they allow 2D and 3D machine controls to be integrated.The new assist systems of the Generation 8 dozers make several levels of driver support available: Free Grade for active blade stabilisation during fine levelling and Definition Grade for automatic blade positioning when creating 2D areas. Two independent, permanently integrated sensor circuits (gyro and inertia sensors) are used to stabilise all blade axes. In conjunction with the hydrostatic drive and optimised centre of gravity, this allows particularly high levelling speeds and extremely precise results. Furthermore, the option 3D Grade provides a factory-fitted GPS machine control from Topcon – fully integrated and calibrated at the factory. Alongside this, Ready Kits allow the simple retrofitting of the latest 2D and 3D control systems from Trimble and Leica.. Impressive in every dimension – telescopic handlers for heavy industrial operationsLiebherr is exhibiting the T 60-9s at the trade fair. Besides the freely regulated hydrostatic travel drive and high-performance working hydraulics, Liebherr telescopic handlers score with productivity-boosting assist systems such as Auto Power, Load Moment Plus and programmable bucket return, plus intelligent safety functions such as Auto Hill Assist and the intervening overload warning system. The particularly efficient hydrostatic travel drive allows an actual maximum speed of 40 km/h. Alternatively, the machines are available as 20 km/h and 30 km/h speed variants.The travel speed is freely regulated and with the optional Auto Power function, independent of the power currently required in the working hydraulics. The engine speed is automatically increased according to requirements (joystick deflection), regardless of the travel speed. The standard Hill Assist system, which automatically activates the parking brake, ensures maximum driving comfort and safety when driving over uneven ground. The installed high-performance working hydraulics are electronically piloted and the load-independent flow distribution allows powerful simultaneous work movements with sufficient power reserves.. Developed for the toughest off-road operations: the TA 230 Litronic articulated dump truckFollowing its successful digital product launch at the end of 2020, the articulated dump truck is presented to the Swedish trade audience at the Svenska Maskinmässan. With the TA 230, Liebherr has developed a dump truck in the 30-tonnes category for the toughest off-road operations. The robust and powerful all-terrain machine is primarily designed for transporting excavated materials and for the mining industry. The machines are also useful helpers in major infrastructure projects. Thanks to their optimal clearance profile, they can also be used for special applications such as tunnel construction.New designs in the front end area ensure maximum ground clearance and thus superb off-road performance. The powershift transmission is located under the cab and the exhaust gas treatment is positioned compactly and securely behind the operator's cab, allowing a large slope angle. The solid rotary articulated joint also provides for optimum off-road capability. It allows independent movements of the front and rear end to ensure maximum manoeuvrability. The robust and positive-locking swivel joint with tapered roller bearing is perfect for the shear loads arising during use, withstands maximum loads and provides optimal force distribution.A powerful 6-cylinder construction machinery engine with 12 l displacement and 265 kW / 360 hp is installed in the TA 230 Litronic, which complies with the requirements of exhaust emissions standard V. A robust and efficient drivetrain with automatic 8-speed powershift transmission ensures optimal force distribution. Automatic traction control is also available for the machine in the form of actively controlled longitudinal differential locks. As soon as slip occurs at an axle, the torque is cleverly transferred to the axle or axles with traction.The large and robust trough is designed for the effective transport of a payload weighing up to 28 tonnes. Numerous improvements have been made for quick and efficient loading and unloading, as well as safe transport of the material. The front of the trough is straight and the sills are low so that loading with a wheel loader, for example, is easily possible across the entire length. During the loading process, an innovative weighing system, which comes as standard, shows the current payload on the display in the operator's cab. An optional loading light on both sides at the back of the operator's cab shows the loading level outdoors.The newly developed, spacious operator's cab provides ideal conditions for comfortable and safe working. The excellent panoramic windows without any annoying struts and the short, inclined bonnet give the driver an optimum view of the driving, working and articulating area of the machine. In the soundproof cab, ergonomically arranged control elements facilitate intuitive operation of the machine. Various trays and storage spaces greatly expand the spatial offering. A new lighting concept with LED headlights also ensures improved visibility and safety – both for the machine operator and everyone in the outdoor area..

Liebherr earthmoving and material handling machines at Svenska Maskinmässan 2022,Press releases |06/02/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-earthmoving-and-material-handling-machines-at-svenska-maskinmassan-2022.html?page=37,"The Svenska Maskinmässan, a trade fair for construction machines, takes place in Stockholm (Sweden) from 2 to 4 June 2022. There, Liebherr presents an extensive range of earthmoving and material handling machines on an area of 2,000 m².Find out more",Press releases,06/02/2022,"Liebherr is exhibiting numerous earthmoving and material handling machines for a wide range of applications at the Svenska Maskinmässan fair. With the L 508 Compact, the L 556 XPower®, the L 586 XPower® and the L 509 Tele, Liebherr is exhibiting four of its wheel loader models. Also on display are two representatives of the Liebherr compact wheeled excavators, the A 913 Compact and A 916 Compact, along with a number of Generation 8 crawler excavators. Furthermore, the TA 230 Litronic articulated dump truck is presented to the Swedish trade audience. Besides that, Liebherr is presenting two material handling machines for various operations in the field of recycling and waste management, the LH 18 M Industry Litronic and the LH 26 M Industry E. A telescopic handler and a dozer round off the range at the show.. Four wheel loaders at the Liebherr booth and trade fair premiere of model L 508 CompactAt Svenska Maskinmässan, Liebherr is presenting four wheel loaders with operating weights between 5,700 kg and 32,600 kg. The L 508 Compact, making its trade fair premiere, is the largest model in the new Liebherr compact loader series introduced this year. The most important innovations include the redesigned operator's cab, which provides the operator with excellent visibility thanks to its generous use of glass. The optimised visibility of the lift arms also ensures an unobstructed view of the working attachment and therefore maximum safety. For the first time ever, the L 506 and L 508 models are now available as speeder variants. In this version, they can reach a top speed of 30 km/h. In addition, Liebherr expands the compact loader series with the new L 504 model.. In addition, Liebherr is showing two models from its large wheel loader series, the L 556 XPower® and the L 586 XPower®. Liebherr fits a power-split driveline as standard for these wheel loaders. It combines hydrostatic drive, which is ideal for material uptake and travelling over short distances, with mechanical drive, the advantages of which come to the fore over long distances and when driving on gradients. The combination of these two drive types in a single wheel loader ensures maximum efficiency and outstanding fuel savings in every application. To further enhance performance, Liebherr has recently reinforced the lift arms and overhauled the working hydraulics of the L 556 XPower®. Innovations also include increased tip load, breakout force and engine power.For its mid-sized and large wheel loaders, Liebherr offers various intelligent assistance systems to increase safety and comfort. An example is the active personnel detection with brake assistant. This optional assistance system, which is installed at the rear of the wheel loader, warns the machine operator visually on the display and with acoustic signals of dangers in the rear area of the wheel loader. In order to provide a specific warning of imminent injury to persons, the assistance system independently distinguishes between humans and objects using smart sensors. As soon as the active personnel detection emits a warning signal, the brake assistant automatically reduces the speed of the wheel loader to a standstill in order to avoid a potential accident.Front area monitoring is another assistance system for wheel loaders. It is useful especially in industrial applications where wheel loaders often work with large attachments, high-dump buckets for example, for handling lighter goods such as wood chips, paper or waste. These large attachments inevitably obstruct the driver's field of vision. Hence, Liebherr offers a roof camera for front area monitoring to provide the operator with a view of the bucket in front of the machine from a significantly elevated perspective and transmits the image in the operator's cab. Front area monitoring is therefore used for seeing people or objects hidden by the attachment, which increases safety when accelerating, driving forward and loading with large buckets.. To complete the wheel loader line up, Liebherr is exhibiting the L 509 Tele telescopic wheel loader. This multifunctional machine combines the lift height and reach of a regular telescopic loader with the productive material handling capacity of a classic wheel loader. Instead of classic wheel loader lift arms, the L 509 Tele has an extendable telescopic lift arm which can lift to a height of 4.8 m with a fork attachment.. Two representatives of the Liebherr compact wheeled excavator rangeLiebherr compact wheeled excavators are the perfect helpers on construction sites where space is restricted, for example in inner cities, in road construction or in classic earthmoving work. At the Svenska Maskinmässan, Liebherr is presenting two representatives: the A 913 Compact Litronic and the A 916 Compact Litronic, which are shown live in action on the demonstration area.. The A 913 Compact has an operating weight between 13,900 and 16,000 kg and meets the requirements of emission level V. The 95 kW / 129 hp engine gives the machine excellent working and road performance with high fuel efficiency at the same time. With the A 913 Compact, Liebherr has developed a machine with both high lift capacity and enormous manoeuvrability and flexibility. The compact wheeled excavator is equipped with an extremely flexible undercarriage with all-wheel steering and crab mode. With the all-wheel steering, the steering movements of the front and rear axles act in opposite directions so that only a very small radius is needed when turning. In crab mode the steering movements of the front and rear axles act in the same direction. This allows the machine to be moved sideways without the uppercarriage turning.The A 916 Compact is one of the larger models in the Liebherr compact wheeled excavator range. Its operating weight is between 16,000 and 18,300 kg and it meets the requirements of emission level V. The machine concept of the A 916 Compact doesn't only impress with respect to performance; it also offers maximum flexibility. Its engine delivers a high output of 110 kW / 150 hp and thus fast acceleration, high terminal speeds and maximum handling volume. Fast and flowing working movements are possible thanks to the optimally tuned hydraulic system. The tight tail swing radius of just 1.80 m makes the machine ideal for extended operations, even in the confined space of construction site work.. Liebherr Generation 8 crawler excavators: highlights of the Svenska Maskinmässan trade fairAmong the products on display is also our tracked excavator R 920 Compact phase IV with its 110 kW / 150 hp engine. With its innovative maintenance concept, the Liebherr R 920 Compact combines the properties of a standard crawler excavator with the advantages of a compact machine, especially with its compact swing of only 1850 mm. This makes it the ideal tool for working efficiently on construction sites where space is limited.. Liebherr is also exhibiting its Generation 8 crawler excavators: the R 924 and R 926. With higher digging forces and greater undercarriage traction, these two new models combine performance and comfort with a heavier counterweight and minimal fuel consumption. For the launch of this new generation of excavators, Liebherr has completely revised the basic concept of its machines in order to offer its customers even more user-friendly and efficient products. In particular, access to the upper carriage has been extended and the maintenance platform now has handrails to increase safety during operation.. With a power output of 150 kW / 204 hp and an operating weight of 28 tonnes, our R 926 G8 model combines ease of operation and ergonomics without compromise. In order to offer improved performance, the architecture of the R 926 has been completely redesigned and updated. On demonstration at the exhibition, visitors have the opportunity to observe it in action. The R 924 G8 crawler excavator, developed and manufactured at Liebherr-France SAS in Colmar (France), is capable of handling work requiring regular tool changes, increased stability and high breaking forces. In short, our new R 924 excavator is an all-rounder.. Generation 8 dozers give customers new perspectivesThe diesel-hydraulic dozers of the new Generation 8 – a Liebherr PR 736 G8 is shown at the fair – feature powerful common rail engines from Liebherr's own production. Compliance with emissions level V is ensured across the fleet by the SCR filter, a combination element comprising diesel particulate filter and SCR catalytic converter. Electronically piloted, the response and the speed of the front and rear equipment can be flexibly adjusted to the operating conditions and requirements of the driver. The intelligent working hydraulics also feature assist functions such as blade emptying with vibration function, rear ripper park position and automatic blade lift when reversing, and they allow 2D and 3D machine controls to be integrated.The new assist systems of the Generation 8 dozers make several levels of driver support available: Free Grade for active blade stabilisation during fine levelling and Definition Grade for automatic blade positioning when creating 2D areas. Two independent, permanently integrated sensor circuits (gyro and inertia sensors) are used to stabilise all blade axes. In conjunction with the hydrostatic drive and optimised centre of gravity, this allows particularly high levelling speeds and extremely precise results. Furthermore, the option 3D Grade provides a factory-fitted GPS machine control from Topcon – fully integrated and calibrated at the factory. Alongside this, Ready Kits allow the simple retrofitting of the latest 2D and 3D control systems from Trimble and Leica.. Impressive in every dimension – telescopic handlers for heavy industrial operationsLiebherr is exhibiting the T 60-9s at the trade fair. Besides the freely regulated hydrostatic travel drive and high-performance working hydraulics, Liebherr telescopic handlers score with productivity-boosting assist systems such as Auto Power, Load Moment Plus and programmable bucket return, plus intelligent safety functions such as Auto Hill Assist and the intervening overload warning system. The particularly efficient hydrostatic travel drive allows an actual maximum speed of 40 km/h. Alternatively, the machines are available as 20 km/h and 30 km/h speed variants.The travel speed is freely regulated and with the optional Auto Power function, independent of the power currently required in the working hydraulics. The engine speed is automatically increased according to requirements (joystick deflection), regardless of the travel speed. The standard Hill Assist system, which automatically activates the parking brake, ensures maximum driving comfort and safety when driving over uneven ground. The installed high-performance working hydraulics are electronically piloted and the load-independent flow distribution allows powerful simultaneous work movements with sufficient power reserves.. Developed for the toughest off-road operations: the TA 230 Litronic articulated dump truckFollowing its successful digital product launch at the end of 2020, the articulated dump truck is presented to the Swedish trade audience at the Svenska Maskinmässan. With the TA 230, Liebherr has developed a dump truck in the 30-tonnes category for the toughest off-road operations. The robust and powerful all-terrain machine is primarily designed for transporting excavated materials and for the mining industry. The machines are also useful helpers in major infrastructure projects. Thanks to their optimal clearance profile, they can also be used for special applications such as tunnel construction.New designs in the front end area ensure maximum ground clearance and thus superb off-road performance. The powershift transmission is located under the cab and the exhaust gas treatment is positioned compactly and securely behind the operator's cab, allowing a large slope angle. The solid rotary articulated joint also provides for optimum off-road capability. It allows independent movements of the front and rear end to ensure maximum manoeuvrability. The robust and positive-locking swivel joint with tapered roller bearing is perfect for the shear loads arising during use, withstands maximum loads and provides optimal force distribution.A powerful 6-cylinder construction machinery engine with 12 l displacement and 265 kW / 360 hp is installed in the TA 230 Litronic, which complies with the requirements of exhaust emissions standard V. A robust and efficient drivetrain with automatic 8-speed powershift transmission ensures optimal force distribution. Automatic traction control is also available for the machine in the form of actively controlled longitudinal differential locks. As soon as slip occurs at an axle, the torque is cleverly transferred to the axle or axles with traction.The large and robust trough is designed for the effective transport of a payload weighing up to 28 tonnes. Numerous improvements have been made for quick and efficient loading and unloading, as well as safe transport of the material. The front of the trough is straight and the sills are low so that loading with a wheel loader, for example, is easily possible across the entire length. During the loading process, an innovative weighing system, which comes as standard, shows the current payload on the display in the operator's cab. An optional loading light on both sides at the back of the operator's cab shows the loading level outdoors.The newly developed, spacious operator's cab provides ideal conditions for comfortable and safe working. The excellent panoramic windows without any annoying struts and the short, inclined bonnet give the driver an optimum view of the driving, working and articulating area of the machine. In the soundproof cab, ergonomically arranged control elements facilitate intuitive operation of the machine. Various trays and storage spaces greatly expand the spatial offering. A new lighting concept with LED headlights also ensures improved visibility and safety – both for the machine operator and everyone in the outdoor area..

Skyscraper construction in Singapore: World first for Liebherr luffing jib cranes,Press releases |06/01/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/skyscraper-construction-in-singapore-world-first-for-liebherr-luffing-jib-cranes.html?page=37,"Local regulations and the layout of the site presented considerable challenges for the developers of a skyscraper project in Singapore. The solution involves two new Liebherr 710 HC-L luffing jib cranes, which are able to climb inside the building with the help of a 24 HC 1000 tower system. This is the first time the climbing system has been used worldwide; it requires less effort, which reduces crane downtimes.Find out more",Press releases,06/01/2022,"Limited space, lifts weighing several tonnes and a world first: Two new Liebherr luffing jib cranes are currently raising a 48-storey office building in the centre of Singapore. Internal climbing systems have been a successful part of high-rise building construction for a number of years now. What makes the Singapore project a world first is that the two 710 HC-L cranes are using a 24 HC 1000 tower system to climb up on the inside.The cranes started work in November 2020. Back then, the cranes belonging to the fleet of the Kim Soon Lee company were assembled freestanding at a tower height of around 40 metres. The Central Boulevard Towers are being built right next to the historic “Lau Pa Sat” building, also known as “Telok Ayer Market”. One of the two new towers will be approx. 241 metres in height. It’s for this part of the project that the two 710 HC-Ls, with jib lengths of 40 and 45 metres, are being used.. Fewer climbing stages, less downtimeThe two cranes will reach their maximum tower height of 245 metres in just ten climbing stages. This is made possible by a 57 metre-high tower. “The number of times a crane has to climb impacts how long the downtime is for customers,” says Liebherr Tower Cranes project manager Eric Konijn, stressing the advantages of this solution. “We were able to offer our customer a solution with ten climbing stages, which saves them valuable time and consequently money.” One climbing stage takes about two hours, so the cranes stand still for as short a time as possible. In addition, there are significantly fewer storeys to reinforce, which also has a positive impact on cost efficiency.Due to the amount of guying that is legally required, and the resulting significantly increased costs, having the cranes climb completely on the outside of the building wasn’t a viable option. Plus, there isn’t enough space on site to use exterior climbing cranes.. Lifts of up to 30 tonnesThe high-performance Liebherr 710 HC-L model was chosen because of the tight conditions on site, and the project’s heavy load and handling capacity requirements. The 710 HC-L has a maximum lifting capacity of 64 tonnes and is the largest luffing jib crane Liebherr offers. It can easily lift and precisely position the pre-cast concrete parts, weighing up to 30 tonnes, which are needed for the skyscraper’s construction.When completed, the 48-storey tower will accommodate office and retail space. The Central Boulevard Towers project also includes a second tower, which is 16 storeys high. One of the highlights is an urban “sky park” with green spaces. Small recesses are to be incorporated into the greenery as meeting areas, and the park will also include a jogging track for employees to do their laps on.The two luffing jib cranes will be working on this site, which borders on high-traffic roads, for several more months. They will continue climbing skywards section by section, watched over by the city’s skyscrapers. When they reach their maximum height, they will tower over the surrounding high-rises..

Liebherr introducing ECM certification for rail-road excavators,Press releases |05/31/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-introducing-ecm-certification-for-rail-road-excavators.html?page=38,"Liebherr has been developing and producing rail-road excavators at its plant in Kirchdorf an der Iller since 1967 and is global market leader in this segment. Liebherr rail-road excavators can be used both on rail and on the road. Strict regulations have to be observed when operating in road traffic. In 2019, the EU Commission initiated a new directive intended to further enhance safety in railway traffic and to improve interoperability. The new EU ECM directive (Entity in Charge of Maintenance) now places responsibility on the holders of rail-road excavators.Find out more",Press releases,05/31/2022,"Kirchdorf an der Iller (Germany), 31 May 2022 – The new (EU) Directive 2019/779, also known as the ECM directive, is applicable for railway vehicles operating in the higher-level network. Liebherr rail-road excavators will also be subject by this new certification requirement in the future.. An ECM entity is to be assigned to every machine in the vehicle register so that this vehicle can be operated in the rail network. ECM, i.e. ""Entity in Charge of Maintenance"", denotes the entity responsible for the maintenance of the machine concerned. From June this year, Liebherr-Mietpartner GmbH and Carl Beutlhauser Baumaschinen GmbH are officially certified as such ECM points. The maintenance operations of Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH and Liebherr sales and service partners in Germany and Austria are certified. The Liebherr sales and service partner in the Czech Republic, Liebherr-Stavební stroje CZ s.r.o., was certified at the end of last year.. New implementation regulation demands certificationFollowing a serious railway accident in Italy in 2009 caused by a crack in a track wheel, directive (EU) 445/2011 was introduced to implement ECM as a system for the certification of ""entities in charge of maintenance of freight wagons "". Until now, this directive, which requires a comprehensive maintenance management system, has only been valid for goods trains. To enhance safety in railway traffic, the old directive has been revised and expanded.The new directive (EU) 2019/779, which came into effect in 2019, expands the application to all rail cars that operate on the public rail network. This also includes Liebherr rail-road excavators operating in various European countries such as Germany, Austria and in the Czech Republic. Non-EU countries such as Switzerland also base their requirements on this regulation.The revised directive also includes a mandatory certification system for all ECM entities in which the maintenance processes are audited. Vehicles that are not assigned to an ECM entity may no longer be used in railway traffic.Customer benefits thanks to ECM certificationLiebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH and the Liebherr sales, rental and service partners in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic have implemented a maintenance management system that is compliant with directive (EU) 2019/779. From June this year, these divisions will be officially ECM-certified.Successful ECM certification will enable Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH to continue giving customers competent consultation and support. Moreover, the company also upholds the customary high-quality processes in the production of rail-road excavators – and ensures ECM-compliant procedures.Successful certification also means that Liebherr sales and service partners will remain authorised and trained to perform repairs, annual inspections and revisions on Liebherr rail-road excavators. Liebherr-Mietpartner GmbH and Carl Beutlhauser Baumaschinen GmbH are also certified as official ECM entities. This will ensure that Liebherr rail-road excavators remain available to customers for rental in the familiar manner.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

During unloading the rail guide is lowered in axle pairs until the inner wheels of the dual tyres are at the track wheel and ensure a frictional connection of the travel drive.A 120 kW / 163 hp powerful and robust engine is installed in both machines. In combination with the optimally coordinated hydraulic system, the machines reach constantly high work speeds with the usual fluid working movements. For exhaust emission stage V Liebherr uses a newly developed SCRT system comprising a SCR catalytic converter and a standard particulate filter. The innovative hydraulic concept consists of a Liebherr variable displacement double pump with independent control circuits. High-performance, hydraulic attachments can thus be operated independently of the working and travel movements of the machines.The service-orientated layout of the machine guarantees short maintenance periods and minimises the associated costs thanks to the time savings. All maintenance points are easily accessed from the ground.The spacious two-person cabs featuring standard rollover protection (ROPS) and a modern interior design offer the best conditions for comfortable, focused and productive work. The usual generous use of glass and standard rear and side cameras provide an exceptional view of the working area and swing range.As occupational safety plays an important role in track construction, Liebherr offers safety systems specially developed in-house for rail applications. Numerous equipment features such as the pipe break protection on the lifting and stick cylinders, electronic height and turning radius limitation, load moment limitation i.a.w. EN 15746-2, impact-resistant roof panel made of laminated safety glass, rollover protection system (ROPS) and an emergency exit through the rear window provide maximum safety in all operations.. Rail machine attachments and quick coupling systemsIn order to meet the various construction site requirements efficiently and reliably, Liebherr offers a comprehensive portfolio of attachments to further enhance the versatility of its rail machines. With the fully hydraulic Liebherr quick coupling system LIKUFIX® both mechanical and hydraulic tools can be changed quickly and safely from the operator's cab. Both rail-road excavators presented at IAF are equipped with LIKUFIX®.One of the various attachments on show is the Liebherr tilt unit LiTiU which increases the productivity of the machines by giving an additional swing angle of up to 2 x 50°. This is a huge advantage especially in track construction where there are generally more restrictions due to the rail infrastructure. By extending the working envelope of the machines LiTiU enables them to access areas otherwise difficult to reach. At the trade fair LiTiU 33 is showcased as a sandwich attachment, i.e. the connection between the end of the stick and LiTiU, and the connection between the bottom of the LiTiU and the tool are made via LIKUFIX®. This means the entire unit can be set down quickly and a different tool, such as the Liebherr stick extension, attached and operational within seconds. The 2.25 metre Liebherr LS 12 stick extension on display can increase the reach to over 10 metres (depending on the stick length) to give an increased working radius.The Liebherr GMZ 22 clamshell buckets are also designed for track construction. They can be individually configured depending on customer requirements. The new generation with numerous new technical features is presented at IAF. Closely fitted and protected hydraulic lines ensure a reduced risk of damage. The new lean design of the ejectors with improved linkage for the grapples, combination and track construction buckets as well as the tilted side plates, lead to more efficient and less resistant grabbing as well as optimised loading and unloading operations. Top quality steel makes the clamshell buckets a robust and durable tool. Three different combinations are on show: The GMZ 22 with track construction buckets has a cutting width of 300 mm and capacity of up to 0.08 m³, whereas the GMZ 22 with combination buckets and grapples, each with a cutting width of 600 mm, have capacity of 0.20 m³ or 0.30 m³.Pivot rotators have also become indispensable in track construction work and the Liebherr TR 20 pivot rotator on show offers maximum flexibility specially when digging with its infinite 360° rotation, patented swivel mechanism and swing angle of 2 x 50°.. ECM certification for Liebherr rail-road excavatorsIn order to be able to operate in rail transport, compliance with strict rules and regulations is required in addition to the comprehensive machine safety systems. In 2019, the EU Commission initiated a new directive intended to further enhance safety in railway traffic and to improve interoperability. The new EU ECM directive (Entity in Charge of Maintenance) now places responsibility on the owners of rail-road excavators.The new DVO (EU) 2019/779, also called the ECM directive, applies to railway vehicles, which operate on the higher-level network. Liebherr rail-road excavators will also fall under this new certification requirement in the future. An ECM entity must be assigned to every machine in the vehicle register. ECM designates the authority responsible for the maintenance of the respective machine. From June this year, Liebherr-Mietpartner GmbH and Carl Beutlhauser Baumaschinen GmbH are officially certified as such ECM entities. The maintenance operations of Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH and Liebherr sales and service partners in Germany and Austria are certified. The Liebherr sales and service partner in the Czech Republic, Liebherr-Stavební stroje CZ s.r.o., was certified at the end of last year.Successful ECM certification will enable Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH to continue giving customers competent consultation and support. Successful certification also means that Liebherr sales and service partners will remain authorised and trained to perform repairs, annual inspections and revisions on Liebherr rail-road excavators. Liebherr-Mietpartner GmbH and Carl Beutlhauser Baumaschinen GmbH are also certified as official ECM entities. This will ensure that Liebherr rail-road excavators also remain available to customers for rental.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr at IFAT 2022 in Munich,Press releases |05/30/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-at-ifat-2022-in-munich.html?page=38,"Liebherr has a booth with approximately 280 m² of floor space at the IFAT 2022, the world's leading trade fair for water, sewage, waste and raw materials management, which is being held in Munich from 30 May to 3 June 2022. On booth 151/250 in Hall C5, Liebherr is exhibiting machines specially designed for operation in the waste management industry and in recycling. These include two representatives of the Liebherr wheel loader range, one of which – the L 538 – is celebrating its German trade fair premiere.Find out more",Press releases,05/30/2022,"The recycling industry is growing rapidly, and it is changing. In recent years, many waste disposal companies have developed from being generalists to being highly specialised recycling operations. This has brought about changes in requirements, and these have to be satisfied by the machines used in the recycling industry.Liebherr is meeting this challenge by developing machines and equipment options especially for the different operations in the field of recycling and waste management. Liebherr will be presenting a selection of these high-performance, economical and yet reliable machines to the trade audience at the IFAT in Munich.. New, medium-large wheel loader series from Liebherr with its German trade fair premiereWith the L 538, Liebherr will be presenting a representative of its new medium-large wheel loaders of the 8th generation for the first time at an exhibition in Germany. Liebherr has redeveloped and fundamentally revised this model series, which comprises three models. The machines are prepared for the tough requirements of the recycling industry. Their newly designed linkage provides for maximum breakout, holding and recoil forces. It features optimised Z kinematics and enhanced working hydraulics. The result is faster cycle times and dynamic and powerful working movements – even with heavy attachments like a high-dump bucket.Besides the new linkage, optimisations in the hydrostatic travel drive contribute in particular to the improved productivity of the wheel loaders. The new, more powerful engines are characterised by greater maximum torque at a lower rated speed. This allows both output and efficiency to be improved with unchanged low fuel consumption. High-performance hydraulic components, for example larger travel motors and pumps on all three wheel loaders of the medium-large model series provide for greater tractive force and thus powerful loading operations.Besides the travel drive components, Liebherr has also reinforced the axles for greater reliability. Depending on the model concerned, all three wheel loaders have larger front or rear axles than their predecessors. Moreover, Liebherr has reinforced the steel construction at the front end of the new wheel loaders to prepare the machines for handling heavy loads. Constructional reinforcements on the new linkage increase robustness, for example on the bucket arms or the transverse tube. A modern design that can be seen, for example, in the comfortable operator's cab and intelligent equipment are also part of the overall package of the new medium-large Liebherr wheel loaders.. Another wheel loader exhibit that Liebherr will be presenting in the outdoor area of the trade fair is the L 509 Tele telescopic wheel loader. This versatile special machine combines the lifting height and reach of a regular telescopic handler with the productive handling performance of a classic wheel loader. The L 509 Tele thus marries the advantages of two classes of machine in a single product. The Speeder variant of the Liebherr L 509 stereo wheel loader was used as the basis for development. That means, the telescopic wheel loader features the tried-and-tested stereo steering system and its powerful standard hydrostatic travel drive takes it to a top speed of 38 km/h. Instead of a classic wheel loader linkage, the L 509 Tele has an extending telescopic lifting arm that allows it to reach a lifting height of up to 4.8 m, for example with a loading fork.. The Liebherr LH 26 M Industry E electric material handlerLiebherr is presenting the LH 26 M Industry E at the IFAT as a representative of its electric material handling machines. The machine is predestined for operations in the field of recycling, for example material handling, unloading or sorting waste paper, waste wood and waste materials. Equipped with an extending, close-meshed protective grille and innovative recycling package, the machine scores with its high level of machine availability and reliability – even in extremely dusty conditions. The recycling package consists of a reversible, fold-out fan drive and an external air conditioning compressor.The innovative drive concept of the material handling machine includes a 90 kW Liebherr electric motor that guarantees powerful and dynamic working movements with low maintenance costs and low noise emissions. Furthermore, the drive concept includes an additional electric motor for auxiliary consumers, guaranteeing purposeful power distribution and maximum energy efficiency. Sophisticated frequency converter technology allows the engine speed to be individually adjusted to the respective use of the machine. Besides the simple adjustment to all common power supply networks worldwide, the frequency converter is also characterised by a substantial reduction in operation costs. This is achieved by preventing switch-on current peaks with a gentle ramp-up when starting and the related conservation of the hydraulic drive components.The machine at the IFAT is equipped with a 6.60 m long boom and a 4.50 m long stick with tilt geometry. The equipment also includes the Liebherr SG 25B sorter grab with a filling volume of 0.90 m³ and perforated tongs with a width of 1,200 mm. Another component of the machine configuration is the freely variable, height-adjustable hydraulic operator's cab. It can be variably adjustable for different loading situations, and it ensures an optimum view over the working area. A 785 mm wide platform with sliding door gives the machine operator comfortable access and entry to the operator's cab. The cable feed operates with a cable winding system that allows the machine to move safely within a working radius of 40 m, or more on request.. For efficient and economical goods handling: the new Liebherr GMM 50-5 multi-tine grappleLiebherr will also be presenting the new GMM 50-5 multi-tine grapple on the booth. The intelligently designed five-tine grapple was not only developed for customers, it was also developed together with customers. It is available for material handling machines with an operating weight of 35 to 55 tonnes. The new grapple combines decades of Liebherr expertise in the field of developing and manufacturing high-performance, robust attachments with a valuable wealth of experience from the users themselves. Only high-quality materials are used in the production of the new grapple. The components are produced from solid cast steel and from low-wear, high-strength steel plates. The multi-tine grapple impresses in particular with its exceptional robustness, resilience and durability, which make it predestined for operations in the field of recycling and scrap management.A comprehensive portfolio of buckets as well as a wide selection of optional equipment means that different materials can be handled efficiently and economically in recycling and scrap handling. The GMM 50-5 is designed specially for grabbing mixed and shredded waste as well as chippings or shavings with bulk of up to 1.10 m³. The arrangement and shape of the tines are optimised for perfect penetration and for holding bulky and at the same time loose material. There is a choice of three tine sizes for handling diverse materials: The version with open tines is perfect for handling large-size and bulky scrap objects. The version with semi-closed tines is ideal for medium-sized, mixed materials and shredding waste. Small, fine materials and chippings or shavings can be handled most effectively with the closed, heart-shaped tines.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Smart equipment solutions: Liebherr presents new multi-tine grab ,Press releases |05/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/smart-equipment-solutions-liebherr-presents-new-multi-tine-grab.html?page=38,"Liebherr presents its newly developed multi-tine grab GMM 50-5. The intelligently designed five-tine grab was not only developed for customers, but also developed together with them.Find out more",Press releases,05/24/2022,"Recycling and scrap handling are some of the toughest applications in industrial goods handling. Robustness, reliability and efficiency are required therefore, choosing the right attachment for the job is key for efficient and economical goods handling.With the five-tine grab GMM 50-5 Liebherr has developed a new attachment that fully meets these special operational requirements. A comprehensive portfolio of buckets as well as a wide selection of optional equipment means that diverse materials can be handled efficiently and economically in recycling and scrap handling. Only top-quality materials are used for the manufacture of the new grab. The GMM 50-5 is available for material handlers with an operating weight from 35 to 55 tonnes.. Extremely robust and resistantThe components of the new GMM 50-5 are made of sturdy cast steel as well as low-wear, high-strength steel sheets. The consistent use of the high-quality materials guarantees extreme stability and resistance for the toughest applications and material handling scenarios. The special shape of the tine support and the buckets was developed based on state-of-the-art calculation and simulation software. Thanks to this modern development process, the new grab is extremely robust and resistant despite its low dead weight.. Focus on maximum service life and performance In the design phase special attention was paid to maximum service life: In order to split the high torque, the slewing drive, for example, was equipped as standard with two motors. This increases the service life and minimises wear considerably. Both rotary transmission and the reinforced slewing drive are sealed multiple times to give maximum protected against external factors such as dust and water.Large and flow-optimised oil ducts not only ensure fast work speeds, but also efficient machine operation. The sealed, anti-twist piston rod protection for hydraulic cylinders is also included with the grab as standard. The latter come with new cylinder kinematics, which also guarantee a long-lasting and good closing mechanism also when the tines becomes worn.A newly designed wear back on the tines also extends the service life immensely. Long-lasting good and precise penetration in diverse scrap and recycling materials is due to the special shape and alignment of the tine tips. They are made from a new type of material for a long service life.. Easy servicing and numerous optionsAs the lubrication points are arranged ergonomically and logically, the GMM 50-5 is supplied with the necessary lubrication in a very short space of time. Perfect tolerances and generously dimensioned bearing surfaces lead to gentle interplay of the individual components.Thanks to the optional motor and hose protection damage to rotary motors and hydraulic lines is minimised. An optional central lubrication system assumes regular, automatic lubrication of all central points. The GMM 50-5 can be equipped with shackles to protect magnetic plates. In order to protect the edges of the often highly stressed internal sheet of the grab against wear and tear, the tines can be equipped with a reinforcement set of wear-resistant sheets..

STRABAG relies on LIKUFIX® from Liebherr ,News |05/16/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/strabag-relies-on-likufix-from-liebherr.html?page=38,"One of Europe's largest construction service providers, STRABAG  SE from Austria, has been successfully using the fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX® from Liebherr for several years now in addition to several Liebherr construction machines and attachments.Find out more",News,05/16/2022,"Apart from its comprehensive portfolio of earthmoving machines and material handlers, Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH also provides numerous attachments appropriate for the respective application, as well as different configuration levels of quick coupling systems.STRABAG SE is an international European group, whose comprehensive range of services includes structural and civil engineering as well as road construction. In addition to deep foundation machines and tower cranes, the company also uses various machines from the earthmoving division. Due to the complex and versatile range of services at STRABAG, a frequent change of attachment is generally unavoidable especially with hydraulic excavators. Machine operators regularly change the attachment in day-to-day site work. Therefore, for productive, efficient and safe construction site operation the fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX® from Liebherr has been used successfully for several years at STRABAG.. LIKUFIX®: Integral component of future machine equipment The use of a hydraulic excavator together with a quick coupling system is a basic prerequisite for economical, efficient and competitive use, says Rudolf Arnold, Managing Director Sales at Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH. Liebherr offers three different configuration levels of quick coupling systems: Apart from mechanical quick coupling systems for infrequent changes of attachments, the hydraulic quick coupling system is perfect for frequent changes. The quick coupler can be operated at the touch of a button; however, the hydraulic lines must be manually connected and separated. With the fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX® the attachment change can be conveniently realised from the operator's cab. Thanks to the combination of hydraulic quick coupler and LIKUFIX® coupling block, both mechanical and hydraulic attachments are quickly combined with the machine to create a powerful and high-performance unit.According to Martin Philipp, Head of Investment and Procurement at STRABAG BMTI GmbH & Co. KG, the majority of the wheeled and crawler excavators in new investments are equipped with the fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX®. This concerns both Liebherr machines and machines from other manufacturers as the quick coupling systems from Liebherr can be used with machines from all manufacturers. For STRABAG it is a worthwhile additional investment as the efficiency of hydraulic excavators is boosted significantly thanks to the quick change of attachment.. Positive experiences with LIKUFIX® LIKUFIX® has already been used successfully at STRABAG since 2007. The fully hydraulic quick coupling system from Liebherr mainly impresses in terms of high product quality as well as easy servicing and maintenance. Liebherr continuously optimises these aspects in the course of further product development. For instance, with the new HD generation of quick coupling systems the steel structure was optimised compared to the predecessor series, whereby the life could once again be significantly increased. The new generation was also designed in view of optimised maintenance so that maintenance work can now be carried out even more simply, for shorter downtimes sometimes even directly on the construction site.LIKUFIX® not only increases the efficiency, but also safety in day-to-day construction site operation. An important factor for the company because huge importance is attached to safety in the STRABAG Group. The attachment is changed from the operator's cab at the touch of a button. This ensures that nobody is in the danger zone during the change of attachment. A unique advantage of the quick coupling system from Liebherr is exhibited here: Instead of the pressure control of the locking cylinder, each hydraulic Liebherr quick coupler has electronic position sensors as standard which monitor the position of the locking bolt. An optical and acoustic warning informs the machine operator when the quick coupler is opened. In addition, the machine operator can confirm whether the quick coupler is safely connected to the attachment thanks to good visibility of the left locking bolt. Another proximity sensor monitors the correct position of the attachment in the locking position, thus ensuring enhanced safety in further construction site operation.. LIKUFIX® is fully hydraulicThe fully hydraulic quick coupling system LIKUFIX® is a hydraulic quick coupler combined with the hydraulic block LIKUFIX®, which was developed by Liebherr in 2000, highlights Frederik Kössinger, Sales Manager of Attachments and Quick coupling Systems at Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH. LIKUFIX ® has hydro-mechanical bearings, meaning the system can be perfectly balanced on all axles and at all degrees of freedom, he adds. Furthermore, the quick coupling system is easy to clean and dirt can be easily detected. A solid metal plate and sunken hydraulic couplings prevent damage during the coupling process. An optional bracket at the coupling block also protects the hydraulic lines against damage. Depending on the tonnage class, Liebherr has four different LIKUFIX® variants in the portfolio in the area of hydraulic excavators. Liebherr also has two fully hydraulic quick coupling systems for material handlers..

A first for Serbia – Beokran takes delivery of Liebherr LTM 1150-5.3 mobile crane,News |05/09/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/a-first-for-serbia-beokran-takes-delivery-of-liebherr-ltm-1150-5-3-mobile-crane.html?page=39,Crane and special haulage contractor Beokran d.o.o. has taken delivery of the firs Liebherr LTM 1150-5.3 mobile crane in Serbia. The new 150 tonne crane will supplement the Belgrade-based company’s crane fleet between machines with lifting capacities of 130 and 200 tonnes. The 66 metre telescopic boom was an important criterion behind the decisionFind out more,News,05/09/2022,"“The new LTM 1150-5.3 fits into our crane fleet perfectly between our LTM 1200-5.1 and the LTM 1130-5.1. The 150 tonne machine is now the second most powerful crane in our fleet”, says Goran Karanovic, founder and owner of the company based in the Serbian capital. “The 66 metre telescopic boom is perfect for erecting tower cranes. That was a very important criterion for us when we decided to buy the new crane.”Long, powerful telescopic boomThe telescopic boom on the new LTM 1150-5.3 is six metres longer than the one on its predecessor, the LTM 1130-5.1. At the same length of 60 metres, the new 5-axle crane can hoist 12 tonnes when fully raised – 1.5 tonnes more than its predecessor. When fully extended to 66 metres, the new crane has a lifting capacity of over 9 tonnes. That makes it perfect for erecting tower cranes and radio masts. Lattice extensions enable the Liebherr 150 tonne crane to achieve hook heights of up to 92 metres and radii of up to 72 metres. A 7 metre lattice section is used as a boom extension for this purpose along with a 10.8 to 19 metre double folding jib. The latter can be adjusted hydraulically between 0° and 40°.The LTM 1150-5.3 is immediately ready for use when it reaches the site. This is because it carries nine tonnes of ballast whilst travelling at a gross weight of 60 tonnes and with an axle load of 12 tonnes. That means it can complete lots of jobs without requiring additional ballast transport vehicles. That saves time and money.Beokran has always chosen LiebherrGoran Karanovic founded Beokran in 2007 with two small mobile cranes with lifting capacities of 8 and 20 tonnes. He continues: “As my budget was not enough for a new crane, I bought a used Liebherr LTM 1040/1. We renovated it, were successful and after a year we bought another LTM 1040/1 and an LTM 1060/2.” Today, Beokran employs 25 people and has eleven Liebherr mobile cranes with lifting capacities ranging from 40 to 200 tonnes as well as several special transport vehicles and loading cranes.“Liebherr provides excellent service along with its Serbian partner, DS Inženjering. The high level of quality and service has minimised the downtimes of our cranes. Beokran builds on the Liebherr brand”, adds Karanovic..

Two Liebherr R 9200 for NMDC iron mines in India ,News |05/03/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/two-liebherr-r-9200-for-nmdc-iron-mines-in-india.html?page=39,"At one of India’s most prosperous iron mines, the Donimalai iron mines, two new Liebherr mining excavators R 9200 have joined the fleet with the goal of boosting future production.Find out more",News,05/03/2022,"After a shutdown period of more than two years, iron ore extraction started again in 2021 in the Donimalai iron mines in the Indian state of Karnataka in the south of the country. Now, its fleet has grown by a reliable pair: two Liebherr R 9200 face shovel excavators for mining applications. The R 9200 comes with a 12.5 m³ bucket in standard configuration, the class-leading bucket capacity in the 200t class. Both machines received 9 m³ extra heavy-duty design buckets for the highly demanding application of the Donimalai site. Liebherr R 9200 excavators provide maximum uptime not only because of their high reliability, but also because of their easy serviceability and offer peak fuel burn efficiency.A significant contribution to India’s iron ore productionNMDC is India’s single largest producer of iron ore with a production of 35 million tonnes per year. Currently, the Donimalai iron mines yield around 20% of NMDC’s total yearly production, approximately 7 MTPA. In future, the company wants to boost its iron ore production to as many as 100 MTPA. Together, the two mines located at the Donimalai site comprise a concession area of 597.54 hectares (1476,55 acres). With an allowed mining rate of 0.5 – 0.6 million tonnes per month and an estimated iron resource of around 149 million tonnes, estimates say that the mine will still be exploitable for around 20 – 25 years."
In a double pack: Clausen Kran AG procures Liebherr mobile cranes,Press releases |05/03/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/in-a-double-pack-clausen-kran-ag-procures-liebherr-mobile-cranes.html?page=39,The Valais-based company Clausen Kran AG rounds off its crane fleet with a Liebherr LTM 1150-5.3 mobile crane and an LRT 1090-2.1 rough terrain crane. The Brig-based company is an expert in crane operations in the mountains and relies 100 percent on Liebherr mobile and crawler cranes.Find out more,Press releases,05/03/2022,"Company owner Geri Clausen explains: “The LTM 1150-5.3 is a powerful all-rounder allowing flexible use thanks to its variable driving conditions. Its five axles make it very compact and manoeuvrable. With the detachable boom, it also offers a great advantage for a variety of operations in our mountainous region.” Cornelia Clausen-Ogi, company owner, adds: “The LRT 1090-2.1 rough terrain crane is an ideal addition to our crane fleet, enabling us to offer our customers customised solutions for their projects.”. Flexible all-rounder with 66 metre telescopic boomClausen is planning the new LTM 1150-5.3 for assembly and disassembly of construction cranes as well as for operations in chemical plants where large lifting heights are required. For power stations and cable car projects with weight-limited access, the Liebherr 150-tonne crane is ideal as it weighs 31 tonnes with the boom dismantled. All mobile and crawler cranes in the Clausen Kran AG fleet are made by Liebherr. “We enjoy a long-standing and trusting partnership with Liebherr. I have a high regard for Liebherr's modern crane technology, as I myself use the vehicles nearly every day”, declares Geri Clausen.Clausen also cites Liebherr’s famously good service as an important decision criterion: “Standing for quality and service, Liebherr has been providing us with state-of-the-art crane and drive technology for years. We receive excellent support and Liebherr-Baumaschinen AG in Reiden is there for us around the clock”.The LTM 1150-5.3 has a 66-metre telescopic boom, putting it on a par with crane types in the 200-tonne capacity class. It scores with outstanding lifting capacities in a steep position as well as with a large radius. And it is ready for immediate use on the construction site: With a total weight of 60 tonnes and an axle load of 12 tonnes, the new 150-tonne truck already carries nine tonnes of ballast. This means it can do many jobs without the need for extra ballast transport. That saves time and money. It also has an optional detachable boom and removable sliding beams. When both components are removed, the LTM 1150-5.3 weighs around 31 tonnes. This makes it much easier to obtain special permits for the routes to be travelled.. “Safety first”The Liebherr LRT 1090-2.1 rough terrain crane – sold for the first time in Switzerland – was designed above all with a high degree of safety in mind. Standard equipment includes sliding beam monitoring. This automatically detects the support status – on tyres or supports – and transfers it to the crane control. The LRT also comes with the variable supporting base VarioBase® as standard. This boosts flexibility on the construction site, while at the same time increasing the crane’s lifting capacity. With a maximum lifting capacity of 90 tonnes and a maximum lifting height of 66 metres, the 2-axle crane is ideally suited for off-road use.Clausen Kran AG was founded in 1972. The fleet is distinguished by its diversity and currently consists of seven mobile and crawler cranes with lifting capacities of up to 250 tonnes as well as three heavy-duty tractors. Thanks to innovative ideas, the company is one of the leading providers of crane work and special transports in the Valais and Switzerland..

HLC 295000 ready to work,Press releases |05/02/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/hlc-295000-ready-to-work.html?page=39,"The HLC (Heavy Lift Crane) 295000 is on board the “Orion”, the next generation offshore installation vessel by DEME. Being the largest crane Liebherr has ever built, it has a maximum lifting capacity of 5,000 Tonnes. Its working field will be the offshore industry, in which it will help installing wind farms and decommissioning “old” energy platforms.Find out more",Press releases,05/02/2022,"After the vessel had left the port of Rostock on 27 March, the ship had its name-giving ceremony in Vlissingen in the Netherlands at the end of last week. It was Mrs.Amélie Michel, spouse of Mr. Charles Michel, President of the European Council, who did “the honours”. Among the several hundred spectators in attendance, DEME CEO Luc Vandenbulcke as well as DEME chairman Luc Bertrand were present. Patricia Rüf, Member of the administrative board of Liebherr-International AG and joint management of the maritime cranes company area of the Liebherr Group as well as Leopold Berthold, Managing Director of Liebherr-MCCtec Rostock GmbH came from Liebherr’s side.In discussions and gestures, the event was widely regarded as a symbol of partnership and ongoing cooperation between the two companies. In the next weeks, the vessel will be headed towards Rügen. Roughly 20 kilometres northeast from the island, the offshore wind farm “Arcadis Ost I” in the Baltic Sea will be constructed.“What we are witnessing here, is indeed a very memorable event. Fundamentally, it demonstrates what is achieved, when people are closely working together, especially alongside with a competent and reliable partner. Today, we are proud. In an extraordinary effort, our team at Liebherr brought this heavy lift crane up on this ship so now everyone can see what has been accomplished,” so Robert Pitschmann, Global Application Manager Heavy Lift Offshore at Liebherr.Basically, by the help of the compact design, the crane is destined to serve in the offshore market. For example the base column, being only 16.8 metres diameter, is unique in the market. The HLC 295000 requires little space on deck and offers more storage space for transportation. It is ready to take up its work in the ample field of the offshore industry. With its maximum capacity of 5,000 tons and an outreach of up to 151 metres, the HLC can manage large components, for example, during the decommissioning of offshore platforms.. The well-paved road towards the new job After the vessel left Rostock, it was at sea and took a series of offshore testing, incl. several overload tests. Additional works took place for adjustments and final inspections. All tests were executed and passed successfully. Hence, the vessel could be handed to DEME in Bremerhaven soon after. DEME, a Belgian company acting globally, which is active in the various fields of the marine engineering, including solutions for the offshore energy market. For Liebherr, DEME is a strong affiliate and both have been working together cooperatively during recent years. Eventually, it departed to Vlissingen in April, where today’s naming ceremony was held. Its final departure to “Arcadis Ost I” will be in the next weeks.“‘Orion’ heralds a new era in the offshore energy industry – one which will be dominated by multi-megawatt turbines, jackets and components. The combination of load capacity and superior lifting heights of ‘Orion’ will enable DEME to play an important role in helping the industry successfully navigate the energy transition,” so Luc Vandenbulcke, CEO DEME Group.. Shaping tomorrow’s energy This heavy lift crane will gain a decisive impact in the energy transformation since it will support the construction of windfarms, on the one hand. On the other hand, it will be used for the decommissioning of “old” platforms, a development pushed forward by offshore wind. Essentially, this conveys a reduction in offshore oil and gas installations. It will carry with it, hence, a focus of dismantling parts as large as possible in order to reduce resources on transport. Conclusively, the Liebherr crane could enhance working on the energy revolution because it is able to function on “both ends” of the contest for greener energy. Indeed, both fields of application can now be served by a single Liebherr product: the heavy lift crane.Moreover, a maximum lifting height of 175 metres enables the HLC 295000 to operate in the required height right away without special efforts. All this demonstrates that the heavy lift crane in general can be regarded as the ideal instrument for the challenges ahead within the changing field of energy production as well as in all related working areas closely related to it. The extraordinary efficiency, swift- and readiness when it comes to transporting, accuracy but also power give this Liebherr heavy lift crane and the HLC-Series an advancement due to its smart versatility..

It will strengthen the crane fleet at the crane and heavy haulage contractor based in Taranto.Find out more,Press releases,04/28/2022,"Andrea Caroppi, Technical and Commercial Director and Member of the Board of Directors at Magis S.r.l. comments: “The reasons for the investment in such an important vehicle are very wide-ranging and varied. The new crane expands the capacity of our portfolio. As for all the other new machines in our fleet, the decision was made to purchase from Liebherr because the company stands for technical reliability, performance, innovation and an eye for detail.” Before buying the LTM 1750-9.1, Magis looked very closely at the alternatives to the machine. Over the last four years the crane and heavy haulage contractor has been renewing its fleet in stages. The important feature in this process was that the new machines must include the latest developments in safety and sustainability and also be able to meet current reliability and competitiveness standards. “At the end of all our deliberations, we decided on a Liebherr telescopic mobile crane, which delivers a high level of mobility as well as short set-up times whilst also being powerful in its various configurations”, adds Andrea Caroppi. Another criterion in deciding on the LTM 1750-9.1 was its great flexibility for operating in all sectors.Wide range of uses with powerful boom systemsThe 9-axle LTM 1750-9.1 can carry its complete telescopic boom when driving on public roads. Due to its high lifting capacities and variable boom system, it can cover a wide range of jobs in industry, infrastructure and the energy sector. Its Y-telescopic boom guying enables the crane to achieve enormous lifting capacities. The all-terrain crane is designed to ensure particularly short set-up times and great mobility. The extensive comfort and safety equipment, such as load charts for various wind speeds, round off the concept for the LTM 1750-9.1. An 800 tonne upgrade has been available since 2020, making this mobile crane significantly more powerful.Most powerful crane in the Magis fleet The LTM 1750-9.1 is now the flagship in the Magis fleet. It is now the most powerful crane operated by the company and will replace an LTM 1500-8.1. The planned range of uses for the new LTM 1750-9.1 at Magis is extremely varied. The potential areas of work include both the new construction and demolition of plant and structures in the industrial sector, for example steelworks, chemical and petrochemical plants and prefabricated components, as well as the erection and maintenance of wind farms. “We believe that a crane of this type and capacity will enable us to complete hoisting work which has previously been beyond us, for example for the erection of wind turbines”, continues Andrea Caroppi.Magis S.r.l. based in Taranto in southern Italy, has 18 employees. The ISO-certified company has been active with mobile cranes and many other industrial sectors for almost 40 years. Its work includes the installation and maintenance of wind farms, the erection and removal of metal structures, bridges, road and railway viaducts. Its portfolio also includes the assembly of prefabricated houses and the demolition and renovation of steel plants as well as work on cement plants, chemical and petrochemical plants and refineries. Magis’ core national and international business is the completion of large hoists, crane and lifting platform rental as well as special and heavy haulage services. Over the last four years, Magis S.r.l. has pursued the objective of completely updating and expanding its crane fleet. Today its fleet comprises almost exclusively new Liebherr mobile cranes, from the LTM 1100-4.2 to the LTM 1750-9.1. The company already has plans to buy an LTM 1650-8.1..

100 percent Liebherr – Klüttgens expands crane fleet with LTM 1060-3.1,Press releases |04/22/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/100-percent-liebherr-kluettgens-expands-crane-fleet-with-ltm-1060-3-1.html?page=39,"Klüttgens’ fleet is made up in full of Liebherr cranes. It has now added another one in the form of a new LTM 1060-3.1. This will add to the fleet between the 50 and 90 tonne lifting capacity. The compact, manoeuvrable 3-axle crane does not require transport escort on public roads and has a very long telescopic boom at 48 metres.Find out more",Press releases,04/22/2022,"Klüttgens Autokrane + Schwertransporte GmbH based in Stolberg, near the German border with Belgium and the Netherlands, has purchased a new Liebherr LTM 1060-3.1. The crane is the company’s third 3-axle mobile crane from Liebherr and was purchased to expand Klüttgen’s fleet.. Perfectly packed for any roadCompany owner Jens Petry says: “Our 50 tonner is sometimes too small and our 90 tonner too large. What is more, as it is a 3-axle model, this 60 tonner does not need a transport escort.” Special attention was given to the clever arrangement of the ballast slabs on the LTM 1060-3.1. This means that a wide range of driving configurations can be achieved quickly and easily. Its compact dimensions and time-tested ECOmode and ECOdrive make the LTM 1060-3.1 economical to use. In addition to its compact size, the crane features a long telescopic boom and impressive lifting capacities. “With a boom length of 48 metres, this mobile crane is relatively compact but at the same time is manoeuvrable due to its active rear axle steering”, says Petry. This means that all the axles on the vehicle can be steered. The front axles are steered mechanically using the steering wheel. The rear axles are actively steered by an electro-hydraulic system depending on the steering angle and speed. Even at high speed, this ensures very good lane stability and significantly reduced tyre wear.The main work for the new LTM 1060-3.1 at Klüttgens will be unloading and installing prefabricated concrete components and loading machines, for example for machine relocation jobs. In addition, the mobile crane will also be used for the company’s customers in the chemical industry.. 100 percent LiebherrKlüttgens only uses Liebherr mobile cranes. “The customer service and availability of spare parts were important criteria behind the purchase decision as well as the features of the actual crane. We have grown used to this from Liebherr over several decades”, says Petry.Klüttgens Autokrane + Schwertransporte GmbH based in Stolberg has 20 employees. The family-run company is mainly active in the mobile crane rental and heavy haulage sectors. In addition, Klüttgens also carries out machine and company relocations and operates a container service as well as a scrap and metal dealership.

It has invested in two new powerful Liebherr cranes, an LTM 1650-8.1 and an LR 1700-1.0. The 700 tonne crawler crane becomes the company’s new flagship. The main areas of work for the two new cranes will mainly be in wind power and the petrochemicals industry.Find out more",Press releases,04/21/2022,"“Our customers are asking for this type of modern, efficient, flexible machine and we have undertaken to provide a strong answer to this challenge”, says Emilio Molero, Operations Manager at Grúas Leman SA. The Spanish company decided to buy the LTM 1650-8.1 and the LR 1700-1.0 because these crane models represent the latest developments in terms of safety and crane technology. “The massive increase in work that cranes in this performance class have undergone over the last few years was without doubt the trigger for our decision to add these new cranes to our fleet”, continues Emilio Molero.. Innovative constructions for variable crane jobs“The LTM 1650-8.1 will close the gap between our large telescopic cranes and the lattice boom cranes. With its high capacity, easy set-up and economical transport, it will cover the demands of the market in a single crane model”, adds Samuel Molero, Managing Director at Leman. The Liebherr mobile crane is a development of the LTM 1500-8.1 and as such features many of the innovations that Liebherr has developed for its telescopic cranes over the last few years. “Together with improved capacity, VarioBallast® and VarioBase®, the interchangeable booms and other technological innovations, this model enables us to adapt to the needs of every single job. And we can do so with the speed and cost effectiveness that our customers demand of us every day”, continues Emilio Molero.The Liebherr LR 1700-1.0 crawler crane is now the Grúas Leman flagship. At the end of 2021, Grúas Leman was persuaded by the features of the LR 1700-1.0 at the Liebherr Plant in Ehingen and quickly decided to buy the 700 tonne crawler crane. Samuel Molero explains the decision: “The crane has an innovative design and lots of different configurations which simplifies transport and the set-up process massively, making it enormously flexible and economical.”. Crane jobs for wind power and the petrochemicals industry“This type of machine enables us to tackle project of a significant size. This means that despite the current unstable situation, we can plan long term investments and adjust our fleet accordingly”, says Miguel Ángel Malo, who is also a Managing Director at Grúas Leman. The two new Liebherr cranes are primarily destined for work in the wind power sector and the petrochemicals industry which are currently undergoing a phase of expansion and process improvement. The LR 1700-1.0, which will supplement the range of lattice boom cranes at Grúas Leman, will start its working life on projects in Germany where it is due to install turbines with hob heights of up to 165 metres and with a rating of over 5 MW.

“The crane always has another ace up its sleeve”,Press releases |04/19/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-crane-always-has-another-ace-up-its-sleeve.html?page=40,A large pontoon was positioned on a flooded gravel pit as part of the process of expanding a gravel plant in Babenhausen in the German state of Hesse. Crane and heavy haulage contractor Riga Mainz had been awarded this order.Find out more,Press releases,04/19/2022,"To access a new extraction area for gravel and sand, a pontoon measuring over 20 metres in length had to be positioned in a newly flooded gravel pit. The powerful LTM 1650-8.1 mobile crane had already had the floating pontoon on its hook once before in December last year. At that time, it had been removed from a lake several kilometres away from the current location, whose mineral contents had been removed in full.. For positioning the pontoon at the end of March, crane operator Werner Gebel had set up his modern 8-axle machine parallel to the massive load with the lake at its rear. “The crane naturally delivers very high lifting capacity values at the rear. That is particularly the case if I extend the outriggers fully using the VarioBase® program”, explained Gebel. In this mode, the LICCON crane control system calculates the maximum lifting capacity for every boom position. The maximum values are achieved when the crane is operated over its rear outriggers.. In Babenhausen, the challenge for the mobile was to position a gross load of around 70 tonnes into the water at a radius of 25 metres. To achieve this hoist, the LTM 1650-8.1 had been set up with its full slewing platform ballast of 155 tonnes. To enable the pontoon to be hoisted fully over the surface of the water, the hydraulically adjustable ballast radius was increased from 7.40 metres when it picked up the load to the maximum distance of 8.40 metres. Over the next few weeks, a large gravel excavator will be installed on the steel platform.. “The LTM 1650-8.1 demonstrate what is currently feasible” “To attach the large load, we had to work with rope pulleys and fastening equipment of different lengths due to the fact that the centre of gravity was far from central”, explains Riga Mainz Managing Director Uwe Langer, who planned the crane job at the flooded gravel pit in minute detail. “First of all, however, we had to calculate the load case for the hoists using the material thicknesses of the floating section as there were no precise data available about the weight of the pontoon. That then enabled us to develop our hoisting concept. In addition, as a result of how close the crane set-up area was to the edge of the embankment, we had to carry out geological studies of the subsoil. We had to ensure that the ground pressure under the load distribution mats would not cause the soil to collapse.”. His company working out of Mainz has a 120-strong workforce running 40 mobile and crawler cranes and, in addition to crane work, also tackles heavy haulage, special transport and industrial installation work throughout Germany. The LTM 1650-8.1 has been the powerful flagship of Langer’s fleet for the last year. “This crane enables Liebherr to show what is technical feasible today and with the LICCON work planner, the company also provides a tool to make these possibilities into reality”, continues the expert. “The crane continually proves to us that it always has another ace up its sleeve.”.

Strong performers: Liebherr presents new mid-sized wheel loader series,Press releases |04/14/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/strong-performers-liebherr-presents-new-mid-sized-wheel-loader-series.html?page=40,"Liebherr has redeveloped and fundamentally revised its range of mid-sized wheel loaders. The newly-designed lift arm ensures maximum breakout, holding and lowering forces. It has optimised z-bar kinematics and improved working hydraulics. Increases in engine power and tipping loads prepare the wheel loaders for demanding operations in various sectors, such as excavation, recycling or log handling.Find out more",Press releases,04/14/2022,"The three models, L 526, L 538 and L 546, in the latest Generation 8 have bucket sizes between 2.2 and 3.0 m³ in the standard version and are characterised by a significant increase in performance compared to the previous generation. The new L 526, for example, has around 20 percent more engine power and over 20 percent higher breakout forces than its predecessor. The L 538 and L 546 models also impress with performance increases in all areas: for example, with the optimised travel drive, providing increased traction to ensure that the new wheel loaders accelerate dynamically in everyday work, and can penetrate powerfully into all materials. The three models are now available to order from all European Liebherr sales partners.. Powerful and versatile: Newly-developed lift arms with optimised z-bar kinematicsLiebherr has reinforced the steel construction of the front section of the new wheel loaders in order to prepare the machines for handling heavy loads. Structural reinforcements on the new lift arms, for example on the lift arms or the cross tube, increase robustness. The optimised z-bar kinematics with electro-hydraulic pilot controls has larger hydraulic cylinders and more powerful working pumps. The combination of these innovations enables faster cycle times and dynamic and powerful work movements – even with heavy attachments such as high dump buckets or log grapples.With the increased performance providing a strong basis, Liebherr offers numerous equipment options for the lift arms for industry-specific challenges: High Lift lift arms, for example, are an extended variant of the z-bar kinematics, and ensure greater range and efficient loading processes at all heights. For wheel loader applications that regularly require different attachments, there is a view-optimised quick coupler and the fully automatic LIKUFIX quick-coupler system. This allows the machine operator to change between mechanical and hydraulic working tools from the cab quickly and safely at the touch of a button. This saves time and reduces the risk of accidents.. Well thought-out details make day-to-day work with the wheel loaders easier. For example, you can activate the parallel guidance of the lift arms at the push of a button and thus work efficiently and safely with forks. The new bucket-tilt assist helps when working with sticky materials, such as damp soil or compost, and ensures accurate loading by shaking out the bucket. In the course of redesigning the lift arms, Liebherr has also revised the bucket design of the new mid-sized wheel loaders. Consequently, customers can now more accurately tailor the individual elements and wear parts of the buckets to their needs at the time of ordering.. Powerful and modern: Optimised travel drive and intelligent equipmentIn addition to the new lift arms, the optimisation of the hydrostatic travel drive in particular contributes to the increased productivity of the wheel loaders. The new, more powerful engines are characterised by a higher maximum torque at a lower nominal speed. In this way, performance and efficiency can be increased with the same low fuel consumption. More powerful hydraulic components, such as larger travel motors and travel pumps, ensure greater traction in all three models and thus rapid loading cycles. For a high degree of robustness, Liebherr has reinforced the axles, as well as travel drive components; depending on the model, all three wheel loaders have larger front or rear axles than their predecessors.A modern design, which is reflected in the engine bonnet designed for optimised visibility as well as the comfortable operator’s cab, and intelligent equipment are also part of the overall package of the new mid-sized Liebherr wheel loaders. An example of this is the active personnel detection with brake assistant. This optional assistance system, which is installed at the rear of the wheel loader, warns the machine operator visually on the display and with acoustic signals of dangers in the rear area of the wheel loader. In order to provide a specific warning of imminent injury to persons, the assistance system independently distinguishes between humans and objects using smart sensors. As soon as the active personnel detection emits a warning signal, the brake assistant automatically reduces the speed of the wheel loader to a standstill in order to avoid a potential accident..

Crane power for the climate revolution,Press releases |04/11/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/crane-power-for-the-climate-revolution.html?page=40,"Ten months ago, Austrian group Felbermayr started operations with its third Liebherr LR 11000. Since then, the crawler crane has been erecting Enercon wind turbines in Burgenland to the south-east of Vienna. Working with an LR 1750/2, the 1000 tonne crawler crane has erected a total of thirty wind turbines.Find out more",Press releases,04/11/2022,"Renewables are taking on an increasingly important role in supplying electricity within Europe. One of the main sectors in this respect is wind power. Austrian group Felbermayr and its cranes has been involved in this sector for decades and has developed into a major erection contractor for wind turbines, primarily in Austria and Eastern Europe. Felbermayr has 13 large cranes with lifting capacity classes of 600 tonnes and over, primarily working on the construction of these massive wind turbines. All these machines bear the Liebherr logo. Another modern LR 1800-1.0 crawler crane will roll out of the factory in Ehingen during May to expand Felbermayr’s impressive crane fleet.. One hot spot in the process of expanding wind energy is currently around half an hour’s drive to the south-east of Vienna, close to the Slovakian capital Bratislava. Two of Felbermayr’s large cranes in their blue corporate livery are currently operating here in Burgenland, the second main area of wind turbines in Austria alongside Lower Austria. The flagship of the crane fleet, an almost new LR 11000, and an LR 1750/2 equipped with the more powerful SX boom version have been erecting wind turbines with hub heights of up to 160 metres for several months. The cranes hoist three steel tower segments onto the waiting concrete towers and then install the gondola, generator, hub and rotor blades. The work is always carried out when the wind conditions allow. For the LR 1750/2, the more powerful SX boom increases the maximum permitted windspeed from nine to ten metres per second to ensure less downtime during the assembly work. At this windy level of the area known as the Vienna Basin, waiting times which can last for weeks, are a major challenge to the crane crews and erection teams.To ensure that the ambitious schedule is met (all the crane work should be completed by the end of the year), a second 1000 tonne crawler crane from the Austrian group will arrive shortly to help. The two LR 11000 cranes will then be in action at the same time just a few kilometres apart.. 140 tonne hoists possible with a small amount of suspended ballast “We are actually building slightly larger systems with a rating of 5.5 megawatts for which the cranes have to hoist the generator, for example, weighing around 130 tonnes to a height of 155 metres,” says Oliver Masch, Enercon’s General Project Manager at the site. “The gross load case is then slightly over 140 tonnes”, adds Jan Kürner, Supervisor and Site Manager at Felbermayr. “To do this, the VarioTray with around 100 tonnes of ballast, which we call the “Baby Tray” because of its size, is extended to its maximum radius of 30 metres. The large suspended ballast pallet containing a further 450 tonnes of weight remains suspended throughout the erection process and is only required to raise or lower the boom, which measures over 180 metres in length.”. In view of the fact that waiting times are often quite long due to strong winds and powerful gusts, it is extremely important for the project management team that the crane operations go smoothly. “The time frames with wind speeds in which we can hoist and install components often open and close very quickly, sometimes even on an hourly basis”, explains Oliver Masch. That means that time-consuming ballast in work can be a real hindrance, of course. The highly flexible V-Frame means that this work is simply not necessary on the LR  11000 at the wind farm. Urgency is always the order of the day. “And if we actually have a crane defect at any time”, continues Oliver Masch, “we are very satisfied with the service we received from Liebherr. Generally, it is only a matter of hours. But the reliability of the Liebherr cranes is almost perfect anyway.”Supervisor Jan Kürner is also extremely impressed with the LR 11000 and its great flexibility: “I operated the first crane of this type that we purchased in 2014 myself for several years. It is a modern crane and has a very compact design and is much easier and therefore also safer to set up older cranes. And now with the V-frame – it truly is a top quality crane.”. “V-Frame means that the crane is no longer the limiting factor” So when it really becomes necessary, the disconnecting derrick ballast and the hydraulically adjustable frame make it possible to work at very high speed. Or as Gernold Mailänder, the operator of the LR 11000, puts it: “The crane is no longer the limiting factor for getting on with the job. When the wind speeds are suitable, I can position one component after another without having to adjust the ballast in between. That means I can complete a wind turbine in just three or four days.” The experienced expert sits satisfied in his large operator’s cab. “The V-Frame is tip top. There is absolutely nothing to be said against it.”. Heavy loads, mega transports, massive infrastructure and special projects – the Felbermayr Holding GmbH portfolio contains all this and more. The company has expanded massively, above all in the states of Austria, over the last 30 years. The Austrian company’s empire now encompasses 75 sites in 19 countries throughout Europe..

Game changer – LR 12500-1.0 added to Liebherr’s portfolio of large crawler cranes,Press releases |04/07/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/game-changer-lr-12500-1-0-added-to-liebherrs-portfolio-of-large-crawler-cranes.html?page=41,"Liebherr has unveiled its latest crawler crane with the slogan “Game changer for tomorrow’s energy” – the LR 12500-1.0 with a capacity of 2,500 tonnes supplements the portfolio below the LR 13000. The design of the slewing platform and the main boom sets new standards as the uniquely wide main boom gives the crane the stability of a PowerBoom.Find out more",Press releases,04/07/2022,"The demand from the market for large crawler cranes is growing, for example in the petrochemicals industry and port handling involving enormous components for offshore applications. Driven by the energy revolution, part weights are increasing all the time, particularly when handling components for offshore wind turbines. Liebherr has decided to meet this challenge with a new crawler crane – the LR 12500-1.0 will be added to the portfolio of lattice boom cranes between the 1,350 tonne LR 11350 and the LR 13000 which has a lifting capacity of 3,000 tonnes. With its enormous lifting capacities and unique transport concept, it has been designed as an economical crawler crane for global projects.. Maximum capacity with HighPerformanceBoomThe key to high lifting capacities are wide lattice booms. The solutions to date have been a double boom like the PowerBoom or the widespread SX systems. However, the Liebherr designers chose a completely different path in the design process for the LR 12500-1.0 – the wide, powerful HighPerfomanceBoom is introduced into the turntable in an optimized way. This is made possible by a special superstructure front section, which is transported on a low-bed trailer at a width of 4 meters.The slewing platform is supplemented by a 3.5 metre wide rear section which is also home to the two power units. Two Liebherr 6-cylinder in-line engines deliver a total of 800 kW/1088 bhp. They have a redundant design to increase the crane's availability. There is no separate power pack. The two main hoist winches are also on this rear section.. Smart solutions for economical transportThe intermediate sections of the HighPerfomanceBoom each measure 10 metres in length and are reduced to an economical transport size by a refined mechanism. A separate device stabilises the lattice section during the erection process on site.The chain is removed and transported in containers for transporting the crawler carriers, each of which weigh around 150 tonnes. The remaining chain girder is divided and moved on two low loaders. The 25 tonne ballast slabs are identical to those used on the LR 13000. They have the same dimensions of a 20 foot container to ensure they can be transported particularly economically and can be loaded using a spreader.The LR 12500-1.0 is designed for a transport width of 3.5 metres. Only two components of the new 2,500 tonne crane have a transport width of 4 metres.. Modular boom systemThe maximum hook height of around 200 metres is achieved by the new LR 12500-1.0 using a 100 metre main boom and a 108 metre luffing jib. Installed with a short length, the luffing jib also acts as a particularly powerful WV jib. The “vessel lifter” is ideal for the erection of long columns in petrochemical plants.The maximum 110 metre HighPerformanceBoom can be extended to a 155 metre boom using parts of the luffing jib. The ballast pallet on the derrick boom of the LR 13000 acts as suspended ballast. If the crane has to operate without suspended ballast in constricted conditions, it can also operate without derrick ballast in what is known as a B0 version. This principle has also been adopted from the LR 13000. The suspended ballast is infinitely adjusted with the derrick boom. The ballast radius can be extended to the maximum radius with a rigid guide.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The Belgian global contractor is convinced by the concept and performance of the new 2500 tonne crawler crane and will primarily be using it in the renewables industry, for example for handling offshore wind turbines.Find out more",Press releases,04/07/2022,"Liebherr consulted closely with its customers in the heavy load sector in its efforts to develop a concept for a new crawler crane between the LR 11350 with a lifting capacity of 1350 tonnes and the 3000 tonne LR 13000. The result is the new LR 12500-1.0 with a maximum lifting capacity of 2,500 tonnes. Liebherr and its customers believe there is a great deal of potential in this class and a growing market for large crawler cranes.The new LR 12500-1.0 also marks Liebherr’s response to increasing market requirements for large crawler cranes for the petrochemicals industry and port handling. Handling enormous components for offshore wind turbines at ports, in particular, has become an important area of work for large crawler cranes. With its lifting capacity, the new 2,500 tonne crawler crane has also been designed to cover future requirements. Interest in the new LR 12500-1.0 is correspondingly high.Sarens was quickly convinced by the concept and performance of the new 2,500-tonners and ordered the first unit. Managing Director Carl Sarens says: “The high lifting capacity of the LR 12500-1.0 is the outstanding feature for us. The new crane will enable us to close the gap between our crawler and ringer cranes. We are particularly focussing on jobs in renewables for the new 2,500 tonne crane. Handling offshore wind turbines at ports is also becoming a much more important business segment and the weights of components continues to rise.”In developing the transport concept, Liebherr ensured that the new crawler crane can be used economically throughout the world.

"Zero emission, full power – Liebherr LTC 1050-3.1 mobile crane with electric power unit",Press releases |04/06/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/zero-emission-full-power-liebherr-ltc-1050-3-1-mobile-crane-with-electric-power-unit.html?page=41,"The accelerating climate revolution demands drive concepts to be used in the construction industry which reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. To meet the needs of customers and the demand for greener equipment as well as possible, Liebherr is working on alternative drive units, which are perfectly tailored to the application and location of the machine, without focusing on a single technology.Find out more",Press releases,04/06/2022,"Liebherr developed the electric power unit for the LTC 1050-3.1 using the slogan “Zero emission, full power”. Dr Ulrich Hamme, Technical Director at Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH, says: “We want to be able to offer our customers full crane performance even with the alternative electric power unit. The LTC 1050-3.1 still has a conventional internal combustion engine, powered by diesel or HVO, for driving on roads and for crane operations. However, as an alternative it also has an electric power unit for crane operations so that it generates “Zero emission”. That means that all the familiar usage properties of the crane will be retained, regardless of whether the crane operations are powered by its zero emission electric motor or its internal combustion engine.”. Maximum flexibility for full green credentials and customer benefits The new alternative LTC 1050-3.1 delivers the best possible combination of green credentials, customer benefits and efficiency. On the road and off-road, it has a conventional, low emissions internal combustion engine which complies with emissions stage 5 and develops 243 kW (326 bhp). The engine can be fuelled with hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) with absolutely no restrictions, enabling it to reduce its CO2 emissions by up to 90 % compared to fuelling it with diesel.Either the engine or the electric motor can be selected in crane mode depending on the conditions for the job. The latter reduces both air and noise emissions to a minimum. This also means that the machine is suitable for use in noise-sensitive areas and in “zero emission areas”.. Simple, clever electric motor concept – flexible electric power unit The newly developed power unit featuring an electric motor develops 72 kW and therefore enables the crane to be operated without restriction, in other words with almost the same performance as using the 6-cylinder engine. The electric motor uses the existing hydraulic pump, which is mounted direct on the powershift transmission on the conventional LTC 1050-3.1, to transfer the power to the consumers in the crane superstructure.Only the electric motor and a distributor gear as well as the required control equipment must be added to the conventional LTC 1050-3.1 model to transform it into an electric version. The distributer gear is located directly between the crane pump and the powershift transmission. This clever yet simple solution enables the operator to switch flexibly between diesel-hydraulic power and electro-hydraulic power. Site current at 125 A is required to achieve full performance, but the crane also operates very well with a 63 A supply. Alternatively, the crane can operate using an external conventional battery pack if the site does not have the appropriate electrical infrastructure.Liebherr supplies the electric model of the LTC 1050-3.1 for the version with the 36 metre TELEMATIK telescopic boom. The RemoteDrive option for remote-controlled driving and height-adjustable elevating cab are also available for the new crane. The prototype with the electric power unit is currently undergoing intensive testing and Liebherr is planning to deliver the first models in 2023..

Liebherr’s MDC3 camera – The best choice for Sandvik,Press releases |04/05/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr%E2%80%99s-mdc3-camera-%E2%80%93-the-best-choice-for-sandvik.html?page=41,"The Swedish group Sandvik supplies tools and equipment for various areas, such as metal cutting, mining and rock excavation. Due to the rough environmental conditions in underground mines, the company relies on proven robust and reliable components. Stress tests conducted by Sandvik showed that Liebherr's digital smart camera is ideally suited for demanding operating conditions. In addition, the camera reliably ensures easy viewing, even in very dark underground mining environments.Find out more",Press releases,04/05/2022,"Sandvik’s Mechanical Cutting Division located in Zeltweg (Austria) is a global market leader in roadheaders. Construction companies around the world choose these powerful machines for cavity construction in car and railway tunnels, among other applications. The cutting process in underground mining produces strong vibrations and immense quantities of dust. Therefore, smooth operation requires high-quality components that are robust and reliable enough to master these highly demanding conditions.“The enormous forces at play in underground mining pose great challenges on the components in our machines. We, therefore, subject the components to intensive tests before we use them in our machines. Liebherr’s MDC3 convinced us in particular due to its high quality and robustness”, says Uwe Restner, product manager for roadheaders and digitalisation at Sandvik.. Intense testing of the componentsSandvik has extensively tested the suitability of the MDC3 digital smart camera for underground mining. It also underwent a demanding vibration test and came out on top as the best-equipped camera. It also performed convincingly well under heavy shock loads without any failure or impairment.Development of tele-remote operationSandvik also wants its machines to be compatible with tele-remote operation in the future. This requires a high-resolution camera and, above all, reliable 360° viewing – even under heavy vibrations. Due to the blind angle, failure of the camera would require immediate interruption of the tele-remote operation for safety reasons, and thus result in downtimes.“The most decisive factors in the choice of the camera, besides its robustness, were its reliability and latency. The MDC3 has proven to reliably deliver images to our displays, with minimal delays. This will be key to future tele-remote operation”, added Uwe Restner. In addition, the MDC3 proves its worth globally in challenging industries such as construction machinery, agriculture or mining.Digging in SwitzerlandIn Bern (Switzerland), Marti Tunnel AG is using a Sandvik MT520 roadheader to dig new caverns for a railway station project. The machine has an operating weight of 115 tonnes and an output of 537 kW. The MT520 is equipped with a unique telescopic arm, which enables cavity construction to a height of 7.1 metres and a width of 10.3 metres.Six Liebherr cameras are installed on the MT520 for comfortable 360° viewing in the operator's cab: two in the front with a view of the telescopic boom, two on the sides and two more for rear-view monitoring. With its integrated high-performance imager, the MDC3 shows all the necessary information right on the display, even in very dark environments with an illuminance of 1 millilux.One innovative solution devised by Sandvik illustrates the harsh environment during cutting: Dirt deposits from water and dust normally crystallise to form an opaque layer on the camera that clouds viewing. Sandvik’s underground specialist has therefore installed an air nozzle in front of the Liebherr camera to prevent the layer from building up.Long-term availabilityDespite the challenging operating conditions, Sandvik’s high-quality machines are designed to stay operational for 20 years, at an utilisation rate of up to 80. As partners, Liebherr and Sandvik complement each other ideally here, because Liebherr’s robust components are highly durable, as well..

"Stevenson Crane, Rigging, and Heavy Haul adds Liebherr LR 1500 Crawler Crane to fleet in 2022",Press releases |04/05/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/stevenson-crane-rigging-and-heavy-haul-adds-liebherr-lr-1500-crawler-crane-to-fleet-in-2022.html?page=41,The LR 1500 crawler crane delivers load capacity of a 500 metric tonne (550 USt) model with the dimensions and weights of a 400 metric tonne (440 USt) crane providing better capacity and easy transport for the midwest company.Find out more,Press releases,04/05/2022,"Founded in 1989, Stevenson Crane, Rigging, and Heavy Haul (Stevenson) will add Liebherr’s LR 1500 to its growing fleet in 2022. Stevenson mainly serves customers within the commercial, large residential, and heavy industrial markets. The company chose to acquire this crawler crane to better serve their diverse customer base and expand their overall crawler division.The LR 1500 was designed with simplicity and economy in mind. With a maximum transport weight under 100,000 lbs and compact shipping dimensions, the crawler crane provides economical transport and easy set up for Stevenson jobsites in and around the Chicago area.Stevenson relies on Liebherr’s state-of-the-art, innovative equipment for lifting needs within each industry they provide services. While remaining compact in size, the LR 1500 manages load capacity increase of approximately 28% on the 84 m (275 ft) main boom compared to its predecessor the LR 1400/2. A comparison of the configuration of the 84 m (275 ft) main boom with an 84 m (275 ft) luffing jib means the new crane actually manages an increase of 55% on average.. The “Powerful – Compact – Simple” crane is not only easy to set up and operate, but also features an adjustable derrick system ranging from 9 meters (30 ft) to 16 meters (52ft), allowing the crane to work in constricted spaces while maximizing lift capacity. The 30 m derrick boom (98ft) and 260 tonne derrick ballast (286 USt) provide ideal performance for Stevenson operators.President of Stevenson, Donna Stevenson noted, “Stevenson Crane, Rigging, and Heavy Haul always provides the most innovative, safe, and cost-effective equipment to our customers.

Liebherr: Significant boost in turnover of the Liebherr Group in 2021 ,Press releases |04/04/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-significant-boost-in-turnover-of-the-liebherr-group-in-2021.html?page=41,"In 2021, the Liebherr Group achieved a turnover of € 11,639 million. Compared to the previous year, the company posted an overall increase of € 1,298 million or 12.6 %. As a result, the Liebherr Group was almost able to match its previous record year in 2019 in terms of annual turnover.Find out more",Press releases,04/04/2022,"The conditions in the past financial year were also difficult for manufacturing companies. From the second quarter in 2021, to some extent, it was extremely difficult to procure various raw materials, components and electronic parts. This resulted in price increases and bottlenecks in the global supply chains. Despite that, Liebherr recorded a significant increase in sales revenues compared to the previous year. The Liebherr Group grew in eleven of its 13 product segments and in almost all of its sales regions.Revenues in the earthmoving, material handling technology, deep foundation machines, mobile and crawler cranes, tower cranes, concrete technology and mining product segments were 17 % higher than in the previous year at € 8,009 million. In the other product segments, including maritime cranes, aerospace and transportation systems, gear technology and automation systems, refrigerators and freezers, as well as components and hotels, Liebherr achieved total revenues of € 3,630 million, a 3.9 % increase compared to the previous year.Sales increased in the European Union, which has traditionally been the Group's strongest sales region. High growth rates were recorded in almost all EU markets, with France in particular showing above average development. Outside the EU, there was a marked rise in sales in the United Kingdom, among other regions. Positive development was also seen in North America, as well as Central America and South America, where strong growth came especially from Brazil. The Liebherr Group faced declines in Africa, as well as in the Near and Middle East, whereas the financial year in Asia and Oceania ended with a moderate rise.In 2021, the Liebherr Group achieved a net profit for the year of € 545 million, a value above the level before the pandemic. Operating results and the financial result grew considerably compared to the previous year. The 2021 business year also saw a significant increase in the number of employees. At the end of the year, the Liebherr Group employed 49,611 people worldwide. Compared to the previous year, this constituted an increase of 1,686.. Traditionally high investments in research and developmentAs a technology company, the Liebherr Group pursues the goal of making a decisive contribution to technological progress in the sectors relevant for the Group. Liebherr invested € 559 million in research and development last year. The bulk of this was used in the development of new products. Numerous cooperative ventures with universities, or higher education institutions and research institutes were initiated or continued.Alternative drive technologies continue to be a focal point of the research projects at Liebherr. The Liebherr Group takes a technology neutral approach. In 2021, it worked, for example, on hydrogen-powered combustion engines and their injection technologies, as well as electric drives. For instance, Liebherr expanded its portfolio of construction machines with electric drives with two all-electric truck mixers on five-axle chassis frames, the two electric crawler excavators R 976-E and R 980 SME-E and the battery-powered crawler cranes LR 1160.1 unplugged and LR 1130.1 unplugged both with zero local emissions. The start of the development phase of the first all-electric offshore crane marked the launch of the electrification of the product portfolio in this area. Furthermore, Liebherr prepared various product lines for the use of hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO) as a fuel. The Ehingen and Kirchdorf an der Iller sites (both in Germany) are now already fuelling all machines with the climate-neutral fuel ex works as standard.Digitalisation was another focal point of R&D activities. Among others, a new range of refrigerators and freezers with resource-friendly freshness technology and digital networking was launched. In addition, in several product segments, the existing technologies were optimised for remote control, automation and networking and the Liebherr-Remote-Service App was extended. It is also worth highlighting the development of two assist systems for mining trucks, which offer automatic steering assistance, reduce the strain on the driver, and lower fuel consumption.. Investments in production, sales and serviceThe Group invested € 742 million in its production sites and its global distribution and service networks. The level of investment increased by € 137 million compared to last year. Offset against this was depreciation of € 507 million. In the concrete technology product segment, a new production plant went into operation: Liebherr-Concrete Technology Marica EOOD in Plovdiv (Bulgaria) supplies Liebherr-Mischtechnik GmbH in Bad Schussenried (Germany) with pre-assemblies and steel constructions for truck mixers. To further expand its presence in the Asian market and meet the high demand from the wind and construction industries, the Group began construction of a new components plant in China: Liebherr Components (Dalian) Co., Ltd. will produce slewing bearings, gearboxes and hydraulic cylinders at the Dalian site, starting at the end of 2022. Last year also saw the construction of a new assembly line for gearboxes in India. In addition, a largescale expansion was approved for the plant in Ehingen (Germany). Step-by-step, investments will be made in the expansion until 2030 in order to significantly increase its production capacity and meet the rising demand for mobile and crawler cranes.In parallel, the Group continued to expand its sales and service infrastructure. In Austria, new logistics centres were established in Telfs and Bischofshofen, and the building work on a new sales centre for construction machines started in Puch / Urstein. In Dettingen / Iller (Germany), Liebherr added a new office and repair facility to expand its sales and service infrastructure for construction machines.Outlook for 2022The Liebherr Group has started 2022 with a very good order situation. Opportunities arise from the expected increase in demand in the various industrial sectors in which the Liebherr Group is active. However, the negative effects on the activities of the Liebherr Group due to the war in Ukraine can already be seen. Liebherr is monitoring and assessing the current situation in Ukraine and Russia on a daily basis and is currently in the process of adjusting its Russian activities to the extensive sanctions imposed on the country. At the same time, there are still uncertainties with regard to the pandemic-related restrictions, the effects of steep price increases for many goods and services, shortages of certain raw materials and the lack of skilled workers, as well as bottlenecks in different supply chains. It is also unclear how fiscal and monetary policy measures will ultimately affect the Liebherr Group. Despite the difficult conditions, Liebherr is cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year.On Monday, 4 April 2022, the Liebherr Group publishes its current annual report. In addition to detailed figures, it contains a magazine section reviewing the past financial year. In an interview, Dr. h.c. Dipl.-Kfm. Isolde Liebherr, Dr. h.c. Dipl.-Ing. (ETH) Willi Liebherr, Philipp Liebherr and Stéfanie Wohlfarth give their summary for 2021.The annual report of the Liebherr Group can be found online at www.liebherr.com/liebherr-annual-report.

ESTA Awards: LR 1400 SX wins,Press releases |03/30/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/esta-awards-lr-1400-sx-wins.html?page=42,The ESTA Awards are the highest distinction for the crane and heavy-lift industry. This year’s award for the category “Safety” was won by the LR 1400 SX. A crawler crane from Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH has thus secured an award two years in succession.Find out more,Press releases,03/30/2022,"“Safety was always an important part of our product development. In recent years, we have focused even more strongly on this with digital solutions and assistance systems. It is important for us that those who operate our cranes feel safe on the jobsite. We want to continue to successfully follow this path,” says Gerhard Frainer, Managing Director for Sales at Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH, during the awards ceremony.The LR 1400 SX extends the range of crawler cranes from Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH to include lifting capacities up to 400 t. The crane designers paid particular attention to the safety concept.Highest level of safetyThe assistance system Gradient Travel Aid helps to negotiate slopes and inclines. It displays the crane’s centre of gravity and warns the operator before the crane leaves the safe area.The Ground Pressure Visualization of the LR 1400 SX calculates the current ground pressure of the crane in real time and compares it with the specified safety limits of the relevant position. The ground pressure is displayed in the operator’s cabin. This means the operator is permanently aware of whether the machine is situated in, or is approaching, a critical area.When erecting or lowering the boom, the Boom Up-and-Down Assistant indicates the approach to the tipping border and automatically stops operation before the operator unintentionally enters an unsafe zone.“The winning LR 1400 SX is only one example of maximum safety. All our cranes in the LR series are equipped with the same safety systems and fulfil the same criteria. The award is an expression of appreciation for our commitment to safe crawler cranes and construction machinery,” says Gerhard Frainer..

Fourth generation of 90 tonne cranes – Saller takes delivery of Liebherr LTM 1090-4.2,Press releases |03/28/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/fourth-generation-of-90-tonne-cranes-saller-takes-delivery-of-liebherr-ltm-1090-4-2.html?page=42,"Liebherr cranes have been part of Kranverleih Saller GmbH ever since the company was founded. The new addition is the fourth generation of 90 tonne cranes within the last four decades for the company based in Winhöring. Initially, cranes in this capacity class had chassis with six axles. Technical progress means that the same performance is now possible from four-axle mobile cranes. The LTM 1090-4.2 features a 60 metre telescopic boom. Its flexible axle loads mean that it can be used economically throughout the world. Saller plans to use the new crane primarily in the chemical industry.Find out more",Press releases,03/28/2022,"Kranverleih Saller GmbH has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1090-4.2 at its head office in Winhöring in Bavaria. “This crane is now the fourth generation of Liebherr 90 tonne cranes our company has owned. The first, which we bought in 1981, was an LT 1090 truck crane on six axles with a 40 metre telescopic boom”, says outgoing Managing Director Johann Saller. He passed his position on to his brothers Herbert Saller and Nikolaus Saller at the turn of the year. Since the eighties, Liebherr has gradually replaced the LT truck cranes with its LTM all-terrain cranes. The first 90 tonne model in the LTM series was a 5-axle type. The current 90 tonne cranes have just four axles and are significantly lighter and more mobile. Thanks to technical progress, the same lifting capacity is now possible with two fewer axles than on the original LT truck crane – despite the fact that the modern crane has a significantly longer telescopic boom. “The LTM 1090-4.2 with its 60 metre main boom and the ballast which it can carry within its 48 tonne gross weight is now the perfect machine for this lifting capacity class for our customers in the chemical industry”, adds Saller.Economical all-rounderThe LTM 1090-4.2 can be operated economically all over the world. It can travel with axle loads of 10 tonnes, 12 tonnes and 16 tonnes. As a result of its single-engine strategy, the reduced weight from not having a superstructure engine enables a longer boom and more ballast to be used with an axle load of 12 tonnes. The boom is 60 metres long, in other words ten metres longer than its direct predecessor, the LTM 1090-4.1. With an axle load of 12 tonnes, the new crane carries 8.8 tonnes of ballast, 2.1 tonnes more than its predecessor. That enables transport work and costs to be reduced in addition to its higher capacity. Thanks to ECOdrive and ECOmode, the LTM 1090-4.2 is eco-friendly and has lower fuel consumption and noise emission values. Its innovative VarioBallast® system enables the crane to be operated with two ballast radii.Liebherr continues to beat its competitors after the sale“Buying from the market leader Liebherr, means that we have a very competent supplier with outstanding after-sales service, high spare parts availability and a practical approach to complaints”, says Saller. This includes well trained service technicians, emergency services available at all times and the global availability of 95 percent of all spare parts within 24 hours.Liebherr cranes from the very outsetKranverleih Saller GmbH was founded in 1966 as a recovery and towing contractor. In 1978, Johann Saller became the first full-time employee at his father’s company. That was also the year that the company bought its first Liebherr crane from Ehingen, an LT 1035. The business relationship has grown over the decades. Saller has now purchased well over 100 Liebherr cranes and the company’s workforce has grown to more than 40. In addition to its head office in Winhöring, Saller has two additional outlets in the area known as the south-east Bavarian chemical triangle. This region is home to the relatively large number of companies active in the chemical industry and also to refineries. The main areas of work for Kranverleih Saller GmbH are therefore expansion and refurbishment work at these companies. Saller has many years of experience in this industry and meets the highest safety requirements which apply in this sector.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr on-board in new air-free Siemens Brake System,Press releases |03/25/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-on-board-in-new-air-free-siemens-brake-system.html?page=42,"Liebherr has been selected by rolling stock manufacturer Siemens Mobility for a joint development and the delivery of a key component of their new air-free Siemens Brake System: the electro-hydraulic brake actuator, which provides the brake force for the brake system. Unlike the conventional pneumatic brake, with the new air-free Siemens Brake System the control of the brake is fully electrical – “brake-by-wire” –, which means that all piping and all pneumatic components for controlling the brake can be eliminated.Find out more",Press releases,03/25/2022,"In close collaboration with Siemens Liebherr developed and produces a compact, closed, electrohydraulic brake actuator including all the components necessary to build-up and release the brake force as well as local control. The brake actuator is integrated in the bogie in the same installation space and has the same mechanical interfaces as the conventional pneumatic brake caliper. This brake actuator meets the highest safety requirements and Safety Integrity Levels up to SIL4 and also the latest rules and regulations for safety verification. The brake actuator is derived from the technology that Liebherr developed for aerospace flight control actuation applications.As Mr. Jens Lichterfeld, Senior Expert Brakes at Siemens Mobility puts it: “Using the air-free brake results in a number of benefits on car-level, including reduced weight and reduced effort for installation and commissioning of the brake system. In addition, installation space that was previously required for the air brake components can now be used for other subsystems. That’s extremely useful when it comes to vehicle development"". In operation, efforts can be reduced in several areas like maintenance, train’s start-up time and shortening of headways.Siemens Mobility is implementing the new brake technology for the first time on the X-Wagen metro project in Vienna (Austria).According to Mr. Robert Steinfelder, Vice President Siemens Brakes at Siemens Mobility: “Wiener Linien will then be the first transit authority in the world to benefit from our brake system, both in conventional operation with a driver and later in automated operation on the new U5 Line.”.

While this family-run organisation has undergone many changes to date, its core objective of ensuring customer satisfaction through the quality of its products and services has remained unchanged. Just eight years after it was founded, Comat became a distributor for Liebherr earth-moving machines in 1980.Find out more",Press releases,03/25/2022,"In 1980, Liebherr was looking for a new partner to distribute its earth-moving equipment in Luxembourg. When Jacques Conter heard the news, he wrote a letter directly to Liebherr-Export AG. Two weeks later, the two companies started their adventure together. An alliance of two family-run groups, the partnership between Liebherr and Comat soon bore fruit.The first machines to be sold were an A 922 wheeled excavator for Sotraroute and an LR 631 for Perrard.Claude Conter, son of Jacques and the company’s current director, is very happy with the partnership between Comat and the Liebherr brand: “It’s a very good partnership”, he says. “These two family-run companies are reliable and stable. We consistently plough our profits back into investments that will secure our future.”. R 924 G8 crawler excavator celebrates Comat's 50th anniversaryThe Conter family have chosen an R 924 G8 crawler excavator from the Liebherr-France SAS production site at Colmar. With its characteristic generation 8 design, this machine features a completely reconfigured architecture to offer even better comfort, ergonomics and operating performance.Our Luxembourg distributor chose a custom version in its company livery and featuring a special 50th anniversary logo.

Comat and Liebherr: past and futureSince its foundation, Comat has made a name for itself with the main players in the construction sector in Luxembourg. It has also enjoyed a high profile through its involvement with numerous quarry projects in the country.Comat, is a valued local partner, highly regarded in its own country for its technical expertise and very fast service, but also and above all for the very close and trusting relationships that it maintains with its customers just as much as with Liebherr.Claude Conter recalls nostalgically: “In 1990, I did several months of practical training at the Liebherr-France plant in Colmar, and that allowed me to understand the Liebherr way of thinking and working. Our technicians also regularly attend training at the various Liebherr manufacturing facilities to acquire in-depth and up-to-date knowledge of the Liebherr world.“With over 100 employees, Comat has grown considerably in 50 years. Along with a steady, permanent customer base in its sector, this Luxembourg company launched a rental service about a decade ago. With excavators from 14 to 40 tonnes, the Comat Location fleet runs to more than 50 vehicles. It also includes wheeled loaders and crawler tractors, making up a complete range to cater for heavy demand from customers in Luxembourg.

The refrigeration and freezing specialist has once again succeeded in combining uncompromising quality and elegant appearance with intelligent freshness technology, energy efficiency and intuitive, convenient operation.Find out more",Press releases,03/24/2022,"“We develop refrigeration and freezing solutions that simplify everyday life for our customers and fulfil their requirements with regard to freshness and design,” says Steffen Nagel, Managing Director Sales & Marketing at Liebherr-Hausgeräte GmbH. “The result of this development is our new generation of freestanding appliances that combines intelligent freshness technology with an elegant, modern design in the highest quality.”. Elegant design for every kitchen environmentThe new freestanding appliances from Liebherr stand out thanks to their linear design and attractive surfaces made from high-quality materials. The exceptional designs range from clear white and beige colours to SteelFinish with a sophisticated slick steel look to traditional StainlessSteel and the unmistakable BlackSteel finish.All fridges and freezers in the new range have a closed aluminium rear panel giving them a sophisticated look on all sides. The newly developed, clever InteriorFit design element allows every freestanding appliance to fit perfectly in a 60 cm deep niche without requiring space for ventilation as they have an integrated door hinge that is invisible from the outside. This means that only the elegant front door of the cooling appliance protrudes, enabling it to blend in harmoniously with the room.Liebherr divides its new freestanding appliance range into the Pure and Plus entry-level series and the Prime and Peak premium ranges that are fitted with different equipment options and that were introduced with the new generation of fully integrated appliances.. Intelligent technology for long-lasting freshnessOne particularly impressive feature of the new freestanding appliances is their freshness technology. Liebherr offers just the right storage options to keep sensitive vitamins and nutrients fresh for longer with EasyFresh, BioFresh and BioFresh Professional. The perfect combination of temperature and air humidity ensures optimum foodstuff cooling. They retain their authentic taste for longer and need to be thrown away less frequently, thereby avoiding food wastage.Liebherr has developed a separate compartment – the BioFresh Professional Fish & Seafood safe – that has been designed especially for the improved storage of fish and seafood at -2 degrees Celsius and that can be individually controlled. The fine HydroBreeze freshness mist ensures fruit and vegetables stay even fresher in the Peak series cooling appliances. The integrated water dispenser and InfinitySpring filter system provide a constant supply of fresh water direct from the fridge, meaning you no longer have to lug heavy crates or buy plastic bottles.Liebherr also uses elegant stainless steel on the interior of the cooling appliances. For example, the models of the top-of-the-range Peak series are fitted with SmartSteel throughout the interior. This cladding creates a particularly hygienic storage environment as undesired moisture and food freezing to the appliance are avoided by air circulation between the rear panel and stainless steel interior. At the same time, customers will appreciate the incomparable look every time they open the appliance. The LED ambient lighting of the fan on the rear panel and the flush-mounted LightTower in the side walls ensures that the interior and foodstuffs are perfectly illuminated. The rear panel of the Prime series appliances are also clad with SmartSteel.German engineering: energy efficiency and quality from LiebherrAll fridges and freezers in the new Liebherr freestanding appliance range were designed in Germany and manufactured in Europe. They represent the high quality standards of the Liebherr Group as well as its appliance division which was founded by Hans Liebherr in Germany in 1954.Thanks to their intelligent, energy-saving cooling concepts, many models in the new freestanding appliance range have again been placed in the top energy efficiency classes. At the same time, the appliances offer the greatest possible cooling volume thanks to BluPerformance, as the entire cooling technology is located in the base and works at an exceptionally low noise level.All models are fitted with an intuitive user interface that ensures maximum operating convenience and enables the user to adjust functions individually. The freestanding appliances are either network-capable ex works or can be retrofitted with the SmartDeviceBox and then connected to the domestic SmartHome system.The new appliances from the refrigeration and freezing specialist are genuine all-rounders. In addition to low power consumption and noise levels they also offer optimum cooling performance with a great capacity and a long service life thanks to the use of high-quality materials.Freezing as required with the new freestanding freezers and fridge-freezersThe Prime and Peak series freezers combine two appliances in one with the VarioTemp feature; their temperature zones can be set individually from -2 degrees Celsius to +14 degrees Celsius. They can be used both as freezers as well as additional fridge compartments and give the user the utmost flexibility.The new Liebherr freestanding freezers are fitted with a wide range of special ice features: Bottles and pizza boxes can be kept upright in the IceTower, while an integrated IceMaker produces enough ice for drinks. The Plus, Prime and Peak series all come with the EasyTwist Ice function: Ice cubes can be made in a simple and hygienic manner within five hours in a removable container without a permanent water connection.All Liebherr fridge-freezers are equipped with DuoCooling and therefore with two individually adjustable cooling circuits. The proven NoFrost technology can be found in the base of the appliance on the new models and is easy to access if required. In addition to this, FrostProtect is integrated in all freezer compartments. This gives customers greater flexibility with regard to the choice of installation position as the appliance also works perfectly at an ambient temperature of down to -15 °C..

A requirement that the new LR 1100.1 fulfils perfectly making it the ideal multi-purpose crane on any construction site.Find out more,Press releases,03/22/2022,"The new crawler crane LR 1100.1 is optimised for all typical lifting applications in the 100-tonne category. It can be configured either with a main boom up to 62 m, or with a main boom up to 44 m in combination with a fixed jib up to 20 m.The LR 1100.1 is fitted with the most powerful engine in its class - 230 kW provide the necessary performance for the lifting operations. Thanks to the Eco-Silent Mode, the engine speed can be reduced to a predefined level. This means that diesel consumption and noise emission are reduced; nevertheless the performance remains the same. The Automatic Engine Stop Control offers a further economic and environmentally friendly solution. After checking certain system functions, the engine is switched off during longer work interruptions.Everything in viewThe crawler crane is optimised for quick transfer between construction sites. The transport width is 2,983 mm or 3,500 mm, depending on whether the crane is transported with or without crawlers. At the construction site, the assembly of the LR 1100.1 is simplified through the self-assembly system and radio remote control.Radio remote control allows the crane operator a high degree of flexibility and additional safety even during operation. The crane can be operated from outside the cabin and so allow for a better overview of the construction site. So-called blind spots can thus be better avoided. Depending on the application, a second person is no longer required to assist with hand signals during lifting operations. The cabin of the new crawler crane can be elevated by 2.8 m thus allowing for a good all-round view.Safety on the slopesFor the safe negotiation of slopes and inclines, the new crane is fitted with Gradient Travel Aid. The control system automatically calculates the centre of gravity and warns the operator before the crane leaves the safe area. While travelling, the operator receives information about the permissible and actual gradient and the crane's overall centre of gravity at all times. If necessary, the boom angle can be altered so that the machine remains in the safe area.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

KG has bought a new Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1, which will expand the company’s mobile crane fleet. Steil decided to buy the full range of equipment, including both boom versions, a 54 metre and an 80 metre telescopic boom, and the complete luffing jib. The good experience the company has gathered over many years operating several Liebherr LTM 1500-8.1 cranes had a major bearing on the purchase decision. Other important factors behind the purchase of the new mobile crane included advanced developments and new features compared to the previous model.Find out more",Press releases,03/17/2022,"“We have operated several Liebherr LTM 1500-8.1 cranes for many years and have now invested in its successor”, says Birgit Steil, the owner of the company based in Trier. “It is another 8-axle crane which has the same compact measurements with the H-outriggers. The lifting capacity values on the luffing jib are enormous.” The LTM 1650-8.1 is the successor to what is currently the most successful of Liebherr’s large crane range, the LTM 1500-8.1. With a lifting capacity of 700 tonnes, it exceeds the capacity of its predecessor by 15 to 50 percent, depending on the equipment package.The LTM 1650-8.1 is designed to deliver maximum performance. The concept of the easily interchanged boom enables operators to choose between a 54 or 80 metre telescopic boom, which delivers fantastic flexibility. Telescopic section 3 with its pulley head is simply replaced with telescopic sections 3 to 5. The short boom reduces transport costs and erection time whilst the large boom is also available when required. The long boom configuration is ideal for jobs requiring a large radius. The two boom versions can also be fitted with a luffing jib. When it decided to buy the new LTM 1650-8.1, Steil decided on the full range of equipment with both boom lengths and the maximum luffing jib of 91 metres.Steil is mainly planning to use the new LTM 1650-8.1 for jobs in industry, port handling and for wind power. “The requirements in industry and wind power are constantly on the rise as are the required lifting capacities.

Liebherr and Tula join research activities ,Press releases |03/10/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-and-tula-join-research-activities.html?page=43,"At the International Engine Congress in Baden-Baden (Germany), Liebherr-Components AG and U.S.-based Tula Technology presented the results of their joint study on heavy machinery. Together, the companies carried out research on reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) produced by heavy-duty equipment. Based on simulations, Tula’s diesel Dynamic Skip Fire (dDSF™) software allows the reduction of NOX tailpipe emissions by 41% and carbon dioxide (CO2) by 9.5%. For this study, Liebherr Machines Bulle SA provided its D966 engine that operates in a variety of applications, like mobile or maritime cranes and wheel loaders.Find out more",Press releases,03/10/2022,"Integration of software into other Liebherr engines possibleThe results of the research could influence the development or manufacturing of off-road equipment worldwide in a positive way. Therefore, Liebherr-Components will continue its activities in designing a “proof of concept” hardware for the integration of Tula’s dDSF software into their engine system. The D966, a very compact 13.5 litres 6-cylinder diesel engine, will also be used in further tests. In the next step, Liebherr will consider the integration of the dDSF software into other engines in its portfolio.“Liebherr is a forward-thinking company focusing already today on the challenges that customers around the world will face tomorrow,” says Ulrich Weiss, Managing Director for Research and Development of Combustion Engines at Liebherr Machines Bulle SA. “The reduction of greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxide emissions is the goal that we strive to achieve, while continuously improving our engine’s performance.” The results of the joint study indicate that dDSF play an important role in addressing these challenges, being part of future solutions, which will help in reaching zero emissions.. Efficient engine operation and low level of tailpipe emissionsR. Scott Bailey, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Tula Technology explains: “At Tula, we are driven by a passion to increase efficiency in engines and motors of all types and also improve the environment. While there are existing regulations to reduce emissions in off-road machinery and vehicles, more stringent standards are expected within the decade. To comply, equipment manufacturers need solutions like our patented dDSF software to operate engines more efficiently and produce dramatically lower levels of tailpipe emissions.”Tula’s technologies provide cost-effective solutions that are proven to increase engine efficiency. In series production since 2018, Dynamic Skip Fire (DSF®) uses patented algorithms that choose to skip or fire individual cylinders dynamically to meet an engine’s torque demands. This enables near-peak engine efficiency for a cleaner burning, as well as more fuel-efficient vehicles. Noise and vibration are proactively mitigated by manipulating the firing pattern and cylinder loading. As a result, DSF has been deployed in more than 1.5 million passenger vehicles to date. The released study adds to the growing list of successful applications of Tula’s technology for diesel dDSF, including passenger cars, commercial vehicles and heavy machinery – with its main goal to reduce GHG and NOX as major contributors to global warming..

LiMain: Changing the way you think about maintenance,Press releases |03/09/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/limain-changing-the-way-you-think-about-maintenance.html?page=43,"Liebherr Intelligent Maintenance (LiMain) paves the way for an even higher crane availability at lower operational costs (OPEX) on offshore platforms. The fully digital, semiautomatic, and remote maintenance system offers more independency of time, place and resources for platform owners, resulting in never-before-seen savings.Find out more",Press releases,03/09/2022,"Accelerated by the global pandemic, there is a growing desire among platform operators for new approaches to regular maintenance. Previously, maintenance processes for offshore platform equipment were time-consuming, costly and required many resources. Additionally, platform owners face many obstacles that are difficult to manage, such as availability of personnel, weather conditions and need for professional expertise. To solve the tension between increased crane availability at lower OPEX in combination with a higher degree of independence from these conditions, Liebherr has launched a highly demanded product called LiMain. It is short for Liebherr Intelligent Maintenance, performing maintenance processes without having to operate the crane on site. The achievable savings are outstanding: LiMain offers up to 75% less mobilisation on unmanned platforms and up to 50 fewer service days on manned platforms per year. “We commit ourselves to shape the future of maintenance for our customers. LiMain will change the way they think about maintenance”, said Stefan Schneider, Global Application Manager for General Purpose Offshore Cranes, “the result of our commitment is an intelligent maintenance system, which solves challenges that platform operators have grappled with all around the world for years.”. Into the new age at customers’ paceA customer-orientated key element of LiMain is its modular system architecture, which consists of four different modules: “Automatic Greasing”, “Condition Monitoring”, “Predictive Maintenance” and “Remote Maintenance Cycle”. Whereas “Automatic Greasing” speaks for itself, meaning that core components of the crane are continuously checked and automatically lubricated, the other modules set a new standard on different levels of maintenance. With modern sensor technology as a part of the “Condition Monitoring” module, detailed data about the crane and its components are monitored in real time, which delivers an unprecedented level of transparency. With “Predictive Maintenance”, Liebherr raises the bar even further: it puts ad-hoc data into context, building on decades of experience from the construction of more than 1,000 offshore cranes and sharing this knowledge with the customers. “Remote Maintenance Cycle” represents the all-inclusive-approach, which combines all LiMain modules and enables semiautomatic maintenance as well as self-diagnosis of the crane.. “In addition to high-quality cranes made in Germany, Liebherr is well known for its comprehensive customer service, which we have taken to the next level with Liebherr Intelligent Maintenance”, said Gregor Levold, Sales Director Offshore, Ship and Port Cranes, “due to the modular architecture, our customers have the freedom to choose how automated their processes should be, meeting the specific needs of each client. In the near future, LiMain will also be available for further products in our Liebherr maritime crane portfolio.”.

Wind-assisted propulsion:Harness the wind with Liebherr,Press releases |03/09/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/wind-assisted-propulsion-harness-the-wind-with-liebherr.html?page=43,"Liebherr makes use of the wind as a resource for clean energy shipping, as well, and offers wind-assisted propulsion as an alternative solution. Slewing bearings and slewing drives excel at working together perfectly on high seas. The overall design of the wind-assisted propulsion consists of high, futuristic-looking sails that turn towards the wind and complement conventional ship propulsion still driven by diesel engines, for example. Hence, the technology harnesses the wind to propel a wide variety of vessels, such as bulk carriers, and thus ensures greater energy efficiency.Find out more",Press releases,03/09/2022,"Nussbaumen (Switzerland), March 9, 2022 - Almost 90 per cent of global trade is handled via commercial shipping. As of today, most giants of the sea still rely on heavy oil as fuel. Burning heavy oil does not only produce carbon dioxide, but also emits sulphur dioxide, which is harmful to the environment. To reduce the impact on global ecosystems, ships in certain areas are only allowed to have 0.1 per cent sulphur in their fuel or have to retrofit gas scrubbers to minimise sulphur dioxide emissions. However, this means that fuel or equipment is of higher quality and, therefore, more expensive. Hence, shipping companies face a major economic challenge – the reduction of environmental pollution and fuel consumption. One possible solution would be to use the power of the wind.The high seas offer plenty of wind. It is freely accessible and above all, it is environmentally friendly. Therefore, it would make sense to harness it for clean energy shipping. “Wind-assisted propulsion is the key word here,” explains Benjamin Schmid, Key Account Manager Maritime at Liebherr-Components AG. Liebherr offers a solution that includes two essential components: a slewing bearing and a slewing drive. Together, they prove their worth on high seas. The overall design of the wind-assisted propulsion consists of high, futuristic-looking sails that turn towards the wind and complement conventional ship propulsion, which is still driven by diesel engines. Hence, the technology harnesses the wind to propel a wide variety of vessels, such as bulk carriers, and, thus, ensures greater energy efficiency. “The sails convert wind power into direct propulsion. In this way, they can support conventional propulsion on the ship and reduce fuel costs by up to 30 per cent without losing speed,” explains Benjamin Schmid.. Time to get things movingIn the development of components, Liebherr draws on decades of experience in the production of offshore cranes, as well as on its expertise in the field of offshore wind turbines or blade bearings. The approach to the calculation of the forces on high seas can be derived from said technology. The size of the sail, the weight and the centre of gravity can all be used to make assumptions about the forces that occur. Thereon, Liebherr has created its own tool, in order to better grasp the green technology. It allows the ideal design of the slewing bearings, drives and swivel drives, which are responsible for the turning of the sails in the wind.. The power lies in the detailTo prevent salt water from penetrating the bearing and grease from leaking out, Liebherr pays close attention to the seal. Special sealing systems in the slewing bearings for offshore applications ensure safety during seawater operation. The double sealing system consists of two sealing lips: While the first protects against coarse dirt, the second prevents the intrusion of contaminants. The double seal, thus, prevents seawater from entering the raceway system to avoid major damage to the slewing bearing. In addition, the maritime CX coating according to DIN EN ISO 12944 ensures that the surface of the slewing bearing remains resistant to seawater.The slewing drive with lubrication pinion comes with an optional tooth safety geometry. This safety aspect ensures that the gear does not jam and protects the entire system – the slewing bearing and the slewing drive – from major damage.. In perfect harmony: the electric adjustment systemTo make the most of wind, the sails must be able to turn in the right direction. This is where the electric adjustment system from Liebherr provides an ideal solution. As a pre-assembled module, the components underneath the sail work together to align the sails. In the process, a higher-level control system gives the sails a specific value for rotation. The Liebherr electric adjustment system then implements this rotation, including a comparison of target/actual value comparison.“The electric adjustment system for the wind-assisted propulsion is a completely pre-assembled module. It consists of a slewing bearing, a slewing drive and an electric motor. Together with control and power electronics built into a control cabinet, it makes the sail turn,” Benjamin Schmid continues. An integrated position detection and monitoring system takes care of the constant comparison of the target/actual rotation. In addition, a lubrication system is built into the module. Controlled via the control cabinet, the system triggers appropriate lubrication intervals for the bearing raceway, the gearing and the pinions. The module comes as a plug-and-play solution. Since it is completely pre-assembled, the module allows an extremely quick deployment. The tedious assembly of the gearbox or the adjustment of the tooth-flank backlash, for example, is no longer the case.With this innovative solution for wind-assisted propulsion, Liebherr is also contributing to a more sustainable shipping and a lower-emission world..

Danish construction company M.J. Eriksson relies on Liebherr TA 230 Litronic dump truck ,Press releases |03/08/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/danish-construction-company-m-j-eriksson-relies-on-liebherr-ta-230-litronic-dump-truck.html?page=43,"Successful deployment of the TA 230 Litronic at one of the largest construction companies in Denmark: M.J. Eriksson A/S uses its new articulated dump truck from Liebherr for large infrastructure projects in Denmark and southern Sweden. There are two good reasons to celebrate: The articulated dump truck is the 300th Liebherr machine purchased by Eriksson over the years. And for over 40 years Liebherr, the construction company and the sales and service partner Johs. Møllers Maskiner A/S have maintained a close working relationship based on trust.Find out more",Press releases,03/08/2022,"M.J. Eriksson A/S is one of Denmark's largest construction companies and specialises in general civil engineering, special civil engineering and track construction work. The company has the most advanced and largest machine fleet in the country. Over half of the machines are from Liebherr. The TA 230 articulated dump truck has been proving its worth at Eriksson since 2021 and is used successfully in various road construction projects in Denmark and southern Sweden. It is responsible for the movement of materials in remediation work of existing infrastructures or the creation of new infrastructures.. Eriksson is impressed by the overall concept of the TA 230: The machine moves up to 28 tonnes of material per loading. A powerful drive train combined with the automatic traction control give the machine excellent driving performance and combined traction. This increases the operating efficiency and ensures higher handling capacity as well as greater cycle times on the construction sites. The company uses the TA 230 at different locations with a radius of up to 500 kilometres. Another advantage of the Liebherr dump truck is demonstrated here: Thanks to the optimal transport width of under three metres, it can be transported quickly and without a costly special permit. The machine also meets customer expectations in terms of comfort and design, which was another decisive factor in the decision-making process.. Machine impresses with excellent driving performance and traction""In Denmark and southern Sweden the soil conditions are often sandy and loamy"", says Jørgen Eriksson, Managing Director and owner of the company, describing the operating conditions on site. ""A major discipline for the TA 230. Even in the most difficult soil conditions and on inclines, the machine displays enormous traction, even when fully loaded. Better than all the other machines in our fleet"", he adds. This is down to the optimal combination of a powerful engine, efficient drive train and maximum traction. A 6-cylinder construction machinery engine with 12 litre capacity and 265 kW / 360 hp does its job under the bonnet. This ensures the excellent driving performance. At full speed the machine reaches top speeds of up to 57 km/h and 16 km/h in reverse. The efficient drive train comprises an automatic 8-speed powershift transmission and is responsible for the optimal power transmission. The 6 x 6 permanent all-wheel drive and the powershift longitudinal and transverse differential locks give the dump truck continuous traction. Due to the prevailing soil conditions Eriksson opted for wide base tyres which increase ground contact and ensure that the machine sinks less.. Comfort is a prerequisite for productive and fatigue-free workMartin Eriksson, Project Manager at M.J. Eriksson A/S, praises the machine’s high level of comfort: ""Liebherr managed to optimally integrate driver comfort and technical drive comfort. Our machine operators are impressed with the generously dimensioned cab with the modern space design as well as the drive comfort."" The cab is accessible in a safe and easy manner thanks to the offset steps and the large driver's door. Various storage areas, one of which is air-conditioned, as well as bottle holders, extend the available space. The clearly and intuitively arranged operating elements facilitate the work of the machine operators who are quickly ready for the shift. Shock absorbers on the front axle as well as the viscoelastic bearing at the cab optimally absorb the vibrations occurring during use. The soundproof cab also reduces the noise level in the cab to a mere 72 dB(A). This enables long, fatigue-free shifts. The machine has room and space for productive, comfortable work.. Innovative lighting and vision concept provides safety on siteLarge infrastructure projects often involve several individuals and construction machines with work carried out from morning till night. As such the safety requirements of the machines are high. Here Eriksson sees clear advantages in the lighting concept and visibility from the Liebherr dump truck. The driver's cab features excellent panoramic windows without any obstructing struts. A short, inclined bonnet gives the machine driver an optimal view of the driving, working and articulated joint area of the machine. A rear-view camera is integrated in the touch display, whereby the rear machine area is visible. LED dipped-beam headlamps with integrated main beam and extra strong LED headlamps on the front of the cab illuminate the route and work area. ""The innovative lighting concept creates optimal conditions for working in the dark. At the same time it ensures that the machine is always visible to all individuals on site"", concludes Martin Eriksson.The lighting concept is also part of the new machine design with edgy and dynamic styling. Jørgen Eriksson was impressed by the visual appearance of the TA 230 from the beginning: ""It is a true highlight in our fleet."". Company has long-term partnershipLiebherr, the sales and service partner Johs. Møllers Maskiner A/S and M.J. Eriksson A/S have been working as partners for many years. Uwe Kulik, General Manager Key Account at Liebherr-Export AG, looks back: ""For over 40 years Eriksson has placed its trust in our powerful and high-quality machines."" Leif Petersen, Managing Director of Johs. Møllers Maskiner A/S is delighted that Jørgen Eriksson describes the competent service of Johs. Møllers Maskiner A/S as ""the best in Denmark"": ""A compliment that makes us very proud.""M.J. Eriksson A/S is one of Denmark's largest construction companies and was set up in 1945. The range of services is comprehensive and includes general civil engineering and special civil engineering work and track construction. The family-run company is now managed in the second generation by Jørgen Eriksson and employs around 700 staff at eight different locations in Denmark and Sweden. Since 2015 the company has generated over 2 billion Danish kroner each year.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Electrifying: LR 1160.1 unplugged,Press releases |03/03/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/electrifying-lr-1160-1-unplugged.html?page=43,Unplugged stands for battery-powered at Liebherr. The crawler crane type LR 1160.1 unplugged is the latest model in the series. The crane has a load capacity of 160 t and electrifies the first customers with soft tones and an intelligent safety concept. Find out more,Press releases,03/03/2022,"The LR 1160.1 unplugged is one of the world’s first battery-operated crawler cranes. The electro-hydraulic drive has the same performance specifications as the conventional version. Both versions are operated in the same way, which is especially convenient for machine operators if they often have to switch between machines.One exceptional feature of the unplugged machines is Zero Emission. They do not produce any emissions and are extremely quiet. This strikes the right note especially in noise-sensitive regions, and finds favour with construction site personnel and residents.The loudest voice: silenceIn idling mode the sound pressure level of three unplugged cranes, at a distance of 16 m, is equivalent to that of a normal conversation on the jobsite at a distance of 1 m. This corresponds to a value of only 60 dB(A). If it is taken into account that a crawler crane is in idling mode for 60 % of the time on the jobsite, this low noise level is an advantage with great resonance.Unplug: that’s all you have to doThe LR 1160.1 unplugged can be operated with or without cable, therefore: unplugged. Capacity of the battery is designed for 8 hours lifting operation. The crane can be operated without restrictions while plugged into a conventional electric supply with 63 A, or charged within 4.5 hours. Using a 125 A supply, the battery can be fast-charged in only 2.5 hours.. Highest level of safetyThe designers of the crane laid great emphasis on the safety concept. Just like every crawler crane from Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH, the LR 1160.1 unplugged is equipped with all established assistant systems for safe operation.The latest feature of the LR 1160.1 unplugged is the Gradient Travel Aid for the safe negotiation of slopes and inclines. The crane’s control system automatically calculates the centre of gravity and warns the operator before the crane leaves the safe area. While travelling, the operator receives information about the permissible and actual gradient and the crane's overall centre of gravity at all times. If necessary, the boom angle can be altered so that the machine remains in the safe area.The Ground Pressure Visualization calculates the actual ground pressure of the machine in real time and compares it with the specified safety limits of the relevant jobsite. This means the operator is permanently aware of whether the machine is situated in, or is approaching, a critical area.When erecting or lowering the boom, the Boom Up-and-Down Assistant indicates the approach to the tipping border and automatically stops operation before the operator unintentionally enters an unsafe zone.First deployment: Great BritainLiebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH delivered the first three LR 1160.1 unplugged cranes to Great Britain. Select Plant Hire Company Ltd. is pursuing the goal of operating more and more zero-emission construction sites and has even planned three further LR 1160.1 unplugged cranes as investment for 2022.Select already put its trust in the LR 1250.1 unplugged, the world's first battery-powered crawler crane, at the time of its market launch. The company has always endeavoured to lead the industry with the latest technology in cranes. With the unplugged series, the potential of crawler cranes to function optimally as an electric version has become reality. This achieves the best possible combination of customer benefit, environmental compatibility and efficiency.The unplugged version of the crane can be recognized through the blue accent on the uppercarriage - the distinctive signature look..

Digital clearance monitoring for slewing bearings,Press releases |02/25/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/digital-clearance-monitoring-for-slewing-bearings.html?page=44,"With the condition monitoring system for slewing bearings, Liebherr has created a digital monitoring system. The integrated wear measurement system, bearing clearance monitoring (BCM), ensures optimum remote monitoring of the slewing bearings in various applications, such as mining, material handling or maritime equipment. The BCM system can be used to measure bearing wear in axial and radial directions, as well as tilting clearance. Such a remote diagnostics does not only ensure flexibility in measurement, but also reduced downtime, lower costs in maintenance and, above all, higher personal protection.Find out more",Press releases,02/25/2022,"More safety: No service personnel needed in the danger zone The focus of digital remote clearance maintenance lies on personnel safety. ""A distinct disadvantage of all common wear measurement methods is the necessity for service technicians to mount dial gauges or other measuring devices directly on the slewing bearing in the danger zone under the excavator or other machines,"" explains Wolfram Halder, product manager of the slewing bearings business unit. ""The Liebherr BCM system makes this unnecessary, as the measuring devices are already permanently installed on the bearing."" Another advantage is flexibility in terms of time. Currently, machine operators commission external service providers to measure the bearing clearance. This makes them dependent on the experience and schedule of third-party companies. ""With digital maintenance for slewing bearings by Liebherr, measurements can be carried out at any time outside the danger zone, independently of external service providers,"" explains Wolfram Halder.. Measurement within a few minutes: This is how the BCM by Liebherr worksHow does it work? The right technology and the right connection make it happen. The sensor connection box receives the data from the sensors attached to the slewing bearing and supplies the entire BCM system with power. The gateway stores the sensor data and updates for the BCM. This allows using the system autonomously even in regions without data connection. This is the case in mines, for example, as these often do not have the necessary mobile reception. A direct connection via Bluetooth makes the measurement process possible from a safe distance and without a network connection.

New alternative selected – Ley-Krane decides on rope pull technology option for its new LTC 1050-3.1,Press releases |02/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-alternative-selected-ley-krane-decides-on-rope-pull-technology-option-for-its-new-ltc-1050-3-1.html?page=44,"Ley-Krane GmbH & Co. KG has decided to buy a new LTC 1050-3.1 with rope pull technology for telescoping the boom. The crane contractor has already had good experience with this efficient crane, with the previous purchase featuring the TELEMATIK option. The fully equipped LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane can be manoeuvred in extremely restricted areas using RemoteDrive. A telescoping crane operator's cab delivers excellent visibility for the assembly process. Good customer care by Liebherr and efficient service make Ley a loyal Liebherr customer.Find out more",Press releases,02/21/2022,"Ley-Krane GmbH & Co. KG has taken delivery of a new LTC 1050-3.1 at the Liebherr plant in Ehingen. This time, the Gummersbach-based company decided on the rope pull option for telescoping the boom. Ley already had one of these efficient crane models with the TELEMATIK boom in its fleet and it has proven its worth over a period of years due to its high lifting capacity. As a result of its good experience with the LTC 1050-3.1, Ley decided to buy another of these cranes. The new 50 tonne compact crane will replace a crane in the 40 tonne class from another manufacturer.Alternative telescoping systemsThe Liebherr LTC 1050-3.1 was originally designed with a 36 metre telescopic boom with the TELEMATIK high speed telescoping system, which delivers high lifting capacity and large radii. Since 2020, Liebherr has been offering an alternative in the form of rope pull technology, which has been in widespread use on other crane models for decades and is valued highly by operators. Customers can now choose between the TELEMATIK and rope pull options for the compact 50 tonne model. The two alternatives have their own advantages depending on the type of job. The rope pull mechanism is ideal for crane contractors who wish to use this powerful compact crane inside buildings. The synchronous telescoping of multiple telescopic sections on the 31 metre boom using a 2-way pulley block makes it faster than using TELEMATIK. High telescoping lifting capacities can also be achieved by the boom with the rope pull mechanism.RemoteDrive for restricted conditionsWhen Ley decided to buy the new LTC 1050-3.1, the company also decided on the remote option for controlling the undercarriage. RemoteDrive enables the crane driver to position himself at any problem location and manoeuvre the crane safely even in extremely restricted conditions. The fine tuning between the remote control and manoeuvring the crane with millimetre precision enhances the safety of personnel, the crane and the surrounding area.VarioBase® and telescoping crane operator’s cab for greater safety The VarioBase® variable supporting base is another feature that enhances safety. “It takes the strain of the operator and enables hoists to be made which otherwise would not be possible in safety”, explains company owner Markus Ley. “The crane has a great engine and is very comfortable to drive. In our mountainous region, that gives the crane driver a real feeling of safety”, continues Ley. When fitted with the full range of equipment as purchased by Ley, the crane also has a crane operator's cab which can be telescoped up to an eye level of eight metres. This gives the crane operator excellent visibility during the set-up process and a good view of the job site combined with good ergonomy.Experience makes Ley a loyal Liebherr customerIn the medium-sized family-run company, “the boss buys the cranes that he would like to work with himself”, says Markus Ley.

The comissioning of the 70-tonne machine marks a successful milestone for the introduction of Liebherr’s ultra-class mining dozer to the Indonesian market.Find out more,News,02/18/2022,"“The introduction of the first PR 776 in Indonesia, as a strategic mining market, is a significant step for Liebherr’s Mining division. In only a few years after its launch and an already considerable fleet operating all over the globe, it was finally time for Indonesian miners to start experiencing the major advantages the PR 776 would bring to their operations”, stated Max Muench, General Manager of Liebherr Indonesia.. Within only two months, the 70-tonne dozer has achieved over 1.000 operating hours with outstanding productivity and physical availability. It has been proven that the PR 776 outperforms its peers in terms of tons per liter of fuel burned and overall costs per ton of material pushed. The constant power management of the hydraulic system ensures low fuel consumption and enables a reduction in the carbon footprint. Additionally, a Liebherr instructor was dispatched on site to train the mine’s dozer operators and enable them to better understand the operating procedures of the PR 776. The dozer operators greatly favoured the PR 776’s integrated ROPS/FOPS cab feature, which provides an all-round visibility and further enhances workplace safety.Thanks to this project, Liebherr Indonesia is now able to explore promising opportunities to further increase the sales of the PR 776 on the Indonesian market. Max Muench further mentioned, “We are confident that our ultra-class dozer has made and will continue to make its beneficial features clear to a wider audience. The second and third PR 776, which will be delivered to other Indonesian mining concessions shortly this year, are already a favourable indication to us”.The Liebherr PR 776 is the world’s largest hydrostatically driven mining dozer. The machine enables the customer to operate with class-leading efficiency and consistent performances. Thanks to the intelligent drivetrain and the powerful Liebherr diesel engine, operators benefit from high torque and efficiency in every situation and at all times."

Cause for celebration: Liebherr delivers 1000th mobile construction crane,Press releases |02/16/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/cause-for-celebration-liebherr-delivers-1000th-mobile-construction-crane.html?page=44,"Twice the reason to celebrate: Liebherr has delivered its 1000th mobile construction crane. The MK 140 Plus expands the fleet of Hanyš - Jeřábnické práce, s.r.o. the largest provider of crane services in the Czech Republic and is the first crane of its kind in the country. The crane features a number of smart design solutions such as the VarioJib concept (flexible use of trolley and luffing modes), radio remote control option and an elevating operator’s cab.Find out more",Press releases,02/16/2022,"“I’m confident that the crane will bring in more orders and make our work even more efficient,” so the words of company founder and owner Rostislav Hanyš at the ceremonial handover in Radonice (Prague East), where he took receipt of the new machine from Valdemar Matuška, Managing Director of Liebherr-Stavební stroje CZ, s.r.o.. Matuška was delighted with this special delivery, “I’m sure we’ll continue working together and that this won’t be the only machine for Hanyš.”Hanyš already has a Liebherr MK 110 in successful operation. The concept and potential of the MK series won the company over, which is why a new MK 140 is now also joining the fleet. The agile five-axle crane is the most powerful MK in the series. Thanks to its vertical tower, the MK can be positioned directly at the building and therefore requires very little space. Only one person is needed for transport, assembly and operation. Several construction sites can be covered by the crane in one day. Its ecological and future-oriented hybrid power concept enables all-electric operation.. Three-section telescopic tower of solid-wall construction Featuring a low-positioned driver’s cab, the MK 140 weighs 60 tonnes and has a transport length of 16 metres. The crane superstructure is the only one in the MK series with a three-section telescopic tower of solid-wall construction. The VarioJib concept offers two operating options, enabling the flexible use of trolley and luffing modes. The time-tested trolley mode offers a high handling capacity for trolley operation. In luffing mode, the MK 140 moves the load through continuous jib adjustment, achieving a reach of 65 metres and a hook height of up to 94.4 metres. Additional lattice jib heads can be ordered separately, together with the ballast weight required, for even greater versatility in application.“MK series cranes are often called upon when short-term lifting work is required and conventional mobile cranes aren’t an option because of the space they need to handle projecting edges of angular buildings,” explains Jan Hloušek, Head of Tower Cranes Customer Service at Liebherr-Stavební stroje CZ. “The crane is perfect for jobs in urban areas and work on tall structures, such as steel framed warehouses.” The Liebherr MK 140’s excellent manoeuvrability is also supported by its chassis; all five axles are controllable by a total of five steering programs. Differential locks ensure excellent off-road mobility, even in difficult conditions.. Short jobs possible with minimal space requirements Rostislav Hanyš appreciates these advantages, “When it comes to working at heights, this crane takes up much less space than any conventional type. If we’re in a city centre, we only have to have enough space for the crane’s extended outriggers and we can reach heights of up 56 metres over buildings. It’s one of the great things about working with this crane.” Hanyš plans to primarily use the new MK for roof and air-conditioning installations and for setting up pools on roof terraces.Smooth handling and a comfortable cabin – that’s the appeal for Pavel Dobrý, one of Hanyš’ crane operators, “The MK 140’s sensitive drives and intelligent assistance systems make operation safe and precise.” Pavel Dobrý has already tested the new crane during a training course at Liebherr's production site in Biberach an der Riß (Germany), “It’s operated by winches instead of hydraulics – a reliable solution in my opinion.”. One-week training course for operatorsLiebherr supplied Hanyš’ MK 140 with all possible features, including an extra hook camera, an optional system for unique load increase (which is where the “Plus” in the crane’s name comes from), an extended jib, four ballast weights weighing 9 tonnes in total, and differential locks between both front and back axles. The elevating crane operator cab also got the full treatment with air conditioning, a drinks cooler, a heated seat and a high-resolution colour display screen. A one-week training course for crane operators at Liebherr’s production facilities was also included in the package.Hanyš - Jeřábnické práce, s.r.o. is a privately owned Czech company based in Radonice (Prague East) that has been engaged in crane services for over 30 years. The company currently has over 90 Liebherr cranes and offers crane work, heavy-duty transport as well as operational and transport-related services..

A first in Brazil – Guindastes Tatuapé takes delivery of Liebherr LTM 1120-4.1 mobile crane,Press releases |02/09/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/a-first-in-brazil-guindastes-tatuape-takes-delivery-of-liebherr-ltm-1120-4-1-mobile-crane.html?page=44,"The LTM 1120-4.1, unveiled at the CONEXPO-CON/AGG 2020 in Las Vegas (USA), is the most powerful four-axle mobile crane on the market. Its 66-metre telescopic boom is the longest ever realised in this crane class. In December, the first unit of the Liebherr 120-tonne crane arrived in Brazil and was taken over by the crane and heavy transport company Guindastes Tatuapé.Find out more",Press releases,02/09/2022,"The LTM 1120-4.1 embodies great performance and the very latest crane technology. Its 66 metre telescopic boom means that it encroaches into the class of 5-axle mobile cranes. Its lattice jib enables it to reach a maximum hoist height of 91 metres. This was an important factor in the purchase decision for Guindastes Tatuapé. Denys Garzon Rodrigues, Commercial Director at Guindastes Tatuapé, reasons: “The LTM 1120-4.1 is the new benchmark in the 4-axle class. It has the longest boom and delivers extremely high lifting capacities which increase its flexibility for jobs and improve transport costs as the crane can be used to complete jobs which would otherwise require a 5-axle crane, for which a great deal more logistical work is required.”Rodrigues also highlights the compact design and manoeuvrability of the Liebherr 4-axle crane: “As all four axles can be steered, it is ideal for use on very restricted sites. The VarioBase® variable supporting base and VarioBallast® adjustable ballast radius are features that make jobs in extreme conditions safer and more flexible.” To extend its range of cranes even further, Tatuapé actually placed an order for two LTM 1120-4.1 machines. The second one is due to arrive in Brazil in mid-2022.Guindastes Tatuapé has been active in the Brazilian market for more than 60 years, providing crane rental and special haulage services. From the very beginning, the company showed its preference for innovative technologies and has kept its fleet up to date by repeatedly purchasing new crane models.

Historic tower crane returns to Liebherr,Press releases |02/02/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/historic-tower-crane-returns-to-liebherr.html?page=45,"After more than 50 years, an old classic has returned to Liebherr: the Form 30A/35 tower crane. It was discovered and restored to its original condition by a Liebherr fan.Find out more",Press releases,02/02/2022,"The Liebherr Tower Crane Center in Bad Waldsee boasts a new attraction: a Form 30A/35 tower crane, built in 1969. The crane’s owner, Stephan Keim, loaned it to Liebherr at the beginning of January. The Liebherr fan had discovered the crane in 2008 and saved it from being scrapped. He worked for years to return it to its original functional state.. A 350-kilometre trip back homeBefore the crane could be assembled at Liebherr, it was disassembled and transported from Aschaffenburg to Bad Waldsee on two lorries, a 350-kilometre journey. On site, Stephan Keim and a team of Liebherr mechanics reassembled the crane within two days. Visitors can now admire the crane as an industrial monument at the Tower Crane Center site. “We’re excited that this part of Liebherr history has returned to us. Over the years, many historical construction machines have been taken out of service and scrapped. It’s important to us to preserve our history and Stephan Keim has made an important contribution to that,” says Michael Goll, Head of Global Communication & Organizational Development at Liebherr-Werk Biberach GmbH.. Restoring a legendIt took over four years to breathe new life into the Form 30A/35 – from its discovery to the finishing touches. The restoration alone took about a year to complete: “The crane was dilapidated when I acquired it,” says Stephan Keim. The account manager hadn’t restored a machine of that size until then. The crane, constructed in July 1969, was completely rusty and many of its components were badly damaged or broken. “Changing the screws of the ring gear alone took a whole day. They are very difficult to reach.“ The bolts, too, were rusty and beyond use, however, they were of good substance. They were polished, galvanised and reused wherever it was possible. The whole crane was sandblasted and repainted. Stephan Keim changed every single screw. Furthermore, the rope pulley bearing and restored the control cabinet as well as the ropes and wiring.. A new start with original and spare parts Overall, the tinkerer was able to buy and include numerous original and spare parts that Liebherr still has in stock. Liebherr also provided 120 litres of the original yellow varnish. “But the driver’s cabin posed a big challenge. It had rusted completely, and the metal sheets were full of holes. It was beyond repair,“ says Stephan Keim. Supported by his locksmith, he replicated the metal sheets, accurate to the millimetre, so that they were indistinguishable from the original. Today, the crane has a UVV (accident prevention regulation) test badge and is once again fully operational.. Indispensable from construction sites of the 70sThe Liebherr Form 30A/35 was produced from 1962 until the mid-seventies. It was one of the most widely built medium-sized cranes of its time. Liebherr constructed around 3,000 models. Erecting cranes with needle jibs were the common models at the time. Unit, in the mid-seventies, a new, fully modified type of cranes entered the market. They were easier to transport and more cost-efficient than the models that were common at the time. Although it gradually vanished from construction sites, the Form 30A/35 marked the beginning of a new era in crane construction: it was the first of its kind constructed with tubular and hollow profiles instead of the previously used L-profiles. In a modernized form, this construction method is still being used in all Liebherr tower cranes today.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Optimised for transport and assemblyThe focus during development wasn’t only on performance but also on assembly and transport. As a result, the jib and counter-jib can be attached to the slewing platform easily, conveniently and safely. Liebherr’s proven quick assembly connections make it all possible. Only five trucks are needed to transport the slewing part with jib, including counter-ballast, to the construction site. This saves time and money, and also helps reduce emissions.The 470 EC-B features a connection for both 24 HC 420 and 24 HC 630 tower systems. The 24 HC tower system is a perfect match for large cranes with high lifting capacities. Its compact dimensions allow individual elements to be moved cost-efficiently from A to B.The 470 EC-B has been optimised for the 24 HC 420 tower system; together they are the most cost-effective combination for freestanding hook heights of up to 67.8 metres. The maximum freestanding hook height of up to 96 metres is achieved with the 24 HC 630 system.. Excellent overview of site and parameters for the crane operatorThe top-slewing crane is available with one of three versions of the sophisticated LiCAB crane operator’s cab: LiCAB Basic, LiCAB Air or LiCAB AirPlus. All three offer a floor space of more than two square metres, an unrestricted view for precision lifting and an ergonomic control stand. These and other comfort features enable the crane operator to stay fully focused on the job at hand. Thanks to the cab’s extensive field of vision, the crane operator has a clear view of the site and the load to be lifted, which contributes to the safety of both operator and machine.Also included in the cab is the newly developed twelve-inch display screen with intuitive operability. The Tower Crane Operating System (TC-OS) provides crane operators and assembly engineers with specific menus, an extensive choice of languages and user-friendly units of measurement. The intention is that every user should be able to find the parameters relevant to their work without difficulty. Users navigate their way through the streamlined menu structure via touchscreen. To maintain an overview during crane operation or scaling, display masks can be combined in various ways. The exceptional usability of the TC-OS means that training and familiarisation times are reduced.. LED advertising space lighting for a powerful promotional impactLED advertising panel lighting can be configured to ensure a substantial long-distance effect and visibility, particularly at the onset of twilight and at night. With a total area of 8.6 square metres, the robust lighting is capable of delivering a powerful and effective promotional impact. The panels don’t have to be mounted separately during assembly and can remain in place on the counter-jib end section during transport. Signage is easily applied.Flat-Top cranes equipped for a variety of applicationsAs they don’t have a tower head structure, several EC-B series Flat-Top cranes are able to work together safely on the same site, even in tight conditions. Transport, assembly, handling capacity and safety: EC-B cranes are specifically designed to meet the requirements of modern construction sites. They cover a wide performance spectrum, ranging from small city to large handling cranes. The new 470 EC-B completes the top end of Liebherr’s successful series, with the crane reflecting the construction industry’s trend towards ever heavier components..

In Spain's largest wind farm: Transbiaga with three Liebherr LG 1750s in operation,Press releases |01/28/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/in-spains-largest-wind-farm-transbiaga-with-three-liebherr-lg-1750s-in-operation.html?page=45,"Working in Spain's largest wind farm: the crane and heavy transport company Transbiaga is working with three new Liebherr LG 1750 lattice boom mobile cranes in the wind farm Gecama. There, 67 wind turbines with a hub height of 120 metres are being erected to feed energy from renewable sources into the national power grid.Find out more",Press releases,01/28/2022,"Four Liebherr LG 1750 lattice boom mobile cranes, 67 wind turbines and 120 metre hub height: full operation for the heavyweights at the Gecama wind farm in the Spanish province of Cuenca. The components of the concrete towers weigh up to 255 tonnes. The nacelle, including the generator, weighs 140 tonnes. The rotor blades weigh 21 tonnes and are 74 metres long. ""In addition to our three new LG 1750s, there is also an LG 1750 from Grúas Ibarrondo, our partner in this wind project,"" says Jon Usabiaga, CEO of Transbiaga. The turbines were manufactured by the Nordex Group, one of the world's largest manufacturers of wind turbines, based in Hamburg and Rostock.Transbiaga is very familiar with the use of the Liebherr LG 1750 lattice boom mobile crane, as the company already has five other units in its fleet. ""In addition to its good operability, we also chose this crane model because of its high load capacity and mobility, factors that meet the needs and requirements of a wind farm. We bought the new equipment with the even stronger SX boom system. This means we are also well positioned for the future generation of wind turbines,"" reports Jon Usabiaga. ""The cranes are configured with 165-metre main boom and F-jib.""The three new Liebherr LG 1750s complement Transbiaga's machinery perfectly, ""as we use them as main cranes for wind farm assembly. They are indispensable to carry out this type of project in the most efficient way and with the highest possible quality,"" Usabiaga points out. ""They are particularly well suited to work in wind farms, as they can travel independently on the paths between each turbine. They have a smaller width than a crawler crane."" Transbiaga focuses its work mainly on the assembly of wind farms in Europe and Latin America. To be able to carry out this type of project, the company also has eight units of the Liebherr LR 1600/2W narrow track crawler crane, which is also predestined for driving on narrow tracks in wind farms.. Largest wind farm in SpainThe Gecama wind farm, owned by Enlight Renewable Energy, is the largest wind farm in Spain built in a single phase. Located in the province of Cuenca, it will cover an area of 41 km2 and have almost 80 km of road network. Gecama will have an installed capacity of more than 300 megawatts, generate around 1,000 gigawatt hours per year and save 160,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.For Transbiaga, the work on the installation of the Gecama wind farm is very important. Usabiaga reports: ""We are proud that such renowned customers as Nordex trust us to carry out this type of wind project. This means that we are among the benchmarks in the industry worldwide, both in terms of the capacity of our fleet and our work teams, and in terms of maintaining high safety and quality standards."" The construction of this wind farm is part of a series of projects that Transbiaga has been carrying out in Spain for years for Nordex, one of its largest customers. Other active projects are in Sweden, Chile, Brazil, Mexico and Puerto Rico. Expansion to other countries is planned for later this year.Transbiaga has a fleet of 49 cranes. 43 mobile and crawler cranes with telescopic and lattice booms are from Liebherr, testifying to the trust Transbiaga has in the quality and performance of Liebherr products and customer service..

Only through our cooperative and partnership-based collaboration can we meet the needs of our customers,"" says Andreas Müller, Sales Director for Liebherr Mobile Harbour Cranes.The year of the portal craneAnother record was set in the area of portal cranes. Liebherr has never before sold so many harbour cranes with a portal substructure. More than 20 new units were Liebherr Portal Slewing Cranes (LPS). Liebherr was able to close the year with a major portal crane project at the end of 2021. The leading steel manufacturer in Italy, Acciaierie d'Italia, ordered four new LPS 800 portal cranes. The four machines are 100 % electrically powered and allow for emission-free bulk handling. They are also equipped with Liebherr's Pactronic hybrid system, which supplies the crane with additional power when required.. Trend towards emission-free terminalsAlmost half of all mobile harbour cranes sold in 2021 were equipped with an electric main drive and thus equipped for emission-free cargo handling. The demand for various electric drive solutions has doubled when compared to the sales year 2019. ""The Liebherr MCC-tec GmbH has stood for sustainability in drives for decades. We see that our sophisticated electric motors are revolutionising port handling. Together with our customers, we will continue on the path to sustainable ports. Our innovative cranes and the development of CO2-neutral drive technology is inspiring the industry. Competition is trying to catch up, but Liebherr-MCC-tec have been leading the field in terms of development and innovation for many years,"" comments Andreas Ritschel, Deputy Sales Manager for Liebherr Mobile Harbour Cranes.All-electric LPS 420 E 2021 was also the year of the all-electric LPS 420 E portal crane. There is a clear trend within the maritime crane industry towards more electric main drives visible. In addition, the advanced LPS 420 E, which is powered exclusively by electric motors, also had a record year. Although sales have been consistently stable since its launch, a total of six portal cranes were sold in 2021 - one of them to Germany. Euroports Germany, based in Rostock, will commission the first all-electric LPS 420 E in the European market next year. ""We want to further strengthen the handling performance at our bulk terminal. In the coming year, we are not only investing in a new crane to be even more efficient, but we also want to make our contribution to sustainability,"" says Karsten Lentz Managing, Director of the Euroports Germany Group.. Growth market AfricaAfrica has been experiencing an economic upswing for several years now, accompanied by extensive investments in infrastructure. The continent is expected to have enormous economic potential in the future. This development has been reflected in African ports for years and is also visible in 2021, especially for container handling LHMs. Liebherr has delivered two new LHM 800s in the high-rise variant to the Sogester Container Terminal in Angola. Shortly before the end of the year, two more LHM 800s were shipped to Togo. The customer TIL Terminals will use the two giants for container handling in the port of Lomé.Growing responsibilityA strengthened market position also results in growing responsibility towards customers and partners worldwide. Liebherr MCC-tec is aware of the trust placed in it with regard to quality, reliability, and availability. ""We can only live up to this responsibility through joint efforts. We achieve this by continuously optimising our service network, our technologies, and our standards,"" says Martin Mathis, General Manager Customer Service Liebherr maritime cranes.Sustainability in action In addition to the various electric solutions, Liebherr also offers the possibility of operating diesel-powered equipment in a more environmentally friendly way. In the first half of the year, the first LHM 420 powered by HVO diesel was delivered to the Swedish port city of Södertälje. HVO Renewable Diesel is a fossil-free premium diesel product made from 100 % renewable raw materials that emits no additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A further step towards sustainability was achieved in September of 2021 when Liebherr-MCCtec was awarded the EcoVadis Gold Medal. EcoVadis is the world's most renowned provider of sustainability ratings with over 85,000 companies assessed. The gold medal places Liebherr-MCCtec among the top 5 % of all rated companies and the top 3 % of manufacturing companies.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

New customer – Levantek adds Liebherr LTM 1160-5.2 mobile crane to its fleet,Press releases |01/27/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-customer-levantek-adds-liebherr-ltm-1160-5-2-mobile-crane-to-its-fleet.html?page=46,Mexican crane contractor Levantek has taken delivery of its first Liebherr crane. The LTM 1160 5.2 all-terrain crane is now the company’s most powerful mobile crane. Rising demand from customers for greater hoisting capacities was the main factor behind the investment in the 180 tonne crane. The good reputation of the Liebherr brand and a visit by company owner Ferdinando Paez Trevino to the mobile crane production plant in Ehingen were the final steps in the decision-making process before the order was placed for the LTM 1160-5.2.Find out more,Press releases,01/27/2022,"Ferdinando Paez Trevino's Olympic Group consists of three companies – metal construction, transport and the Levantek crane rental firm. Its purchase of the LTM 1160-5.2 sees Paez Trevino significantly strengthen its crane division, as to date its fleet consisted of truck cranes with a much lower lifting capacity. He explains: “Our investment in a 5-axle mobile crane was an important strategic decision for us. We also considered purchasing a used crane. Ultimately we decided on a new LTM 1160-5.2 because it meets the requirements of our customers in terms of performance and boom length very well.”The LTM 1160-5.2 features a 62 metre telescopic boom. With its 10.8 m to 19 m long folding jib and additional telescopic boom extensions, it can achieve hoisting heights of up to 99 metres and radii of up to 78 metres. The great range and performance of the LTM 1160-5.2 were major criteria behind the decision by Paez Travino to buy it.Apart from the technical performance data of the crane, a visit to the mobile crane manufacturing plant at Liebherr in Ehingen was the deciding factor. Christian Tableros, Manager of the Mobile Cranes Division at Liebherr México, says: “Ferdinando Paez Trevino was very interested in finding out how Liebherr builds mobile cranes. That is why we invited him to visit the plant in Ehingen.” Paez Trevino continues: “I was very impressed with the quality in the production at Liebherr. I have had good experience with “Made in Germany” products as many of my fleet of around 200 trucks come from Germany. That also made the decision in favour of Liebherr an easy one.”.

New NC-B 12-70 demonstrates its strength in Saudi Arabia,Press releases |01/25/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-nc-b-12-70-demonstrates-its-strength-in-saudi-arabia.html?page=46,"The most powerful Flat-Top crane of Liebherr’s NC-B series is currently on its first job in Medina (Saudi Arabia), where it is part of a museum construction project. This twelve-tonne model is Liebherr’s latest addition to its NC-B series, which is designed for price-sensitive markets and customers. Thanks to its long reach, the NC-B 12-70 is suitable for both cast-in-place concrete construction as well as for the precise lifting of heavy prefabricated parts. It is available for order now.Find out more",Press releases,01/25/2022,"Just one look from above is enough to see the biggest challenge presented by the construction site in Medina: there’s not a lot of space. High-traffic roads and tall neighbouring buildings required crane operations to be planned with precision, something which Liebherr Tower Crane Solutions closely supported.With its maximum jib length of 70 metres and a lifting capacity of up to 12 tonnes, the NC-B 12-70 is reliable, economic and safe in its work. In addition, the tower crane also offers a jib head load capacity of 2,000 kilograms at maximum jib. These technical features make the crane an optimal solution for high-performance lifts in densely built-up metropolitan areas.It was Liebherr’s professional approach and fast execution of measures that impressed customer “MOBCO for Construction and Civil Works”, whose latest building project, the “Safiyyah Museum and Park” is underway in the centre of Medina. A museum, shops, cafés and a public garden complete with palm trees will move in following completion.. Optimised for transport and assemblyThe NC-B concept is optimised for transport and assembly. Five trucks deliver all elements of the slewing part with 70 m jib length to site quickly and easily. Standard-sized containers can be used for transport. Once on site, assembly is straightforward. The central unit with slewing platform and connection element only requires one lift. A weight reduction of the central unit is also possible: If needed, the slewing platform, control cabinet and cabin can be installed separately to meet the assembly crane’s performance capacity.Established technologies from Liebherr’s existing Flat-Top series further accelerate assembly. The LiConnect quick connection system enables the jib to be assembled quickly and safely in five-metre sections.. 16 EC 240 and 21 HC 290 tower systems: the perfect matchBoth 16 EC 240 and 21 HC 290 tower systems are compatible with the NC-B 12-70, whereby the 16 EC tower system, measuring 1.6 x 1.6 metres, has been specifically designed for use with the NC-B series. Pin connections ensure the 16 EC 240 system’s straightforward, economical assembly. The tower sections have a standard length of 3.9 metres, which enables climbing on the building. Longer tower sections of 11.7 metres can also be used for efficiently achieving a freestanding hook height of up to 50 metres. Using the 21 HC 290 tower system, the freestanding hook height can be increased up to 76.9 metres.The hydraulic climbing unit is designed with flexibility in mind; it’s suitable for both internal and external climbing, completely detachable and compatible with other Liebherr tower cranes. As a result, the operator only needs one device, which can be used on various construction sites.. Assistance systems and accessories increase operational comfort and safetyThe hoist gear, slewing gear and trolley are controlled by a frequency converter. This makes stepless acceleration during lifting, lowering and slewing effortless and enables high-precision crane operation. Drive units with frequency converter not only provide excellent handling characteristics, they also minimise the risk of damage to the crane, and flatten occurring power spikes.The Micromove smart assistance system, which ensures exact positioning of heavy loads, is included in the package as standard. Additional options include the ABB operating range limiting system and the EMS electronic monitoring system with sensors included. Assistance systems provide reliable support for crane operators during lifts and contribute to site safety. An optional slip ring unit also supports safe operation. This allows infinite slewing of the crane on site without the risk of cable breaks.Liebherr also offers a six-tonne version as part of its NC-B series in the form of the NC-B 6-62. The series is specifically designed to meet the requirements of price-sensitive markets and customers. Short delivery times are available for both series without compromise on in-house technologies – thanks to the production site in Pune, India, Liebherr is able to manufacture cranes in the region for the region..

Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 installs bridge in area struck by disaster ,Press releases |01/24/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-ltm-1650-8-1-installs-bridge-in-area-struck-by-disaster.html?page=46,The Bielefeld branch of the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) has hoisted a 46 tonne temporary prefabricated bridge over the River Erft using an LTM 1650-8.1. It will replace the bridge that was destroyed and washed away by the severe flooding in summer 2021. It means that car drivers and pedestrians in the south-west of the district capital will once again be able to cross the River Erft. The temporary bridge has sufficient capacity to carry vehicles weighing up to 30 tonnes. It is an important signal for the local population to show that restoration work is progressing and is due to remain in place for around one year until the brand new Erft bridge is ready for installation.Find out more,Press releases,01/24/2022,"In the Euskirchen disaster zone, the severe flooding in 2021 resulted in the bridge over the River Erft being destroyed and washed away by the sheer volume of water. THW Bielefeld has provided a solution in the Euskirchen suburb of Roitzheim in the form of a prefabricated temporary bridge. The temporary bridge was built by the THW and then assembled on site using an LTM 1050-3.1. The bridge, weighing 46 tonnes and measuring 22 metres long and 7 metres wide was then hoisted over the River Erft by an LTM 1650-8.1. The THW had engaged Cologne crane and heavy haulage contractor Wasel GmbH to complete this work.. The crane was set up with 135 tonnes of ballast with a ballast radius of 8.4 metres. The radius for hoisting the bridge into position, which weighed 50 tonnes, including the hook and fastening equipment, was 27 metres. Positioned on a concrete foundation, the bridge contains 1260 screw connections, which gives it sufficient capacity to carry vehicles weighing up to 30 tonnes. It will therefore be an important feature for the local population, enabling them to cross the River Erft in the south-west of the district capital. Julian Schmidt, Technical Director at Wasel, takes up the story: “The restoration work in the affected areas is proceeding at full speed and we are delighted that we can provide some assistance in these situations. It’s also wonderful to see how many people are doing such good work every day to get a little bit of normality back to the affected areas as quickly as possible.”Mayor Sascha Reichelt describes the temporary bridge as a major signal for the people of Euskirchen. It is a symbol of reconstruction and shows that life goes on. The temporary bridge is currently scheduled to remain in place for around one year until the new bridge is ready. The new construction presents a challenge, however, as the gas, water and telecommunications lines were all carried in the old bridge and will also have to be rerouted. THW Bielefeld is one of just 16 local THW organisations which has a specialist “bridge building” group and was already in action in the Ahrweiler district, which was also badly affected by the flood. “This is a special moment for me. I have never done anything like this before,” says an impressed THW Team Leader, Burkhard Aehlich.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Fuel cell: technological partnership between GreenGT and Liebherr,News |01/21/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/fuel-cell-technological-partnership-between-greengt-and-liebherr-news.html?page=46,GreenGT and Liebherr-Aerospace have entered into a long-term partnership to develop high technological added value (HTAV) fuel-cell systems.Find out more,News,01/21/2022,"GreenGT, a pioneer in the design and development of high-power, high-power density electric-hydrogen solutions and Liebherr-Aerospace Toulouse have signed a protocol of agreement to develop and sell hydrogen fuel-cell systems integrating Liebherr’s turbocharger technology.This agreement has been reached just as GreenGT has designed and developed the first generation of a new fuel-cell system, the NGT, destined for high technological added value (HTAV) applications. This extremely compact system generating a net power output of 65 kW for a mass of 150 kg is equipped with an ETC 25 kW Liebherr electric turbocharger.The NGT is aimed at applications requiring a high level of performance. Two electric-hydrogen prototype trucks based on Russian manufacturer Kamaz platforms have been successfully equipped with the first NGTs: The 44-ton truck for Carrefour developed since 2016 in the context of the French Cathyopé program as well as another heavy vehicle, a 40 ton truck, developed since 2018 in the context of the Swiss GOH! Consortium for Migros.. The Liebherr turbocharger technology originally developed for aerospace applications is based on air bearings for a centrifugal turbocharger fed by a high-speed electric motor. The way the compressed air is injected into the fuel cell has been optimized to supply electric power from an electro-chemical reaction controlled by the system’s on-board electronics.According to GreenGT, the signing of the agreement couldn’t have come at a better moment just when the production of the company’s new NGTs aimed at niche markets is coming on stream in GreenGT’s new unit in Collombey-Muraz (Switzerland). The momentum of the next three years means that GreenGT’s annual output will be around several hundred units all equipped with Liebherr high-performance turbochargers.While Liebherr-Aerospace’s turbochargers for fuel cells have already proved their robustness and performance for passenger cars, the partnership with GreenGT is an important step in Liebherr’s diversification strategy into the world of utility vehicles as well as other sectors."
Reaching new heights – Liebherr unveils mobile crane with 90 metre telescopic boom – the new LTM 1300-6.3,Press releases |01/19/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/reaching-new-heights-%E2%80%93-liebherr-unveils-mobile-crane-with-90-metre-telescopic-boom-%E2%80%93-the-new-ltm-1300-6.3.html?page=46,"Unveiling the LTM 1300-6.3 also sees Liebherr set a new world record – never before has a mobile crane been able to carry a 90 metre telescopic boom with an axle load of just 12 tonnes. The new 300 tonne model will add to the portfolio of Liebherr 6-axle cranes. It is a versatile, economical fast-erecting crane with a peerless telescopic boom length. The latest Liebherr innovations are included to enable the LTM 1300-6.3 to deliver economical, safe, powerful crane operation – ECOmode, ECOdrive, VarioBase®Plus, VarioBallast®, Auto-Ballast, single-engine concept and wind speed load charts. The LTM 1300-6.2 will remain in the portfolio as the entry point model into the class of luffing jib cranes.Find out more",Press releases,01/19/2022,"Liebherr has extended its portfolio of all-terrain cranes with another 300-tonne model. With its 90 metre telescopic boom, the LTM 1300-6.3 sets new standards in the 6-axle class and goes well beyond what the current cranes on the market have to offer. It is designed to be used as a fast-erecting crane with a high capacity at great hoist heights with a raised boom. That makes it ideal for erecting tower cranes and antennae as well as for wind turbine maintenance work. The LTM 1300-6.2 with 78-metre telescopic boom, offered by Liebherr in parallel, is the economical entry into the luffing jib class and in this configuration already offers unrivalled load capacities for a 6-axle mobile crane.Liebherr has made it possible to drive the LTM 1300-6.3 with different axle loads and gross weights, to ensure that it can be driven economically all over the world. Components such as the telescopic boom and outriggers can be installed and removed quickly and easily to achieve axle loads of less than 12 tonnes. One particularly interesting feature in this respect is tele-separation, which enables individual telescopic sections to be removed particularly quickly. This makes it straightforward to set up the crane for the road with a gross weight of less than 60 tonnes and axle loads of under ten tonnes. Liebherr can also deliver a self-assembly solution which enables the telescopic sections to be removed without the need for an auxiliary crane. This is compatible with other models such as the LTM 1650-8.1 and the LTM 1450-8.1. The flexibility and economy of the crane is increased enormously as a result.. Record-breaking boomThe record length of 90 metres is achieved by the new LTM 1300-6.3 using an 8-section telescopic boom – the pivot section plus seven telescopic sections. That is one section more than similar cranes in this class. To ensure that the complete boom as well as all the outriggers plus the hook block can be carried on public roads with an axle load of 12 tonnes, Liebherr has optimised the entire steel construction of the crane for lightweight construction.Although the LTM 1300-6.3 is not designed for use as a luffing jib crane, it has a wide range of lattice jibs available – 11.5 to 20  metre double folding jib, two 7 metre lattice sections to extend the telescopic boom, a 39 metre powerful fixed jib and a 43 metre hydraulically adjustable fixed jib. That enables the new 300 tonne crane to reach hoist heights of up to 120 metres. Particularly economical – various lattice sections are also compatible with other models in the Liebherr portfolio.. Wide range of innovationsWind speed load charts – load charts available for various wind speeds are available for the LTM 1300-6.3. They deliver enhanced safety and longer operating times for crane work in windy conditions. Load charts for cranes are generally only valid for gust wind speeds of up to 9 m/s. To ensure that work can continue safely in even higher wind speeds, Liebherr has calculated the load charts for additional maximum wind speeds and programmed them in the crane control system. For the LTM 1300-6.3, for example, it is 11.2 m/s, or even 13.4 m/s when using lattice equipment. In pure telescope mode, the tables even allow for a speed of 15.6 m/s. If the wind speed measured on the crane’s boom during a job exceeds the set chart wind speed, the crane operator can simply switch to a load chart with a higher maximum wind speed which will often allow the job to be continued.VarioBase®Plus – the rear supports have a double-stage design and achieve a support width of 9.4 metres, 2 metres wider than the front supports. This increases the capacity over the rear supports even more. The single-stage front outriggers have a lower weight, which also benefits the boom length.ECOdrive – an eight-cylinder Liebherr diesel engine in the undercarriage which develops 455 kW / 619 bhp and torque of 3,068 Nm provides the LTM 1300-6.3 with all the power it needs. The power is transferred to the crane axles by the 12-speed ZF TraXon torque gearbox. A torque converter ensures perfect manoeuvring. The additional ECOdrive mode delivers enhanced drive properties which both save fuel and reduce noise.Single-engine concept with ECOmode – Liebherr has continued its single-engine strategy on the new LTM 1300-6.3 with a mechanical power unit for the superstructure. The weight reduction created by removing the superstructure engine has been used to deliver a longer boom and more ballast with an axle load of 12 tonnes. ECOmode in crane operation helps to reduce fuel consumption and noise emissions. The complete pump drive is disconnected automatically when the engine is idling and then reconnected by the intelligent controller in a matter of seconds when required.VarioBallast® – the new LTM 1300-6.3 can be operated with two different ballast radii: 4.94 m or 5.94 m. The ballast radius can be reduced quickly and easily by one metre using standard mechanically adjusted ballasting cylinders. This solution is one of the main benefits of the new 300-tonne model when used in constricted conditions. The large ballast radius achieves maximum capacity. In fact, with its VarioBallast feature, the new crane can be operated with 8 tonnes less ballast compared to the LTM 1300-6.2 without any significant reduction of its lifting capacity. That reduces both transport logistics and CO2 emissions.Auto-Ballast – a single touch of a button is all that is required to secure the ballast to the turntable. That takes the strain off the crane operator as the automatic ballasting process is simple, fast and convenient. In addition, safety is also enhanced, particularly for routine procedures.The maximum ballast on the LTM 1300-6.3 is 88 tonnes. The 10 tonne suspended ballast blocks on the right and left are compatible with the LTM 1230-5.1 and LTM 1250-5.1 crane models. That makes them another economical solution for operators with these cranes in their fleets. There is also the fact that the individual ballast slabs have been modified in terms of their weight and dimensions to make them suitable for economical transport and fast, easy set up on site. All the ballast can be placed on the crane with just five hoists. The basic ballast of 42 tonnes has a width of just 3 metres, which means that it fits within the overall width of the vehicle. This makes it significantly easier to move the fully set-up crane on constricted sites.New options – the optional central lubrication system for the king pin bearings on the chassis is a new feature. It delivers grease to 24 lube points on the 6-axle crane automatically. Another highlight is that a total of six LED rear lights are available to order, which illuminate the working area perfectly with bright light for manoeuvring on the site..

HVO as an alternative fuel at Liebherr,Press releases |01/19/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/hvo-as-an-alternative-fuel-at-liebherr.html?page=46,"Cleaner drive concepts for vehicles and machines are becoming more important than ever in order to reduce CO2 emissions. Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils (HVO) play an important role at Liebherr. HVO is an alternative fuel which can now be used in the majority of the Liebherr construction machines, cranes and mining equipment in pure form or in addition to fossil diesel.Find out more",Press releases,01/19/2022,"Biberach (Germany), 19 January 2022 – The wide product range of the Liebherr Group with the diverse applications presents Liebherr with the challenge of what drive concept can be used for what application. Maximum performance should be associated with the greatest possible environmental compatibility. Sustainable, synthetic fuels play an increasingly important role at Liebherr. They also include HVO, the first commercially available fuel with which combustion engines can be operated with a virtually neutral impact on the climate. Many machines of the Liebherr Group with Liebherr engines can now work all over the world largely on a climate-neutral basis.Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils – can now be used in the majority of the Liebherr machinesWhen working on new drive concepts Liebherr relies on HVO, among others, as an alternative fuel. Its manufacture is climate-neutral if electricity is solely generated from renewable energy sources. In addition, it generates fewer emissions during its use than a machine operated with fossil diesel fuel. This becomes clear in a comparison: During the life cycle of a product the greenhouse gas emissions can be lowered by up to 90% if the machine is fuelled with Neste MY Renewable Diesel (= HVO 100), from one of the key HVO suppliers of the Liebherr Group, instead of fossil diesel. This calculation for Neste MY Renewable Diesel is in accordance with the requirements of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II (2018/2001/EU). The particularly durable Liebherr machines, which are often used by customers for many years, do not have to be replaced or retrofitted. Instead, they can continue to work with HVO fuel immediately.. HVO in Liebherr productsThe Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH has been fuelling its mobile and crawler cranes solely with pure HVO fuel since the start of September 2021. The changeover from fossil diesel to HVO applies to the crane acceptance and test drives as well as to the first fuelling before delivery. Furthermore, almost the entire factory transport in Ehingen has also been changed over to HVO. The Liebherr factory in Ehingen can make a significant contribution to climate protection in the future: With the changeover to HVO 2.5 million litres of fossil fuel and up to 6,500 tonnes of greenhouse gas are saved each year.In Europe HVO is also experiencing a significant growth in demand in the area of maritime cargo handling, which is particularly noticeable in Great Britain and Scandinavian countries. All products of the Liebherr product segment Maritime Cranes can already be operated with HVO, a changeover from fossil fuel to HVO is planned for all factory applications as well as within the framework of the first fuelling and commissioning of the mobile harbour cranes for the start of 2022. Some of the initial key customers in the area of port equipment includes the port of Södertälje in Sweden, which operates a LHM 420 with HVO and thus pursues the objective of becoming a green port.. Also in the product segments Earthmoving and Material Handling Technology of the Liebherr Group HVO is used on the customer's request for emission-critical special applications. This happens particularly in areas with high environmental requirements, like for example in Scandinavia. The Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH in Kirchdorf a.d. Iller is the first factory of the segment to replace fossil fuel with HVO fuel from January 2022. In addition to the first fuelling of all new machines before delivery, in future this changeover will also apply to machine acceptances, demonstrations and validation applications in the factory. In addition, the factory transport is to be gradually converted to HVO fuel. All machines used in production such as forklift trucks will be gradually fuelled with HVO fuel in the future.Alternative drives play a particularly big role in the mining industry. Also here HVO can already be used in the majority of the Liebherr mining products. However, comprehensive use of HVO is not realistic in this industry due to high energy requirements and the limited availability of the fuel in the near future.. Alternative drive concepts at Liebherr: An approach that is open to different technologiesLiebherr pursues an approach that is open to a variety of different new technologies when working on drive concepts. The company focuses on the energy conversion technologies available now and in the foreseeable future (""engines"") and the suitable energy carriers (""fuels""). Some of the energy conversion technologies currently include electric motors, fuel cells, batteries, combustion engines or a combination in the form of a hybrid drive. The energy carriers include electrical energy, hydrogen, ammonia, e-fuels, methanol, biodiesel, fossil diesel - and HVO.The manufacture and use of HVO is largely climate-neutral if only renewable energy sources are used. HVO is obtained from cooking oil waste, grease and fat residues, waste fats and vegetable oil. Then it is converted into hydrocarbons by the process of catalytic hydrogenation, i.e. the addition of hydrogen on intense heating. This in turn is an energy carrier and thus a potential fuel. To what extent HVO will also establish itself on the market in the long term depends primarily on how the global production volume of the fuel and the associated availability develop. Despite the significantly increasing production, HVO is only available extensively in a few countries in Europe. One thing is certain for Liebherr: HVO is only an environmentally compatible and socially acceptable solution if palm oils are not used in production and no rainforests are felled for acquiring new cultivation areas. The Liebherr Group together with its HVO suppliers make sure of this.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Rising to meet global challenges: Liebherr launches three new wheel loaders,Press releases |01/13/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/rising-to-meet-global-challenges-liebherr-launches-three-new-wheel-loaders.html?page=47,"Since 2010, Liebherr has been offering a series of wheel loaders tailored to markets outside of Europe and North America. Now Liebherr is modernising the three largest wheel loaders in this series with the new L 550, L 566 and L 580 models. Increasing the tip load, bucket sizes and engine power are some of the most important innovations. The wheel loaders also feature a new electrohydraulic pilot control. This technology forms the basis for various intelligent features which increase safety and productivity during daily use.Find out more",Press releases,01/13/2022,"Liebherr has developed the three new models at the Bischofshofen plant, its long-standing Centre of Excellence for Wheel Loaders. Decades of experience in designing wheel loaders was one of the keys to success in the development process. “We also analysed our international customers’ demanding wheel loader operations over a long period. This included observing different mining operations around the world, some in Africa and South America, coal handling in India and timber work in Russia. Our customers’ experiences were crucial to the development of the new wheel loader series,” explains Wolfgang Rottensteiner, who is responsible for sales of the wheel loader series at Liebherr-Werk Bischofshofen GmbH.. Performance increases for the travel drive, lift arms and working hydraulicsThe new L 550, L 566 and L 580 wheel loaders feature the proven hydrostatic Liebherr travel drive, which is renowned for its great efficiency. Thanks to increases in engine power – approximately 17% for the L 550 – the travel drive is even more powerful while maintaining the same low fuel consumption. This is advantageous when accelerating or penetrating material and lowers fleet fuel costs. Liebherr has installed the diesel engine in the rear, where it also acts as a counterweight thereby increasing the tip load for the wheel loaders.Liebherr has three lift arm versions on offer for the new models. Firstly, the z-bar kinematics, which come to the fore particularly in the lower lifting range and for the break-out force. Secondly, the industrial kinematics, which have been designed for working with heavy working tools such as high dump buckets and log grapplers. Finally there are the High Lift lift arms – an extended version of the z-bar kinematics with the longest lift arms in this wheel loader segment. These ensure greater reach and more productive loading procedures at great heights, which is beneficial when loading railway wagons or lorries with high sides.The working hydraulics of the wheel loaders will also impress customers with their larger components and new electrohydraulic pilot control. This technology also ensures responsive movements of the lift arms, independent of the size or weight of the working tool. Liebherr also offers a new, optional weighing device on the bases of the electrohydraulic pilot control. The assistance system works automatically as a check scale and provides real time information about the loading procedure. This data helps machine operators to precisely fill dumpers, lorries and railway wagons with the specified quantities and to avoid overfilling.. Increased safety thanks to the electrohydraulic pilot control and highly-durable componentsThe electrohydraulic pilot control enables operators to perform individual adjustments on the new wheel loaders. For example, they can set lift limitations and maximum tilt-out heights, thus reducing the risk of accidents in areas where space is restricted. The tilt-out speed can also be programmed to protect lift arm components and the installed equipment.In addition to these optimisations for operating safety, Liebherr has also invested in the operational reliability of the new wheel loaders. Because they are faced with an abundance of challenges: Remote operating areas, extreme climates, demanding loading materials and multi-shift operation over a long period demand a high degree of reliability. For this reason, Liebherr has installed larger axles than were fitted on predecessor models. Liebherr has drawn on proven components from its other wheel loaders for the core components and steel construction. When maintenance and servicing are required, Liebherr supports its customers with a global sales and service network.. Modern wheel loader design ensures comfort and functionalityThe modern design of the new L 550, L 566 and L 580 wheel loaders has particular functional advantages in addition to the bold new look. The clean lines on the rear as well as the large glass surfaces in the cab facilitate good all-round visibility. Furthermore, the new reversing camera, which is installed in a protected position in the engine bonnet, assists the machine operator to keep an eye on the area to the rear. Numerous details that have been seamlessly integrated in the wheel loaders’ exterior design make service work easier. For example, on the L 566 and L 580, the engine bonnet opens to the rear, making the diesel engine freely and safely accessible.A sturdy cab access leads to the redesigned and spacious operator's cab. One of the special features of the cab is the height-adjustable 9-inch touch display with intuitive menu navigation. The high-resolution display provides a clear overview of all the wheel loader’s operating information. The Liebherr control lever enables the highly-sensitive control of work movements as part of the modern operating concept. Hydraulic working tools, such as the log grappler, can also be precisely controlled with the optional mini joystick on the control lever. The new electrohydraulic pilot control also makes an important contribution here. Large window surfaces and well-thought out storage areas complete the modern cab design..

Three Liebherr Auto RMGs enter service at CSX Intermodal in North Carolina,Press releases |01/12/2022,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/three-liebherr-auto-rmgs-enter-service-at-csx-intermodal-in-north-carolina.html?page=47,"Liebherr Container Cranes Ltd. are delighted to have handed over three fully automated rail mounted gantry cranes to the CSX Carolina Connector Intermodal Terminal (CCX) in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The cabinless RMGs have been supplied with Liebherr Remote operator Stations (ROS) for supervised moves and exception handling.Find out more",Press releases,01/12/2022,"Automated operationsThe widespan Liebherr RMGs have a span of 165 ft. (50.292 m), a lift height over rail of 50 ft. (15.24 m) and cantilevered outreaches both sides with a safe working load of 40 long tons (40.6 tonnes). Within the span, the machines will work five rail lines and a four-high, five-wide container stack, with a further two rail lines under one of the cantilevers. Truck handling will take place under the other cantilever in a dedicated truck transfer area. Container handling on the stack is fully automated and in line with terminal safety procedures, picking and placing from the rail cars is carried out remotely using supervised moves. Truck handling employs a combination of manual and supervised moves. The RMGs will operate on both domestic 53’ wide top pick containers and ISO containers, handling single and double stacked rail cars.TechnologyAn industrial data centre with redundant servers and a high speed fibre network anchor the automated crane operations and communications. A 3D measurement system scans the operational area, continuously creating and updating profiles of container stacks, railcars and hazards, providing key data for path planning and automatic operation. XYZ crane positioning is provided by Infrared spreader tracking, RFID gantry and trolley positioning technologies further supported by encoders.A proprietary obstacle generation and monitoring system is at the heart of the cranes’ automation. Built by a team of Liebherr engineers and based on decades of automation expertise by the Liebherr Group, the system has been tailored to precise customer requirements. It works seamlessly together with the Tideworks TOS through a customer-specific interface.For safety, a Yardeye system has been installed. This system monitors operational traffic, particularly pinmen vehicles in and around the RMG operational area allowing for safe operation. The system uses both GNSS and RFID, which provides for increased accuracy and redundancy, tracking the position, heading and velocity of equipped vehicles in the yard in real time.. Fast and precise operation reduces energy consumptionThe new cranes bring state-of-the-art, emission-free container handling to CCX. In line with Liebherr’s long established simultaneous motion approach to container handling, the automated RMG includes 3 dimensional stack and train profiling allowing optimal path planning and the most productive and efficient spreader path rather than the traditional approach of square moves. This approach increases productivity and throughput and also results in a further reduction of energy consumption. The Liebherr drive system with active front end and simultaneous motion allows power usage to be optimised on the crane and regenerated energy fed back to the grid.Liebherr’s eight-rope-reeving system is inherently stable and ensures precise and faster final positioning times whilst the micro-motion controls ensure smooth remote driver operation when placing containers onto trucks.The CCX terminal is ideally positioned with over 5 million customers within a 120 mile radius and has exceptional connectivity being located in close proximity to I-95 highway and the growing Raleigh metro area. The new machines bring state-of-the-art freight handling to North Carolina whilst the electric cranes have zero local emissions..

The new L 508 compact has become larger and wider than both of the other Liebherr compact loaders. Its powerful travel drive and high tipping load have received praise from customers.. Versatile and powerful: Intelligent solutions for the lift armsThe new compact loaders have robust lift arms with z-bar kinematics, which facilitates the use of a wide variety of attachments. Liebherr has optimised the parallel guidance for safe and precise operation when working with forks. This is critical, for instance, when transporting palettes with paving stones or decking tiles in garden and landscaping applications. To increase versatility even more, Liebherr offers High Lift lift arms for the L 506 and L 508 models on request. This is an extended version of the lift arms with a greater reach. This enables the compact loaders to also load taller transport vehicles.. Wheel loaders are confronted with a myriad of challenges when used in municipal services: Transporting materials with various buckets or forks, excavating with a 4 in 1 bucket, cleaning work with a sweeper, or winter services with a snow plough are just some examples of this. To ensure the mastery of this wide variety of applications, Liebherr offers its fully automatic quick coupler system LIKUFIX for the three compact loaders. LIKUFIX allows the machine operator to change between mechanical and hydraulic working tools from the cab within seconds at the touch of a button. This saves time and reduces the risk of accidents as the operator doesn't have to leave the cab when changing the equipment.. Comfortable and safe: New cab and functional designWell thought-out solutions can also be found in the redesigned cab, which can be entered via a sturdy, reinforced step. Of particular note, Liebherr has increased the amount of glass throughout the cab. The windscreen now even reaches into the foot area of the operator's cab. This ensures better visibility in all directions, particularly of the attachment and in the articulation area. The rear screen is curved on the sides, enabling an unobstructed view of the rear area. The new compact loaders can be equipped with a backup camera on request, for even more safety when reversing.Numerous details, such as the clearly-arranged control elements or the practical storage areas, increase comfort in the operator's cab. With the proven Liebherr control lever, the machine operator can operate the lift arms and the attachment safely. This also applies to the optional mini joystick on the control lever, which is used to control additional hydraulic functions. Optionally available is an infinitely-adjustable steering column; the display, standard on all machines, is also adjustable and located on the A pillar in the cab. These measures ensure simple and intuitive operation of the compact loader, which plays an important role, especially, for example, for rental construction machines.Liebherr’s new compact loaders feature a modern and functional design. The engine bonnet has a dynamic and clean design, with great visibility from the cab. The lift arms have a tapered design, which optimises the view of the attachment and the material. The compact design with a low centre of gravity ensures optimum weight distribution on the new compact loaders. The result is high stability and safe, comfortable operation, day in and day out..

Fleet addition: new Liebherr LR 1700-1.0 crawler crane for Eurogrúas 2000,Press releases |12/17/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/fleet-addition-new-liebherr-lr-1700-1-0-crawler-crane-for-eurogruas-2000.html?page=47,"Spanish crane and heavy lift company Eurogrúas 2000 has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LR 1700-1.0 crawler crane. The new 700-tonne crane replaces a 600-tonne crawler crane that the Spanish company mainly used in the wind power sector. Eurogruas 2000 chose the LR 1700-1.0 because ""the machine fits perfectly with the requirements of this market in terms of the weight and height of the current wind turbines"", says Javier Sato, partner of Eurogrúas 2000. The new investment goes hand in hand with the company's strategy of always keeping its machinery technically up-to-date.Find out more",Press releases,12/17/2021,"Eurogrúas 2000 was looking for a crane that could meet the increasing demands of assembling modern wind turbines. Javier Sato says: ""The LR 1700-1.0 is the ideal addition to our machine fleet. We have smaller narrow track cranes that are very well suited for certain types of wind power projects. As a larger model, we operate the Liebherr LR 1800-1.0 crawler crane. We needed a crane to fill the gap between 600- and 800-tonne cranes."" The most important criteria in Eurogrúas 2000's decision for the LR 1700-1.0 were the Liebherr crawler crane's lifting capacity and boom length, as well as its innovative technology and compact design.. From the manufacturing plant directly to the wind farmThe Liebherr LR 1700-1.0 from Eurogrúas 2000, the first in Spain of this new model, went directly from the mobile crane factory in Ehingen to different wind farms spread across Germany, the first of which was located near Düsseldorf. There, the crane was responsible for the assembly of 20 wind turbines with a hub height of 161 metres and unit weights of up to 86 tonnes. ""The fact that a company like Eurogrúas 2000 is awarded an international project of this kind, which involves working beyond the borders of its own country, is proof of the trust and recognition shown to us by a customer with whom we have had a business relationship for years and with whom we have already carried out other national and international projects. It is also confidence in the right choice of crane"", reports Sato.""When our client learned about the purchase of the Liebherr LR 1700-1.0 700-tonner, we jointly concluded that this was the right model for the job, as these are very specialised wind turbines that require certain performance specifications,"" Sato continues.. Eurogrúas 2000 relies on Liebherr as one of its flagship brandsLiebherr's LR 1700-1.0 combines the advantages of the economical transport of 600-tonne class crawler cranes with the performance of 750-tonne class lattice boom cranes and all the innovations of Liebherr's crawler crane developments in recent years. The successor model to the LR 1600/2 is based on its 600-tonne predecessor and has similar dimensions. The key to the higher performance of the new 700-tonne crane is the new base machine, which offers 10 to 15 percent more lifting capacity. In addition, the 3.5-metre wide H-lattice sections in the lower section of the main boom significantly improve the lateral stability of the entire system.The Eurogrúas Group has relied on Liebherr cranes for years, as they offer state-of-the-art technology and excellent performance data for both industrial and wind power applications. The speed, efficiency and quality of Liebherr Ibérica's after-sales service are also major strengths that have led Eurogrúas to make Liebherr one of its flagship brands. The Eurogrúas Group has a fleet of 130 cranes, of which 113 units are from Liebherr.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr-Aerospace Brasil receives new Embraer approvals,Press releases |12/15/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-aerospace-brasil-receives-new-embraer-approvals.html?page=48,"Liebherr-Aerospace Brasil entered on the approved suppliers list of Embraer to carry out the mechanical assembly and component blasting process. With the approvals, Liebherr-Aerospace Brasil increases its scope of supplying qualified services to Embraer and to other customers.Find out more",Press releases,12/15/2021,"Liebherr-Aerospace and Embraer already have a long partnership that lasts for decades. But that does not mean that the scope of services is closed: Liebherr-Aerospace Brasil is constantly updating its processes to be prepared to meet the new Embraer’s and aerospace market’s demands.Accordingly, Embraer included Liebherr in the approved suppliers list to carry out the components’ mechanical assembly process and also for sandblasting (Bright Shot Peening), enabling the supply of more complete products with machining, surface treatment and mechanical assembly. These new approved processes allow new possibilities also for other Embraer suppliers that can use Liebherr-Aerospace Brasil as a subcontractor, increasing the possibilities of Embraer’s local supply chain.“Two components were used for the approval process. But we are not limited to that, as the approval covers the process. So from now on, we can offer and produce parts with bushing assemblies and other mechanical assembly components”, explains Patricia Lima, Sales Supervisor at Liebherr-Aerospace Brasil.. The assembly process of this standard generally includes cryogenic assembly activities (using furnaces and liquid nitrogen), with hand press use, sealant application and bushing reaming, with tools specially made for this purpose.The sandblasting process, which is usually done by launching thousands of micro-particles on the piece, leaves it ready to receive painting and other finishes. In addition, it provides the product at certain points with characteristics that increase fatigue resistance.Liebherr-Aerospace Brasil has vast experience within the Liebherr Group in manufacturing and assembling components for the aviation industry. The company based in Guaratinguetá (near São Paulo) specializes in machining, surface treatment, assembling and supplying products not only to Embraer, but also to other international customers..

In the spotlight: Liebherr cranes help create impressive stage sets ,Press releases |12/15/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/in-the-spotlight-liebherr-cranes-help-create-impressive-stage-sets.html?page=48,"LED cubes instead of concrete blocks, Roman antiquity instead of modern apartments, culture instead of construction sites: Liebherr cranes help to build and dismantle sets, and are even sometimes part of the production, so that theatres across Europe are never left with an empty stage. From bottom- and top-slewing cranes to mobile construction cranes, various machine types have impressed with their intelligent assistance systems, long reach and high load capacity in Verona, Frankfurt and Bregenz this season.Find out more",Press releases,12/15/2021,"As soon as the stone steps in the ancient Roman amphitheatre are clear, the Liebherr 125 K starts to unfold itself. Its straightforward assembly, without the need for extra equipment, was one of the main reasons why the Italian Liebherr dealer Niederstätter opted for Liebherr’s largest fast-erecting crane for the Opera Festival held at the Arena Di Verona.Various productions were staged over the summer months, which meant that the imposing stage sets had to be changed several times. The 125 K was unfolded and disassembled quickly to meet the requirements of this unique job. The crane was positioned directly on the ancient walls atop a six-metre gantry; a solution that minimised the amount of space required. A Liebherr LTM 1160/2 mobile crane lifted the fast-erecting crane onto the gantry and transported it back down at the end of the festival season.The 125 K also made a big impression with its load capacity of 1,300 kilograms at maximum radius. Thanks to its reach of up to 55 metres, the bottom-slewing crane was able to cover the entire stage area and completed all necessary lifts with ease. Smart assistance systems, such as Micromove, supported the lifts, ensuring that the scenery was positioned safely and with precision. LED jib lighting also enabled trouble-free working at night.. Frankfurt: LED cube perfectly positionedPrecision handling was paramount when a Liebherr MK 110 was deployed at Germany’s largest temporary open-air theatre. It was at the Sommerbau theatre on the city border of Offenbach and Frankfurt where the five-axle mobile construction crane, belonging to the Eisele AG Crane & Engineering Group, provided support for the production of “Dionysus City”.The performance included several video inserts, which the event technology service provider Satis&Fy broadcast via a huge, 3.9-tonne LED cube. Even in windy conditions, the crane operator had to get the position exactly right so that technicians could take delivery of the cube both quickly and safely.“The MK 110 was perfect for this task. Only this type of crane is capable of such precision handling,” says Lars Ulrich, project manager at Satis&fy. The infinitely variable and emission-free high-performance FC drive ensured smooth slewing. Even heavy loads arrived safely on the ground with the help of intelligent assistance systems.Thanks to the MK series’ innovative design concept, it was possible to position the crane directly at the purpose-built open-air theatre and with an optimal view of the action. Both the tower jib concept and adjustable lift cabin were essential for ensuring high safety standards in the theatre. The ergonomically designed cabin also offered the crane operator a high level of comfort, which was important as each performance lasted up to ten hours.. Bregenz: A unique assembly challengeThe clown’s head from the production of Rigoletto hangs suspended over Lake Constance; the spectacular new stage set belonging to the lakeside theatre Seebühne Bregenz needs a strong partner for its construction and dismantling. Which is why, at the end of August, divers anchored a Liebherr 150 EC-B 8 Litronic Flat-Top crane on piles driven into the lake floor, to provide it with a foundation. The crane’s task is to remove the Rigoletto scenery and help build the set for Madame Butterfly, ready for the new season. A job that is expected to take around eight months.The crane stands 28 metres from the shore and an auxiliary crane with a 28-metre radius was involved in its assembly. Such a crane was sufficient for the task at hand as with Flat-Top cranes the hoisting height and lifting capacity of the assembly crane can be lower than with cranes with tower head. For Liebherr assembly engineer Thomas Wallner, it was quite an unusual assembly, “The biggest challenge was not being able to communicate with the divers the normal way.”The undercarriage was assembled on land with partial ballast as striking pins underwater wasn’t an option. Swell and poor visibility under water proved challenging for the assembly engineers, divers and mobile crane operator as they worked to accurately position the undercarriage on the pile substructure. But thanks to their patience and strong teamwork they succeeded.The 150 EC-B in use has an impressive maximum lifting capacity of eight tonnes. This allows the workshop responsible for the set to prefabricate as much of the scenery as possible; had a crane with a lower lifting capacity been chosen, there would have been significantly more individual parts. The tower crane can be seen against its picturesque backdrop until spring 2022. By then, the new set for Madame Butterfly should be in place, ready for the new festival season to begin..

100 percent Liebherr: Hess extends fleet with LTM 1150-5.3 ,Press releases |12/13/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/100-percent-liebherr-hess-extends-fleet-with-ltm-1150-5-3.html?page=48,"Düsseldorf-based company Hess GmbH has strengthened its crane fleet with a Liebherr LTM 1150-5.3 mobile crane. This specialist contractor for company relocations, machine installation and machine transport services has its own crane department. This is responsible both for the rental and for the use of the cranes for its own machine installation work. Hess relies 100 percent on Liebherr mobile cranes.Find out more",Press releases,12/13/2021,"Company proprietor Joachim Hess explains: “The LTM 1150-5.3 is a modern, powerful crane which we can use flexibly due to the fact that its road-going state can be varied. It is also compact and manoeuvrable – a major benefit for many of our jobs.” Oliver Kuldtzun, Manager of the Crane Department, continues: “We ordered the crane with the VarioBase® variable supporting base because it delivers additional safety, particularly on restricted sites. And it also gives us additional lifting capacity directly above the outriggers.”Flexible all-rounderHess is planning to use the new 150 tonne crane for heavy installation work and also for various everyday crane rental jobs, for example, in the construction and infrastructure sectors. All the mobile cranes in the Hess fleet were delivered by Liebherr. “We have had very good experience with Liebherr machines. They feature the very latest crane technology. We also like the fact that the crane controls are standard in small and large cranes alike. That enables us to use our operators flexibly on the machines,” Hess adds.Kuldtzun also mentions the fact that the renowned good service from Liebherr was a major factor behind the decision to buy the crane: “We receive excellent support from the Liebherr service outlet in Oberhausen, both for inspection and regular maintenance work as well as repairs.”The LTM 1150-5.3 has the longest telescopic boom in its crane class at 66 metres and is on a par with crane types in the 200-tonne capacity class. It delivers outstanding lifting capacities when fully raised and at large radii. And it is immediately ready for use once it reaches the site. This is because the new 150 tonne crane carries nine tonnes of a ballast with a gross weight of 60 tonnes. That means it can complete lots of jobs without requiring additional ballast transport vehicles. That saves time and money.Hess GmbH was founded in 1977 as an industrial installation contractor and now has a workforce of over 60. The fleet also contains special electrically powered mobile cranes and mini cranes. Today the company is one of the leading providers of a complete range of plant and machine relocation services..

Most powerful crane in the fleet – Wasel extends crawler crane portfolio with LR 11000 ,Press releases |12/09/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/most-powerful-crane-in-the-fleet-wasel-extends-crawler-crane-portfolio-with-lr-11000.html?page=48,Wasel GmbH has taken delivery of a Liebherr LR 11000 crawler crane to add to its growing fleet of lattice boom cranes. The 1000 tonne crane is the fifth and most powerful lattice boom crane operated by the Bergheim-based company. The LR 11000 passed its first test with flying colours at a wind farm in North Rhine-Westphalia.Find out more,Press releases,12/09/2021,"As recently as June this year, Wasel took delivery of an LR 1700 1.0, the latest crawler crane model from Liebherr. The LR 11000 provides even greater capacity. Matthias Wasel, who runs the business with his brother, Thomas, explains: “The lifting capacity requirements in industry and for public infrastructure projects are on the rise. The towers for wind turbines are also increasing in height all the time. That is why we decided to buy Liebherr’s 1000 tonne crane. It means that we are absolutely ready for the next generation of wind turbines.”. Thomas Wasel continues: “The LR 11000 is now the fifth large lattice boom crane in our fleet. All the cranes bear the Liebherr brand. We are impressed by Liebherr products, particularly its crawler cranes. The quality of both the products and Liebherr’s service is top class. It is, of course, also a benefit to stick with a single manufacturer for large cranes in terms of operation, transport and maintenance.”Wasel is planning the first jobs for the LR 11000 assembling wind turbines and it will also be used later for jobs in industry.. First job with SL10DF2BV wind power systemFor its first job, the new LR 11000 was transported to a wind farm in Coesfeld in North Rhine-Westphalia. The new flagship of the Wasel fleet had to prove itself by assembling a wind turbine with a hub height of 170 metres. Julian Schmidt, Technical Director at Wasel, takes up the story: “The powerful SL10 boom was an important criterion for the LR 11000. And we need all its power here at this wind farm. 136 tonnes including the hook block and fastening equipment had to be hoisted to an extreme height of 170 metres with a radius of 29 metres.”. For this job, the crane was set up with the special SL10DF2BV wind turbine system – 162 metre main boom, twelve metre fixed jib, 210 tonnes of turntable ballast, 90 tonnes of central ballast and 450 tonnes of derrick ballast. “The benefits of the V-Frame and VarioTray when working with suspended ballast in the wind industry were clearly demonstrated during this very first job,” continues Schmidt.The V-frame ballast system is a hydraulically adjustable folding frame which enables the ballast radius of the LR 11000 to be infinitely adjusted between 13 and 30 metres. A rigid ballasting system is no longer required for large radii. VarioTray is a small ballast pallet, which can be unbolted quickly and easily when necessary. This avoids the need for the tiresome stacking and unstacking of ballast slabs. The large ballast pallet is only required to raise and lower the lattice boom.. Wasel employs more than 400 people and has a fleet of around 140 Liebherr mobile and crawler cranes. The customer focuses on providing hoisting and transport services. The company is also a Liebherr dealer for tower cranes and operates over 400 Liebherr tower cranes itself.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Bridge building with AS Manutention’s new LTM 1750-9.1 mobile crane,Press releases |12/08/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/bridge-building-with-as-manutentions-new-ltm-1750-91-mobile-crane.html?page=48,"Job successfully completed in Amiens, France – a new LTM 1750-9.1 from AS Manutention recently installed a pedestrian bridge. The pedestrian bridge was completed after just two days at the site. The investment in this Liebherr heavy duty crane with a lifting capacity of 800 tonnes, sees AS Manutention create a new division – ASM Heavy Lift.Find out more",Press releases,12/08/2021,"“The LTM 1750-9.1 features particularly high lifting capacities, the very latest technology and enormous variability in use”, says Sébastien Aouni, Managing Director of AS Manutention, describing the benefits of his new crane. “We plan to use the 800 tonne crane in the chemical industry, wind power, bridge building and many other sectors.”. Challenging bridge installation job for the LTM 1750-9.1Very little space was available for setting up the large crane. Smart set-up procedures, good planning and coordination within the team and the support of a Liebherr LTR 1060 telescopic crawler crane enabled the heavy duty crane to be set up smoothly. And at the end of the process the Liebherr crane stood ready for action with 154 tonnes of counterweight and a 13 metre fixed jib next to the River Somme in the Hortillonages in France, over which the new pedestrian bridge was to be installed.. First of all, the LTM 1750-9.1 installed caissons made of construction steel each measuring 20 metres in length and weighing around 20 tonnes. All the hoists were carried out using spreaders to minimise the pressure on the caissons. The maximum radius for hoisting the 20 tonne caissons was a massive 57 metres. Restricted visibility and the constricted site meant that the job was far from straightforward. The crane operator had to trust the messages he received by radio from the team for installing the caissons. The bridge was finally in situ after just two days at the site.. First investment in this class of craneAS Manutention ordered the heavy duty crane with the complete range of TYV23EN equipment. Liebherr was able to add power to the LTM 1750-9.1 around two years ago using refined static calculation methods and a new luffing jib configuration. This means, for example, that the 800 tonne crane can achieve a lifting capacity of over 65 tonnes for erecting wind turbines with a hub height of 100 metres.. “The LTM 1750-9.1 is our first investment in this class of crane. Liebherr has been a reliable partner to us since the company was founded seven years ago. All our other mobile cranes were also supplied by Liebherr”, says Sébastien Aouni. The crane and haulage contractor is based in Biesheim in Alsace, whilst it also has sites in Strasbourg and Amiens. In addition to opening its ASM Heavy Lift Division, the company has also established its own design office to enable it to plan and complete projects precisely.

Blade replacement at a wind farm – tandem hoist by Liebherr mobile cranes ,Press releases |12/06/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/blade-replacement-at-a-wind-farm-tandem-hoist-by-liebherr-mobile-cranes.html?page=48,"Crane and transport contractor Grúas Ibarrondo took two Liebherr mobile cranes, an LTM 1750-9.1 and an LTM 1650-8.1, the first in Spain, to the Experimental Cener-Alaiz wind farm in Navarra, Spain, to replace three rotor blades on a wind turbine. The 650 tonne crane has been added to the Grúas Ibarrondo fleet and will strengthen the company’s position on the market.Find out more",Press releases,12/06/2021,"In September, Grúas Ibarrondo replaced three rotor blades on an SG 4.X wind turbine, each measuring 64.5 metres in length and weighing in at 24 tonnes, with new rotor blades with a larger span, a length of 71.5 metres and weighing 22.5 tonnes each. The job at the Experimental Cener-Alaiz wind farm in Navarra was carried out using two Liebherr mobile cranes, the 9-axle LTM 1750-9.1 and the first 8-axle LTM 1650-8.1 in Spain. The project was “part of maintenance work which was carried out under the preventative service contract with our customer”, explains Mikel Ibarrondo, General Manager of Grúas Ibarrondo.The Liebherr mobile cranes worked in tandem using a hook height of 130 metres. “Liebherr mobile cranes are ideal for wind energy projects of this type as they are manoeuvrable and easy to position. They also deliver the required height and lifting capacity”, continues Mikel Ibarrondo. One of the major challenges for this job was to reach the specified height whilst also ensuring that the required lifting capacity could be delivered at that height. Furthermore, the cranes had to be controlled very sensitively as they had to install the turbine blades in tandem.Grúas Ibarrondo has always pursued a policy of the continuous modernisation of its fleet with the aim of providing its customers with excellent service quality using its technically up to date and well-maintained fleet. The company has worked with Liebherr cranes for many years for this reason and to date has certainly recorded a great deal of positive experience. “The products developed and manufactured with the Liebherr brand deliver premium technology and quality and guarantee us having a reliable partner at our side in the long term”, says Ibarrondo finally. One of the key factors behind its trust in Liebherr is the outstanding customer service, which is provided in Spain by Liebherr Ibérica and gives the company the facility to obtain support at any time and in any place, which is particularly helpful as the cranes often have to work in challenging environments. The company’s fleet consists of 66 cranes, 41 of which are Liebherr cranes, including almost every model in the LTM mobile crane series as well as a 750 tonne LG 1750 lattice boom crane..

Acciaierie d'Italia also secures an unrivalled handling performance in the MHC market with the four LPS 800s. We are looking forward to this exciting partnership,” says Andreas Müller, Liebherr Sales Director for Mobile Harbour Cranes.. LPS 800 - Portal solutionThe LHM 800 is the largest and most powerful model in the mobile harbour crane product range. Currently, over 20 units in the mobile version are in use with various customers worldwide. The long-proven design and reliability of the LHM 800 speak for themselves. Acciaierie d'Italia has ordered a customized portal version of the 800 model. Detaching the crane substructure via a portal has various advantages. The crane can move along the quay edge on the already installed rail and at the same time, the space under the portal can be used. With its portal crane models, Liebherr offers a unique combination of proven Liebherr harbour crane technology and space-saving installation on rail-mounted gantries.“Acciaierie d'Italia is a major player in the European steel business. We are proud that they have chosen the market leader in mobile harbour crane technology – Liebherr. With Mac Port Group they have acompetent and local contact on site. We will support them in all service matters and ensure maximum availability of the equipment,” comments Matteo Bilotti, Managing Director Mac Port.. Sustainable featuresThe four LPS 800 of Acciaierie d'Italia have a 4-rope configuration with a maximum lifting capacity of up to 144 tonnes. All machines are equipped exclusively with an e-drive and can thus operate without local emissions. This is in line with the current trend, which shows a clear shift in drives towards electric. The cranes are also equipped with the Pactronic hybrid power booster developed by Liebherr. The Pactronic is an additional pressure storage that accumulates sink energy or excess energy from the electric drive and returns it to the closed hydraulic circuit in the form of pressure when required. This allows the power in the lifting process to be increased. Moreover, surplus energy is not wasted but fed back into the circuit and used efficiently. These features make the LPS 800 the best performing machine in bulk handling. Handling rates of 2000 tonnes per hour are possible.Driver training for more safetyIn order to prepare both the crane operators and the technical staff of Acciaierie d'Italia in the period until delivery, various training options are currently being discussed. Liebherr's own LiSIM simulator will certainly be used in the process. Technical service training at the maritime headquarters in Rostock, Germany, is also conceivable for optimum preparation for the future handling equipment. Liebherr is able to accompany the entire acquisition process, from individual technical solutions to delivery and training.. DownloadsHere you will find the press releases and images for download..

Night shift at the steelworks,Press releases |12/01/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/night-shift-at-the-steelworks.html?page=49,Modification of a large crane system at the ArcelorMittal steelworks in Eisenhüttenstadt – crane rental contractor H.-J. Nolte Auto-Krane based in Hanover travelled to the German-Polish border region with two Liebherr LG 1750 cranes. These powerful lattice boom mobile cranes had to hoist a gantry crane to enable a second gantry crane to be rolled past underneath it. The total gross load case for the tandem hoist was 620 tonnes.Find out more,Press releases,12/01/2021,"As part of an upgrade at the converter steelworks operated by steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal in Eisenhüttenstadt, a heavyweight modification had to be completed to a large gantry crane system. The position of two cranes for transporting so-called ladles, giant containers for annealing pig iron, had to be swapped as a result of the fact that they had suffered different levels of wear.. Jürgen Peters, who planned the job for Nolte Auto-Krane at the steelworks, took two of the three large Liebherr LG 1750 lattice boom mobile cranes from the company’s fleet to handle the hoisting work. The cranes were each set up with a 70 metre main boom and derrick boom, equipped with 460 and 470 tonnes of ballast and positioned on either side of the crane track, which was around 30 metres off the floor. The operator console and trolley system for the gantry crane had to be removed before the tandem hoist could be tackled. “The preparations on the gantry crane required a great deal more time than we thought,” says Peters, “but we nevertheless managed to complete the work during the scheduled converter downtime.”. Changing positions for a longer service life The two red lattice boom craned were not able to hoist the gantry crane out of the rails and lift it around ten metres into the air until around midnight, several hours later than planned. After the second crane had been moved under the load, the two crane operators from Nolte had to lower the load carefully onto the crane rails. Changing the positions of the two gantry cranes will ensure that the whole system has a longer service life. The crane which has previously been exposed to higher loads will be exposed to lower stresses in its future position, and vice versa.ArcelorMittal manufactures high quality flat steel bars in Eisenhüttenstadt for the automotive and household appliances industries. The Brandenburg steelworks currently employs around 2700 people. The ironworks and the neighbouring town for the workforce were originally founded in 1950 with the name Eisenhüttenkombinat Ost..

Closing the gap – Colonia takes delivery of Liebherr LTM 1110 5.1 mobile crane,Press releases |11/30/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/closing-the-gap-colonia-takes-delivery-of-liebherr-ltm-1110-5-1-mobile-crane.html?page=49,"Colonia Spezialfahrzeuge Gottfried Schönges GmbH & Co. KG has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 mobile crane. The Cologne-based company will use the new 110 tonne crane to replace an LTM 1100/1, thus closing a gap between 100 and 130 tonne machines in its fleet. The successful combination of performance, compact dimensions and length was behind the decision to buy the LTM 1110-5.1.Find out more",Press releases,11/30/2021,"Colonia Managing Director Jürgen Oprée explains: “The LTM 1110 5.1 delivers excellent lifting capacity values using the counterweights it carries on the road. That is a major benefit for us because we can obtain annual road licences for our main catchment area for vehicles with a gross weight of up to 60 tonnes.” With a length of 60 metres, the telescopic boom on the LTM 1110-5.1 is one of the longest in its crane class. With a 12 tonne axle load and a gross weight of 60 tonnes, the Liebherr 110 tonne crane can carry up to 13.1 tonnes of counterweight on public roads. That is an outstanding value in the 5-axle class. It means that crane operators can complete the vast majority of crane jobs at low cost without having to transport additional ballast.In addition to performance, Oprée also mentions the length of the telescopic boom and the compact design of the LTM 1110-5.1 as the main factors behind his company choosing the Liebherr 5-axle crane. “We are located in the middle of the chemicals belt around Cologne, Leverkusen, Dormagen and Krefeld and our cranes are often used for maintenance work in chemical plants, some of which are rather aged. The LTM 1110-5.1 stands out for these jobs due to its high performance, long telescopic boom and excellent manoeuvrability”, says Oprée.Details solutions to make crane operator’s life easier are also important to the Colonia Managing Director: “On the new crane, Liebherr has made sure that there is plenty of storage space for fastening equipment and accessories”. Colonia has had a close business relationship with Liebherr for many years and the mobile crane fleet is dominated by the Liebherr brand. “Liebherr cranes are very user-friendly and in addition the support and service are excellent,” continues Oprée.Colonia Spezialfahrzeuge celebrated its 75th anniversary a year ago. It all started in 1945 with a trailer built in-house and a tractor vehicle. The company bought its first mobile cranes in the 1960s. In 2020, Colonia entered the crawler crane class with the purchase of a Liebherr LR 1800-1.0.

Nikolaus Münch, Head of the Control System Department at Liebherr in Ehingen, explains: “During the development of the new control system, it was important to us that crane operators, who are familiar with Liebherr cranes, would be able to get used to the new control system quickly and easily. At the same time, we must be future-proof as the progress currently being made in microelectronics is immense. Complex applications, such as VarioBase®, which require a great deal of performance data, can now be developed more frequently in the future. The current LICCON2 control system is reaching the limits of its capacity.”The similarities with the current control system are wide-ranging. Time-tested hardware components, such as the BTT remote control terminal, have been included. The touchscreen function on the new large display in the superstructure cab means that it is now even easier and more comfortable to control. The way in which the information is shown has also been revised and simplified. In addition, LICCON3 cranes are also prepared for telemetry and fleet management systems as standard. In the future, crane contractors will be able to view and evaluate all the relevant data using the MyLiebherr customer portal.. Driver's cab with award-winning designLiebherr has developed the modern design of the new driver's cab in collaboration with designer Jürgen R. Schmid, Design Tech, Ammerbuch (Germany). It was rewarded with the renowned American GOOD DESIGN® award 2020 in the “Transportation” category. The GOOD DESIGN® awards were started in 1950 by Eero Saarinen together with Charles and Ray Eames and are awarded to the most innovative and modern industry, product and graphic designs from all over the world. The Chicago Atheaeum Museum of Architecture and Design organises the programme to increase awareness of contemporary design and to honour leaders of both product and industry leaders in design and production.. Liebherr first unveiled its new driver's cab at the Bauma 2019 to obtain feedback from customers at an early stage of the development process. The company has managed to implement lots of ideas to mark the start of series production. Due to high synergy effects, Liebherr is introducing the new cab at the same time as the LICCON3 control system. The modern design features premium materials and timeless lines as well as delivering a whole host of improvements for the crane driver. These include the new multifunction steering wheel, side roller blind on the driver’s door, improved instruments and modules as well as new displays. Options, such as the central locking system with remote key, the cool box and tyre pressure monitoring system deliver additional comfort.A completely new, modern automatic heating and climate control system in both the driver’s and operator’s cabs guarantees comfortable working conditions. A sun sensor detects strong sunshine and automatically adjusts the heating settings. In addition to the standard radio with hands-free facility, a double DIN radio with extended functions is available as an option.Nikolaus Münch believes that the revised lighting system is another highlight: “LED technology is a real plus as a result of its long service life. It will last for many more hours of service and also provides better lighting.” The lighting packages for the crane cabs, the superstructure, the rear of the vehicle, the front headlights and the telescopic boom and lattice jibs have been improved and now feature LEDs.. ZF TraXon DynamicPerform gearboxThe innovative DynamicPerform clutch module delivers almost zero wear starting and manoeuvring for the modular ZF TraXon gearbox without overheating. The new clutch module transmits the engine power via an oil-cooled plate pack that runs in oil. The friction heat generated when starting is dissipated in the clutch oil and supplied to the vehicle’s cooling system via an oil/water heat exchanger. Due to the higher energy and power consumption, together with a calculation model, permanent and almost wear-free manoeuvring is made possible. An implemented clutch protection function also prevents overheating of the clutch and the associated increased wear or destruction of the clutch in extreme load cases. That prevents downtimes and helps to significantly extend the service life of the drivetrain. Crane owners therefore benefit from greater efficiency and falling maintenance costs while drivers will have their workload reduced by the highly controllable clutch.Liebherr was ZF’s partner in the development of the TraXon DynamicPerform and its integration in the drivetrain of mobile cranes. Josef Schick, Head of the Testing Department at Liebherr, says: “As a result of the close collaboration with ZF and a very intensive phase of testing, the new gearbox version is now ready for widespread use. The cooling performance of the DynamicPerform clutch module has been significantly increased yet again by means of improvements to various hardware components. The model has also been refined for calculating the disc temperature. Vehicle tests in a refrigeration chamber at temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees have confirmed that DynamicPerform works very well even in extremely low temperatures. We have managed to solve all the initial problems. Overall we can safely say that there are worlds of differential between a dry clutch and the new wet starting clutch!”Initially, Liebherr plans to install DynamicPerform in its 5-axle mobile cranes on a step by step basis. On mobile cranes with six or more axles, Liebherr intends to continue to use the ZF 12-speed TraXon Torque gearbox with starting converter, which in addition to zero wear manoeuvring, also delivers an increase in torque..

New cranes to celebrate company anniversary – Hanyš updates fleet with Liebherr cranes,Press releases |11/24/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-cranes-to-celebrate-company-anniversary-hanys-updates-fleet-with-liebherr-cranes.html?page=50,"By the end of 2021, Czech crane rental and heavy haulage contractor Hanyš will have almost 100 Liebherr cranes at its yard. And the fleet will continue to grow – 18 more Liebherr cranes will be added in the year of the company’s 30th anniversary.Find out more",Press releases,11/24/2021,"30 years ago, on 4 July 1991, the Hanyš family started its crane rental business in the Czech capital Prague. Today, Hanyš has 20 sites in Czechia and one in Slovakia offering crane and heavy haulage services. Additional Czech sites will be added starting in 2022. And the crane rental contractor needs new machines for them. 18 Liebherr cranes will shortly be updating and strengthening the fleet, representing the largest order in Hanyš corporate history. The range extends from the 30 tonne LTM 1030 2.1 to an LG 1750 lattice boom mobile crane. All the cranes will be delivered over the next few months.. It all started with an LTM 1070/1“After I officially founded Hanyš in July 1991, my first crane was an AD 20. The truck-mounted crane on a Tatra chassis had a lifting capacity of 20 tonnes. We quickly added a second crane, and AD 28, followed by a Coles 64 T. And then I saw a Liebherr LTM 1070/1 for the very first time. It was an accident-damaged crane which was standing in the yard at KLIMEX CZ. I decided I had to stop and take a closer look at that crane”, says Rostislav Hanyš, founder and proprietor of Hanyš. “At the time, we took back the all-terrain crane as an accident-damaged crane, we repaired it and finally sold it to Hanyš”, says Karel Kladiva, the proprietor of Liebherr dealer KLIMEX CZ. “That marked the start of our partnership, which continues today and is growing ever closer”, continues Hanyš. “It quickly became clear to me that Liebherr is the number one in the market for mobile and crawler cranes. And I want to be the leading crane rental contractor in Czechia. If you want to be number one, you need top quality machinery and equipment. That is why the LTM 1070/1 marked the start of our partnership – and today we have lots of cranes, almost all of them supplied by Liebherr.”. Hanyš relies on both time-tested and new Liebherr technologyThere are plenty of bestsellers among the 18 models – proven LTM models such as the LTM 1030-2.1, the bestselling all-terrain crane in the world, the LTM 1055-3.2 and the LTM 1070-4.2. The LTC 1050-3.1 is the outstanding machine in the compact crane class, whilst the LTR 1060 takes the honours among telescopic crawler cranes. But Hanyš is also very interested in acquiring the very latest technology. The order also includes the LTM 1120-4.1, which was first unveiled in 2020, and the LTM 1230-5.1, which was demonstrated for the first time at the Bauma in 2019. The new large order will not only extend the fleet but, in some cases, it also includes replacements for old cranes. “We want to provide our customers with top technology at all times. We need good cranes for that, which is why we are continually upgrading our fleet. We now have almost 100 Liebherr cranes in our fleet, operating throughout Czechia and Slovakia”, says Milan Hanyš, who now manages the company alongside his father. Over the last five years, Hanyš has taken delivery of around 60 Liebherr cranes.. Fleet dominated by LiebherrToday, the fleet comprises 108 cranes, 98 percent have been supplied by Liebherr. In addition to telescopic cranes with lifting capacities between 30 and 500 tonnes, from the LTM 1030-2.1 to the LTM 1500-8.1, Hanyš has also been working with three Liebherr crawler cranes since 2016 – an LR 1750, an LG 1550 and, now also an LG 1750, which was delivered this year to supplement the company’s portfolio of lattice boom cranes. The main reason behind the range of Liebherr cranes is ensuring customer satisfaction, for which Hanyš needs machines which ooze quality, high standards and safety. Hanyš has a total workforce of over 220 people located at its sites throughout Czechia. In addition to crane work, they also provide heavy haulage services using the company’s own fleet of 30 vehicles.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Four new Liebherr machines for Feickert ,Press releases |11/24/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/four-new-liebherr-machines-for-feickert.html?page=50,"Feickert Bauunternehmen have been providing quality work in civil and special civil engineering for more than 70 years – and do so using powerful and high-quality earthmoving machines from Liebherr. Half of the comprehensive machine fleet of Feickert which includes around 220 machines are Liebherr machines. This year the company, which has maintained business relationships with Liebherr since 1955, invested in four more earthmoving machines, and upgraded with Liebherr quick coupler systems, hydraulic oils and data transmission systems.Find out more",Press releases,11/24/2021,"The four new earthmoving machines, two wheeled excavators and two crawler excavators, have been demonstrating their skills in Feickert Bauunternehmen since spring 2021. They are initially being used on construction sites in road construction and civil engineering or canal and water pipeline construction. For the diverse requirements in this area Feickert used a comprehensive portfolio of tool attachments and quick coupler systems from Liebherr.In the day-to-day construction site operation the company also relies on the products and services from Liebherr which are optimally adapted to the machines. For example, the company uses high-quality and environmentally friendly Liebherr hydraulic oils for its entire fleet. Using the data transmission and positioning system LiDAT, Feickert manages its fleet comprehensively and efficiently.. Four new Liebherr earthmoving machines complement fleetThe fleet now includes two more A 918 Compact Litronic wheeled excavators, an R 914 Compact Litronic crawler excavator, as well as an R 930 Litronic crawler excavator. The A 918 Compact short-tail wheeled excavator, which was developed and produced at Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH, is the ideal high-performance machine for confined spaces with its high lift capacities and digging forces with a short tail swing of 1.85 metres. The wheeled excavator sets new standards especially with regard to fuel efficiency, driving performance and safety. The Liebherr R 914 Compact crawler excavator also impresses with diverse application possibilities thanks to its compact design and the tight tail swing of 1.55 metres. The small dimensions allow the machine to be easily moved from one construction site to the next. The Liebherr R 930 Litronic crawler excavator is part of the new Generation 8, which includes a total of seven models from 22 to 45 tonnes. The machine has been designed to provide better comfort and safety, as well as optimum ergonomics and performance. Both crawler excavators are developed and produced at Liebherr-France SAS in Colmar.Apart from the decade-long and trusting partnership with Liebherr, for Ragnar, Hauke and Senior Rudolf Feickert, Managing Directors of Feickert Bauunternehmen, it was primarily the proven product quality, the superb performance, as well as the sophisticated technical level of the machines that made them decide once again in favour of Liebherr products. But for Ragnar Feickert the focus was also on the high level of efficiency: ""We have over 60 years of experience with Liebherr machines. They combine maximum productivity with excellent efficiency, a complete investment."". Tool attachments and quick coupler systems from Liebherr allow more applications and higher machine utilisationThe requirements at Feickert of the Liebherr machines are high, the applications are diverse. Apart from the comprehensive fleet, the company owns around 350 mechanical and hydraulic tool attachments, the majority of which are from Liebherr: ""We use backhoe buckets, ditch-cleaning buckets and swivel buckets,"" adds Hauke Feickert. Classic grab and loading tasks are carried out with the Liebherr backhoe buckets. Whereas for trench and trough construction, the Liebherr ditch-cleaning buckets are used for creating embankments and verges, as well as levelling. Liebherr swivel buckets are genuine all-rounders: They are characterised by the 2x50° tilt range, and can be used for both excavating and for working on embankments and slopes.For more productivity, efficiency and safety on the construction site, Feickert relies on the fully hydraulic quick coupler system LIKUFIX® from Liebherr. The combination of a hydraulic Liebherr quick coupler with the LIKUFIX coupling block permits fast, safe changing of mechanical and hydraulic tool attachments from the cab. ""Thanks to LIKUFIX® we are expanding the applications of our hydraulic excavators and wheel loaders considerably and in doing so can significantly increase the utilisation per machine. The fully hydraulic quick coupler system also offers us the necessary flexibility that we need for executing special construction projects"", highlights Hauke Feickert. If site work requires a special tool attachment such as an attachment compactor, for example, the construction company is happy to rely on the comprehensive service offer of Liebherr Rental Services. With LIKUFIX® the tool attachment can be changed quickly and simply. Today in the Feickert fleet every hydraulic excavator as well as the wheel loaders in the mid-size series from Liebherr are equipped with LIKUFIX®. ""We are very satisfied with the system. It is extremely robust, safe and reliable"", says Axel Schupp, Head of Machine Technology at Feickert Bauunternehmen.. Use of high-quality and environmentally friendly Liebherr hydraulic oilsLiebherr machines are designed so that they can withstand high stress. Regular maintenance with high-quality lubricants and operating fluids is essential to ensure lasting efficiency. Therefore, in 2019 the construction company decided to convert its entire 220 machine fleet to the biodegradable hydraulic oil ""Liebherr Hydraulic Plus"". ""The oil is specially developed and tested for Liebherr machines, meets the high Liebherr standards and has a long life"", states Thomas Lange, responsible sales representative of Liebherr-Baumaschinen Vertriebs- und Service GmbH in the Frankfurt am Main branch.Liebherr Hydraulic Plus is an ash-free, biodegradable high-performance hydraulic fluid for use in environmentally sensitive areas. Excellent properties such as very good sealing compatibility, low foaming tendency, optimal ageing stability and good corrosion protection protect the hydraulic components. Fully synthetic polyalphaolefins are the basis of the environmentally friendly hydraulic oil. They have excellent smooth running properties, which has a positive influence on fuel consumption. With appropriate oil care and monitoring, the change intervals can also be extended and operating times of up to 10,000 operating hours are achievable. Senior Managing Director Rudolf Feickert highlights: ""At Feickert we don't just talk about environmental awareness, we are environmentally conscious. The changeover of oils took several years, 70,000 litres of oil were required. Countless workshop hours and shipments were needed. Now all our machines can also be used everywhere, also in water protection areas. We work for occupational safety and environment protection. We are proud of this."". Comprehensive fleet management with the data transmission and positioning system LiDAT Feickert Bauunternehmen offer their services at locations in Germany and Luxembourg. Every year the company looks after up to 240 construction sites. For efficient maintenance, optimised operational planning and monitoring of all machines remotely, for several years now Feickert has been successfully using the data transmission and positioning system LiDAT from Liebherr. Almost every machine in the Feickert fleet is now equipped with LiDAT. The LiDAT telematics system provides information on the pinpointing and operation of the machines. ""With LiDAT we can view and manage our entire fleet at any time from our head office in Weilburg"" says Axel Schupp. ""As a result, we know where the machines are and receive comprehensive information on operating and usage times, fuel consumption, as well as service intervals."". Feickert Bauunternehmen Feickert Bauunternehmen was founded in 1947 by Walter Feickert in Weilburg-Gaudernbach (Hesse). In the beginning the focus was on building and railroad construction, from the 1970s pipeline and canal construction. Today the family-run company concentrates on civil engineering, particularly the difficult canal and water pipeline constructions, as well as road construction and earthmoving. Other fields of application include metal working and engineering and special civil engineering. Today around 370 people work at Feickert at a total of four locations in Hesse, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Luxembourg.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Euroports invests in emission-free LPS 420 E,Press releases |11/22/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/euroports-invests-in-emission-free-lps-420-e.html?page=50,"Liebherr will be supplying Euroports Germany with an all-electric portal crane next year. All crane movements of the pioneering machine will be carried out by means of emission-free electric motors. With this sustainable investment, Euroports is increasing the handling capacity of its bulk terminal at Rostock's overseas port.Find out more",Press releases,11/22/2021,"Euroports Germany is the largest port-handling company in the Rostock overseas port and in the whole of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The company constantly responds to changing market conditions to enable its customers to handle goods efficiently. In recent years, Euroports Germany has already invested in two Liebherr cranes for its general cargo terminal in Rostock's overseas port. The two LHM 550 mobile harbour cranes are the backbone of the handling of wind turbines and allow for increased container handling resulting from the New Silk Road. The equally increased volume of bulk goods prompted Euroports to put an LHM 280 into operation at short notice. In order, to further increase the handling capacity and to create the necessary replacement for two harbour cranes, a further machine will soon strengthen the Euroports crane fleet. In the summer of 2022, Liebherr will deliver an all-electric LPS 420 E to its neighbour in Rostock's overseas port.""We want to further strengthen the handling performance at our bulk terminal. In the coming year, we are not only investing in a new crane to be even more efficient, but we also want to make our contribution to sustainability,"" says Karsten Lentz Managing Director of the Euroports Germany Group. ""We have opted for a fully electric crane, the LPS 420 E. In future, the crane will be used to handle all types of goods at this terminal. In addition to building materials, this also includes ores, lime, gypsum, wood chips and many more,"" adds Lentz.. All-electric dynamicsThe all-electric gantry crane is designed for ports and terminals with electric infrastructure. All crane movements such as luffing, lifting, slewing and travelling movements are carried out by means of emission-free electric motors and are therefore not hydraulic. With an outreach of up to 48 metres, ships up to Post-Panamax class can be served. The LPS 420 E has a maximum lifting capacity of up to 124 tonnes and impresses with several decisive technical advantages.The main components of the electric drive are liquid-cooled and the heat is dissipated via heat exchangers mounted outside the crane. Externally mounted cooling units have the advantage, especially in bulk handling that no air is brought into the interior of the crane. This keeps dust contamination to a minimum. Thanks to the Liebherr active front-end frequency converter, deviations in the power supply can be easily compensated for safe and stable operation. The machine is equipped with high-performance power accumulators to reduce the peak load in the crane's main power supply and to use regenerative energy within the system. In addition, the synchronous electric motors have a low moment of inertia and provide fast response for precise driving characteristics.. Increasing electrificationThe electrification of drives is reaching a new level, and this is also the case in the maritime industry. A clear shift in focus in favour of electrified cranes is evident. In addition to increased demand for hybrid drive concepts consisting of a diesel engine and an electric motor, fully electric solutions are also increasingly coming into focus. Liebherr Rostock has already sold numerous LPS 420 E all-electric portal cranes to its international customers. The unit for Euroports Germany is now the first in the European market..

The Bavarian contractor is expanding its crane fleet with the 120 tonne machine. The extremely compact design of the 4-axle crane and its high lifting capacities were major factors behind the decision to buy the new crane.Find out more,News,11/19/2021,"Managing Director Roland Mikschl explains: “The future is small, compact but powerful mobile cranes because sites are becoming more and more restricted and have less space for cranes. That is why we were looking for a powerful 4-axle crane, which we found at Liebherr.”The LTM 1120-4.1 is the most powerful 4-axle all-terrain crane ever built. The Liebherr 120 tonne machine breaks into a performance class which has previously been the sole preserve of 5-axle cranes. As far as boom length is concerned, it is on a par with 200-tonne class cranes as its 66 metre telescopic boom is the longest ever to be installed on a 4-axle mobile crane.Mikschl Autokrane GmbH is a reliable, strong partner in the industry, construction and transport sectors. With an extensive fleet of telescopic cranes, mobile construction cranes, trucks, tractor units and a wide range of semi-trailers and trailers, the company now only tackles everyday work professionally, but also special projects."
Premiere – first Liebherr compact cranes with rope pull technology delivered,Press releases |11/18/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/premiere-first-liebherr-compact-cranes-with-rope-pull-technology-delivered.html?page=50,"Liebherr first unveiled the LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane with a second boom version in December 2020. Since then, customers have been able to choose between the TELEMATIK and rope pull mechanism versions for the compact 50 tonne model. The launch of this crane sees Liebherr round off its portfolio in the compact crane segment. The very first models of this new version were handed over to crane rental contractors Wasel in Germany and Felbermayr in Austria during October.Find out more",Press releases,11/18/2021,"Crane rental contractors Felbermayr based in Wels, Austria, and Wasel based in Bergheim near Cologne have taken delivery of the first Liebherr LTC 1050-3.1 compact cranes featuring the rope pull mechanism boom. This new boom version for the 50 tonne crane was unveiled at the end of 2020 and rounds off Liebherr’s portfolio in the compact crane segment. Since then, customers have been able to choose between the powerful, long TELEMATIK version and the familiar, high speed rope pull mechanism.. Development started at the Bauma in 2019The first talks between Matthias Wasel from Wasel, Mag. Peter Stöttinger, from Felbermayr and Dr Ulrich Hamme, Engineering and Development Director at Liebherr in Ehingen, took place at the Bauma in 2019. Both customers addressed similar requirements to Liebherr. “The LTC 1050-3.1 is a good compact crane, which particularly comes into its own when used inside buildings,” says Stöttinger. “However, TELEMATIK was not really a familiar technology for our crane operators in the compact crane segment. The rope pull mechanism has been in used for decades on small cranes and is very widespread. Our operators are very familiar with it and have come to appreciate it over many years.”“It also takes slightly longer to extend and retract the boom using TELEMATIK. Particularly when we are working inside buildings, where production often has to be stopped, every minute counts. Fast telescoping with a high load is worth its weight in gold in these situations – which is why we directly approached Liebherr with our experience at the Bauma”, says Wasel.Immediately after the Bauma, the design team at Ehingen started work on the development of the rope pull boom for the time-tested LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane. “We are always delighted when our customers come to us with valuable insights and requests, regardless of whether they refer to crane jibs, technologies or complete booms. This is yet another great example for our view that we should drive forward developments together in partnership. So it is a great pleasure for us to be able to hand over the first cranes featuring this boom technology”, says Dr Hamme.. Spoilt for choiceThe new boom with rope pull mechanism is 31 metres long and consists of a pivot section and 4 telescoping sections – one less than the TELEMATIK boom. The telescoping sections are extended and retracted using a dual-action 2-stage hydraulic cylinder. Stage 1 extends telescoping section 1. Stage 2 extends telescoping sections 2 to 4 synchronously using a 2-way pulley block. The new boom also delivers high telescoping lifting capacities, an important feature for use inside buildings. This boom can telescope at high speed using familiar technology.The TELEMATIK boom, which has been available since the market launch of the LTC 1050-3.1, delivers high lifting capacities with long booms and wide radii. But even with the booms not fully extended, TELEMATIK delivers higher lifting capacities as the individual telescoping sections can be extended in any sequence and independently of each other. “Today, customers can choose between the powerful, long TELEMATIK boom and the high speed, familiar rope pull mechanism. Depending on the applications for which the compact crane is needed, one or the other variant is better suited,"" says Dr Hamme..

Eineder modernises crane fleet with Liebherr LTM 1250-5.1 mobile crane,Press releases |11/17/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/eineder-modernises-crane-fleet-with-liebherr-ltm-1250-5-1-mobile-crane.html?page=50,Autodienst Eineder GmbH has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1250-5.1 mobile crane. It will replace an older 220 tonne crane in the Bavarian company’s fleet. The high performance and compact dimensions of the new 250 tonne crane and the possibility of obtaining road licences for 5-axle mobile cranes quickly in Bavaria were major criteria behind the decision. The LTM 1250-5.1 has been one of the most in-demand telescopic mobile cranes from Liebherr for a number of years.Find out more,Press releases,11/17/2021,"Managing Director Peter Eineder says: “We decided on the LTM 1250-5.1 because it is one of the most powerful 5-axle cranes on the market and can travel on public roads with a gross weight of just 60 tonnes. This enables us to obtain road licences more quickly in Bavaria than is possible for a 6-axle crane in the same lifting capacity class. The crane has a 60 metre boom and 88 tonnes of ballast and delivers significantly higher lifting capacity values than other 5 or even 6-axle models, which have less ballast or a longer telescopic boom.”. Powerful and compact on five axlesIn the development of the LTM 1250-5.1, Liebherr followed the concept of achieving maximum lifting capacity from the available weight of a 5-axle mobile crane. The result is that it can carry out a whole host of crane jobs which previously would have required a 6-axle mobile crane. The shorter design of its chassis also delivers benefits on restricted sites. Another great help in this respect is VarioBallast®, a Liebherr system, which was an additional factor behind Eineder’s decision to buy the new crane – the LTM 1250-5.1 can be operated with two different ballast radii, 5.58 m or 4.78 m. The ballast radius can be reduced by 800 mm quickly and easily using standard mechanically slewing ballast cylinders if things become particularly tight on site. The crane achieves its maximum lifting capacity with the large radius.. Transformer stations and aircraft“The main areas of use for the new crane include transport and loading and unloading transformer stations weighing up to 72 tonnes”, says Eineder. “We decided to buy from Liebherr again because of the reliability of the cranes as well as their modern technology and the fact that they retain their value so well.”The LTM 1250-5.1 was able to demonstrate its abilities just one day after the delivery of the new crane – it hoisted a Torndao jet weighing 20 tonnes at Airbus in Manching onto special dampers for testing vibrations. Due to the limited height of the ceiling, however, the LTM 1250-5.1 was unable to increase its radius by luffing the boom, and instead had to telescope the full load of the aircraft..

Successful in Latin America – high number of Liebherr mobile cranes heading for Chile,Press releases |11/16/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/successful-in-latin-america-high-number-of-liebherr-mobile-cranes-heading-for-chile.html?page=50,"There is high demand for mobile cranes in Latin America for the mining industry and for erecting wind turbines. Liebherr is based close to its customers in the region and also delivers reliable after sales service. The global market leader has delivered an above average number of mobile cranes to Chile this year, in particular.Find out more",Press releases,11/16/2021,"Chile is one of the leading economies in Latin America and one of the largest raw materials producers in the world. Felix Mussotter, who is responsible for Latin America in his role as Sales Representative for Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH, says: “Chile has 40 % of the established copper reserves in the world. It has the largest copper mine in the world. In addition, Chile is increasingly turning to renewable energy. This means that there is a wide range of applications for mobile cranes, for example for assembling and servicing large mining machines and for erecting wind turbines. Sales of mobile cranes in Chile is above average this year.”Special challenges Chile is a country full of geographical peculiarities. Only 120 kilometres wide on average, it reaches a north-south extension of over 4,200 kilometres with deserts, forests and eternal ice. The majority of the country consists of mountains up to 6900 metres in height. Fitted with special equipment, Liebherr machines and cranes have to satisfy high requirements, such as working at high altitudes and in extremely low temperatures.“We are naturally delighted with all the orders, but it is a genuine logistical challenge to ship so many cranes at the same time – starting from the shipping company to handing them over to the customer”, says Hubertus von Sperber, Head of the Mobile Crane Division at Liebherr in Chile.. Local service and innovative products for customers throughout Chile Liebherr attaches particular value to close contacts with its South American customers and providing them with local support. Von Sperber continues: “Our customers appreciate the direct support from Liebherr. We keep spare parts in stock in the individual countries and the service technicians are trained at Liebherr, i.e. directly by the crane manufacturer. That enables us to enter into long term partnerships with our customers.”Daniel Vega, owner of crane rental company MPM based in the capital, Santiago de Chile confirms this: “Local service from Liebherr is very important. That is why Liebherr is an important strategic partner for us.” MPM bought its first new Liebherr mobile crane in 2017. “Today we have ten mobile cranes with lifting capacities between 100 and 1200 tonnes. We prefer Liebherr cranes as a result of their high safety standards, progressive crane technology and their reliability.”Family-run Burger Grúas is also based in Santiago de Chile and operates 30 Liebherr mobile cranes with lifting capacities between 50 and 700 tonnes. Company owner Raul Burger says: “Our fleet is mainly composed of Liebherr cranes and we use them in various projects from mining and industry to renewable energy. Once again this year, we have made some big investments – we have bought an LTM 1650-8.1, two LTM 1230-5.1s, three LTM 1120-4.1s and an LTM 1060-3.1. Our aim is to provide our customers with the best possible service. That means we require the latest and most innovative technology available on the market.”Liebherr has had a close partnership with Grúas Desmadryl based in Santiago de Chile since 2006. Company owner Enrique Desmadryl says: “Currently our fleet consists of 22 cranes, including the LRT 1100-2.1 rough terrain crane and the 9-axle LTM 1750-9.1 mobile crane. We decided on Liebherr as a result of its innovative products and progressive crane technology as well as the superb support its service team provides. These points are essential for us to enable us to be there all the time for our customers and react to their needs quickly.”Liebherr in ChileBeing close to the customer and providing reliable after sales service are important factors behind Liebherr’s global success. Liebherr has a tight network of service outlets in Latin America as well. Liebherr employs more than 400 people in Chile. The majority of them are based in the workshops at large copper mines providing maintenance services for Liebherr dump trucks and mining excavators. Liebherr Chile S.p.A. based in the capital Santiago is responsible for the sales and service of mining machines, maritime cranes, tower cranes as well as mobile and crawler cranes in Chile and neighbouring markets.

Already owning a small fleet of Liebherr LTM mobile cranes, the 600 t crawler will be used for maintenace work in wind parks as well as for repowering and new installation of wind turbines in Central America.Find out more",Press releases,11/12/2021,"The 600 t crawler crane is the new highlight in the crane fleet of CMI Energia in Honduras. Beeing tasked with maintenance, repowering and the installation of new wind turbines, the LR 1600/2 will play a major role in the further development of CMI Energia. As a crane of this class is not currently available in the region, CMI decided to invest in a used Liebherr crawler crane to ensure a quick and flexible solution for the many wind power installations.. Key arguments for the LR 1600/2As larger cranes are needed to take over all the maintenance jobs in the existing wind farms in Honduras, but also to install new wind turbines, the decision to buy a 600 t crawler crane was not an easy one for CMI Energia. Already owning a small fleet of two LTM 1050-3.1, a LTM 1350-6.1 and a LTM 1500-8.1, the Liebherr brand was already quite familiar for CMI Energia. “Being a brand with high prestige in providing perfect solutions for the wind industry and based on our previous experiences with the Liebherr after sales in our region, we based our decision on trust and a well-established partnership”, explains Jay Gallegos, CEO, CMI Energia.“With this type of crane, we can react quickly and efficiently to the maintenance needs of our assets in the region. This type of crane has not been not easily available to us before, and the costs to ship such a crane in for a job are very high”, Gallegos continues: “The flexibility of adapting this crane to the different needs of maneuvers with wind turbines and the robustness to safely carry out these maneuvers, even in moderate wind conditions are most important to us. Therefore we’ve opted for an used LR 1600/2, knowing about the great service and well established Liebherr people also in the used crane business”, explains Gallegos.. Ready to turn the keyBeeing well looked after by the Liebherr used crane experts, the LR 1600/2 was purchased with a SL3 boom configuration. “This is a very well established, flexible and safe configuration for wind power jobs”, explains Jens Könneker, product manager crawler cranes at the Liebherr plant in Ehingen. In addition, a derrick boom system and an extra counterweight tray was delivered to CMI Energia to allow the service of even the larger turbines in CMI’s portfolio.Employing roughly 400 people in the Energy Business Unit, CMI Energia is one of the largest private renewable energy companies in Central America and the Caribbean.

A last goodbye – Last Liebherr LTM 1500-8.1 mobile crane goes to LOCAR,Press releases |11/11/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/a-last-goodbye-last-liebherr-ltm-1500-8-1-mobile-crane-goes-to-locar.html?page=51,"The end of an era – the last LTM 1500-8.1 left the Liebherr plant in Ehingen at the end of September. The 626th model of the most successful large crane of all time started its journey to South America. When it arrived, Brazilian crane, heavy haulage and lifting platform contractor LOCAR took delivery of the 500 tonne machine at its office in Serra in the state of Espírito Santo. The new LTM 1500-8.1 is the seventh of these cranes that LOCAR has bought over the last few years.Find out more",Press releases,11/11/2021,"Liebherr first unveiled its 8-axle LTM 1500-8.1 mobile crane 23 years ago at the Bauma 1998. With its high lifting capacity, enormous reliability and mobility on the road and on site, it has developed into a popular crane for a very wide range of uses all over the world.. The fact that the LTM 1500-8.1 can be used flexibly and universally also played an important role in LOCAR's decision. Amilcar Spinetti Filho, Technical Director at LOCAR explains: “Our 500 tonne cranes are of great strategic importance for the company as they enable us to work in various market segments such as wind power, petrochemicals and cellulose. Despite its massive power, the LTM 1500-8.1 is a crane which can be readied for use quickly and can be used for both long term and short term rentals.“Every 500 tonne mobile crane at LOCAR has been supplied by Liebherr. “We decided to stay with to ensure interchangeability. What is more, we are very satisfied with the LTM 1500-8.1 cranes in our fleet. We operate in Brazil and are represented in almost every sector of industry. Because of its versatility, we intend to use the new LTM 1500-8.1 in practically every sector we cover. Our good experience with the identical cranes we already own has shown us that this is easily possible. The LTM 1500-8.1 has become very well established in Brazil and all over the world”, says Spinetti.LOCAR ordered the new LTM 1500-8.1 with a complete set of equipment, including the 84 metre telescopic boom, to supplement the accessories of the identical machines in the fleet. This also applies to the lattice jibs and telescopic boom guying systems, which significantly increase lifting capacity and range.. LOCAR is celebrating its 33rd anniversary this year. Spinetti continues: “The crane was chosen at an important time for our company because we are celebrating 33 years of consolidation as one of the largest companies in Latin America. LOCAR has a long term, good partnership with Liebherr and we have decided to make the roots of that partnership go even deeper.”Locar Guindastes e Transportes Intermodais S.A. first opened for business in 1988 and has specialised in crane rental, heavy haulage and lifting platforms. The company currently has a 1100-strong workforce and has 200 mobile cranes in its fleet. Continuous fleet modernisation has enabled LOCAR to provide its customers with the best possible solution at all times.After several years facing a great many challenges in its market, LOCAR is optimistic about the next few years and is confident of seeing continued economic growth in its country and market.

Premiere in Canada – Guay takes delivery of its first two LTM 1110-5.1 mobile cranes,Press releases |11/10/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/premiere-in-canada-guay-takes-delivery-of-its-first-two-ltm-1110-5-1-mobile-cranes.html?page=51,"Crane and heavy haulage contractor Guay Inc. has taken delivery of two Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 cranes. They are the first cranes of this type in Canada. The 60 meter (197 ft) telescopic boom and high lifting capacities of the Liebherr 110 tonne (125 US-tons) machine were important criteria behind the Québec-based company buying the cranes. The new cranes will replace ageing 120 tonne (135 US-tons) cranes in Guay’s fleet, which comprises more than 500 cranes of different types.Find out more",Press releases,11/10/2021,"The design of the Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 has some features which are perfect for the Province of Quebec. Guillaume Gagnon, Vice-Presidentat Guay explains: “In our market, a 110 tonne (125 US-tons) crane is the largest mobile crane in which an apprentice can work as the second man in the crane alongside the operator. In addition, the axle loads and the weight distribution of the LTM 1110-5.1 are absolutely perfect and mean that we don’t have to use a boom dolly.”A long boom system twinned with high lifting capacities was also one of the reasons for Guay to make the purchase. “We can cover a similar range of work with the LTM 1110-5.1 as with our 120 tonne (135 US-tons) crane, and its main boom is 60 meters (197 ft) long, which is normally one that only larger cranes can match. Its capacity of 110 tonnes (125 US-tons) makes this the perfect crane for us to recruit new apprentices for our team”, says Gagnon.Guay is planning to use the new crane, among other things, in the centre of Montreal for hoisting work involving great heights and ranges. With the VarioBase®Plus variable supporting base, it can also be used on sites where there is restricted space for erecting the crane. VarioBase®Plus not only generates greater safety levels, but also allows higher lifting capacities, particularly when working above the outriggers.The LTM 1110-5.1 in figuresThe LTM 1110-5.1 achieves axle loads of 12 tonnes (26,400 lb) with 13.4 tonnes (29,500 lb) of ballast, but can also be driven with a gross weight of less than 48 tonnes (105,800 lb) with a maximum axle load of 10 tonnes (22,000 lb). Even with maximum ballast of 29 tonnes (63,900 lb), its axle load remains below 16 tonnes (35,300 lb). A quick-change system for the ballast slabs ensures maximum flexibility for changing the crane’s set-up. Although the new LTM 1110-5.1 is such a lightweight construction that it achieves a gross weight of 48 tonnes (105,800 lb) , its 60 meters (197 ft) telescopic boom and maximum ballast of just 29 tonnes (63,900 lb) enable it to rival the performance of similar mobile cranes on the market.The telescopic boom on the LTM 1110- 5.1 is one of the longest in its crane class. In addition, it can be supplied with a 10.8 to 19 meters (35 to 62 ft) folding jib. Two 7-meters (23 ft) lattice sections can also be installed to extend the telescopic boom to achieve the maximum hook height. This means that the LTM 1110-5.1 mobile crane can nominally achieve the same system length as larger cranes.About Guay Inc.The company has a 500-strong workforce and operates more than 500 cranes of various types. The very first Liebherr mobile crane that Guay bought was also the largest in the Liebherr portfolio, an LTM 11200-9.1, followed by an LTM 1500-8.1 and smaller LTM cranes. The number of Liebherr cranes is growing steadily. Guay has already ordered two more LTM 1110-5.1 models. “Liebherr products are reliable and have some of the most advanced technologies available on all-terrain cranes. We received fantastic support from Liebherr Canada, the sales team and from the service team”, explains Gagnon.Guay Inc. is one of the largest privately owned crane contractors in North America with more than 20 branches in the Province of Quebec. After 58 years, company founder Jean-Marc Baronet is still the owner and still has the same passion for investing in new equipment and providing his customers with the best cranes on the market..

Travelling up to the treeline with snow chains,Press releases |11/09/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/travelling-up-to-the-treeline-with-snow-chains.html?page=51,"In Austria, work is currently proceeding at full speed on the ""Salzburg line"", the country's most important electricity infrastructure project. The Salzburg line runs for a total length of 128 kilometres through the province of Salzburg in partly alpine terrain. The Liebherr mobile cranes working on the construction of the massive electricity pylons have had to access sites at altitudes of up to 1800 metres above sea level.Find out more",Press releases,11/09/2021,"A Liebherr LTM 1160-5.2 mobile crane from Austrian crane contractor Prangl GmbH has been working on the construction of electricity pylons in the Austrian mountains since February this year. The crane has had to be set up in various configurations depending on set-up area for it and the height of the pylon being erected. For the highest pylons, the LTM 1160-5.2 is set up with its maximum configuration. “Three telescopic extension each measuring seven metres on the 62 metre boom and the 19 metre double folding jib enable us to reach a maximum hoist height of 99 metres”, says Oliver Thum. He is planning and managing this extensive, challenging job for Prangl in his capacity as a Technical External Services Specialist at the company. ""We have bought a telescopic extension specially for this job. We have obtained two others from one of our other Liebherr cranes from our branch in Vienna.” These telescopic extensions can also be used for all current LTM models with lifting capacities from 100 to 180 tonnes. These lattice boom elements are even fully compatible with the LTR 1100 telescopic crawler crane.. Snow and gradients challenge cranes and driversThe crane job in the Austrian mountains will last into summer 2022 – with a few months off for a winter break. “On some occasions we actually had to put snow chains on our crane to get to the site. But we always have them with us anyway”, says Thum about this extraordinary job in the mountains where the teams had to work in snowy conditions even in May. In addition, some of the access routes for the mobile cranes involve climbing extreme gradients. “The steepest access route that we had to cover with the LTM 1160-5.2 was around 23 percent.” An LTM 1090-4.2, which, along with an LTM 1070-4.2, is also being used sporadically for this job, even had to climb access routes with a gradient of 26 percent.On the sites themselves, the cranes generally had to manage with extremely restricted set-up areas. The highly flexible VarioBase® support system, which all three of the Liebherr mobile cranes used for the job feature among their equipment, managed to overcome even restricted conditions without compromising safety or lifting capacity.. Some of the sites in the mountainous region, however, could not be reached at all with the off-road cranes. In these cases, the pylons had to be erected with the help of helicopters or using cable cars. A Liebherr crane completed the erection work lasting several days at all the other sites, however. The weight of the components of the massive pylons, which will later support high voltage cables carrying 380 kV, is up to eight tonnes. “We still have lots of pylons to install – we will certainly be working here until well into next summer”, says Oliver Thum.. So Prangl’s yellow cranes will continue to be a common sight on the partly non-metalled tracks up to the treeline. Family-run Prangl GmbH was founded in 1965 currently has a workforce of around 700, and in addition to six sites in Austria, also has offices and outlets in Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Sweden. The specialist heavy haulage, transport and lifting logistics contractor has a large fleet which includes more than 80 Liebherr mobile cranes..

The new weightlifter: LR 1400 SX,Press releases |11/09/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-new-weightlifter-lr-1400-sx.html?page=51,"“This is a big step for our location,” says Gerhard Frainer, Managing Director for Sales. “The request for a larger crane came from the market.” With the new LR 1400 SX, Liebherr-Werk Nenzing Gmbh extends its range of crawler cranes to include lifting capacities of up to 400 t. Especially satisfying: the first customers are already using the new model.Find out more",Press releases,11/09/2021,"The first LR 1400 SX have already left the Liebherr factory. With the compact transport weight of 46 t, the complete crane can be easily transported between jobsites. Platform and railings remain attached to the uppercarriage during transportation and only need to be folded down.The self-assembly system enables quick assembly. “You can operate the whole crane with the remote control,” enthuses Paul Belcher, Owner and Managing Director of Mountain Crane Service, USA. This allows for a better overview and increases safety on site.. Despite its size, the LR 1400 SX has a wide range of applications and has already convinced the first German customer, Depenbrock, with its flexibility. “For barge operation, the available barge load charts for any configuration and any possible counterweight combination are crucial. The modular counterweight system is very good. If a smaller counterweight is sufficient, the unit can also be used on a correspondingly smaller barge. “This makes the use of the LR 1400 SX very flexible,” says Andreas Handel, Head of Mechanical Engineering Hydro Construction.Just how flexible and mobile the crane is, can be seen when space is restricted. The four crawler drives make it easier to manoeuvre the LR 1400 SX on jobsites where space is tight. Thanks to the track width adjustment, access on narrow roads is enormously simplified.. Highest level of safetyThe crane designers paid particular attention to the safety concept. The assistance system “Gradient Travel Aid” helps to negotiate slopes and inclines. It displays the crane’s centre of gravity and warns the operator before the crane leaves the safe area.The Ground Pressure Visualization of the LR 1400 SX calculates the current ground pressure of the crane in real time and compares it with the specified safety limits of the relevant position. The ground pressure is displayed in the operator's cab and the operator is permanently aware of whether the machine is situated in, or is approaching, a critical area. “This is a super feature. We have to constantly observe and monitor the ground conditions,” says Paul Belcher.The ground pressure of the crane can also be reduced using the ground pressure reduction plates. “Specifically, the wide crawlers and the ground pressure reduction plates convinced us,” says Ludger Holtmann, Technical Director at Depenbrock and adds, “the free-fall winches, which are required for some applications, were also decisive for the purchase.”.

Liebherr tower cranes get new touch display with smart operating system,Press releases |11/04/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-tower-cranes-get-new-touch-display-with-smart-operating-system.html?page=51,"It’s essential for crane operators to have key operating settings in view at all times to ensure safe and precise lifting – and these need to be presented with clarity. Along with its intuitive TC-OS user interface, the new-generation EMS-4 brings together these two requirements in a twelve-inch display. Crane operators and assembly engineers will now be able to navigate their way through a menu structure geared to their needs via multi-touch technologyFind out more",Press releases,11/04/2021,"Liebherr is in the process of delivering its first tower cranes featuring a newly developed display. The 12-inch display with multi-touch technology and intuitive operation now comes as standard in EC-B and EC-H series tower crane cabins. For crane operators and assembly engineers, this fourth-generation Electronic Monitoring System (EMS) brings major improvements in operability and especially in terms of crane scaling.. The long-life EMS-4 display with the new Tower Cranes Operating System (TC-OS) user interface is the timely successor to the EMS-3. For its development, Liebherr enlisted the experienced support of the experts at User Interface Design GmbH. The focus for the development process was on eliminating distractions and displaying exactly the right elements required. The result is a streamlined menu structure with easily recognisable icons and symbols. Navigation is simple, intuitive and satisfying. Exceptional usability means that training and familiarisation times are reduced.. Increased operational efficiency for top slewing cranes“We’re the first to use these displays as we test every new crane before delivery. I really like the new user interface: it’s easy to understand, logically structured and tailored to the needs of different users”, says Liebherr employee Viktor Zhezher. Together with his colleagues in Production, he sees the new display in action every day at the testing station, “Everything is much faster. Control via tapping and swiping is already totally familiar to me from tablet and smartphone use.”Crane operators and assembly engineers have specific menus, a wide range of languages and relevant units of measurement (metric and Anglo-American systems) at their disposal. The clear menu structure ensures that they always have an overview, even during crane operations or crane scaling in difficult conditions. This offers extra safety and a more comfortable user experience. Even in difficult lighting conditions, which are often encountered in crane cabins, the anti-reflective and dirt-resistant touchscreen provides optimal readability. There are different viewing modes available for daytime and nighttime working. The display can also be tilted and rotated.. All essential information on one displayPersonalised settings that are relevant to the job in question can be saved via crane operator profile and retrieved at the start of a shift. Display masks can be combined in various ways for this. An external screen for the hook camera is no longer necessary as the image can be integrated into the EMS-4. This means that all available data is visible to the crane operator on one device, enabling them to carry out lifts with even greater precision and safety.The introduction of the new display also increases operator comfort in terms of crane cabin settings. For instance, the air-conditioning system and windshield wipers can be conveniently controlled via the multi-touch display. It is also possible to use the ergonomically positioned, easy-to-reach membrane keys for such purposes. Everything is networked together so that each control element displays the same information..

Liebherr blade bearings for tomorrow’s service operations,News |11/03/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-blade-bearings-for-tomorrows-service-operations-news.html?page=51,"Liebherr opens up new possibilities for wind turbine operators and service providers with optimised blade bearings in 3-row roller bearing design. Thanks to said bearings, the service life of wind turbines is extended even under high loads.Find out more",News,11/03/2021,"A new chapter in service operations: Liebherr is now also offering the state-of-the-art 3-row roller bearing design as a blade bearing. It is proven in series production and is an alternative lifetime upgrade for the maintenance and operation (O&M) of older wind turbine models. This improved solution from Liebherr-Components replaces the traditional 2-row ball slewing rings commonly available on the market and brings with it significant advantages. When used as a blade bearing, the 3-row roller bearings show great potential in terms of dimensioning, load absorption, as well as a significantly longer service life. Liebherr blade bearings demonstrate these benefits on a daily basis in numerous projects of major wind turbine manufacturers and operators worldwide. For a major repowering project of a global multi-brand service provider in the USA, Liebherr supplies more than 650 products, including 3-row roller slewing rings as blade bearings, as well as pitch and yaw gearboxes.Liebherr's technical expertise in the Components product segment is based on over 26 years of experience in the manufacturing of slewing bearings for the wind industry and far beyond for other industries. To date, Liebherr has delivered more than 9,000 series-produced roller bearings to market-leading, large and small niche wind turbine manufacturers. This number continues to grow steadily.When developing bearings for the service market, Liebherr does not only focus on the given market requirements and those of wind turbine manufacturers, but also on the needs of the O&M market. In doing so, the Liebherr team analyses damage patterns in the field and optimises products to avoid them. The trick is to apply already proven, yet modern technology to existing adjacent structures to create a more resistant, durable product that fits into the same installation space.The 3-row roller blade bearing perfectly matches these criteria: With constant dimensions and easy interchangeability, the enhanced bearing carries higher loads and reduces known damage patterns, such as edge wear. With their stronger load capacity, long maintenance intervals and significantly extended service life of up to 50%, they ensure permanent availability and thus reduced operating and investment costs over the entire service life of wind turbines. This prevents further cost-intensive blade bearing exchanges, as well as long downtimes and the resulting yield losses. ""However, it is not only the wind turbine owners, operators and service providers, who can benefit from this, but also the environment,"" explains Zina Charis Gebauer, Business Development Manager Wind Aftermarket at Liebherr-Components AG. ""Fewer replacement components reduce the consumption of resources and the CO2 production incurred not only in the manufacturing process, but also within the entire value chain, such as the raw material supply and global logistics,"" Gebauer concludes."

A multitude of recycling plants – approved in accordance with the German Emission Control Act (BImSchG) – operate at the complex, and a total of up to one million tonnes of mineral and non-mineral construction waste is processed, handled, and reused annually. The new Liebherr wheel loaders feed crushers and screeners with construction waste and load lorries with processed material. The L 586 XPower®, Liebherr's largest wheel loader, only requires two to three cycles to load a lorry. This ensures quick and resource-efficient handling of material.. Economical and resource-efficient due to power-split transmission“Powerful, efficient and noticeably more fuel-efficient than the competition: these were the reasons behind our purchasing decision,” reveals BTB Group Berlin company owner Philip Breul. The power-split drive concept of the XPower® wheel loaders is what enables this. XPower® provides a combination of hydrostatic and mechanical drives. The interaction between the two adapts automatically and continuously to the respective application. This, together with Liebherr Power Efficiency (LPE), ensures a fuel reduction of up to 30% compared with other wheel loaders in this size class.. Liebherr integrates special paintwork for wheel loaders directly into the production process Having a fleet painted in the company's own design is not only good marketing, but also a source of pride for many organizations. For this reason, the BTB Group ordered the three new L 586 XPower® units from Liebherr in its company colours. The specialists at Liebherr's Bischofshofen plant implement special paintwork directly in the production process. This means that the individual components are painted before assembly and then incorporated into the regular production process. This procedure saves subsequent painting and manual reworking. Liebherr thus achieves a higher degree of quality with custom paintworks.. Forward-looking and innovative: BTB Group Berlin as a growing family businessLike Liebherr, the BTB Group Berlin is a family-run company that stands for versatility in the construction industry. In 1990, Reimar Breul founded the steadily-growing company, which now has over 100 employees. As a specialist in civil engineering, demolition, disposal, and recycling, the BTB Group is in charge of numerous major construction sites in the Berlin area. The company is forward-looking in the field of recycling and uses innovative concepts to produce new building materials from what was once useless construction waste, all of which is aided by numerous construction machines from Liebherr..

Rounding off the portfolio – Seeland decides to purchase the Liebherr LTM 1150-5.3,Press releases |11/03/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/rounding-off-the-portfolio-seeland-decides-to-purchase-the-liebherr-ltm-1150-5-3.html?page=52,Gustav Seeland GmbH has purchased a 150 tonne mobile crane to meet high demand. A Liebherr LTM 1150-5.3 has now rounded off the Hamburg-based crane and heavy haulage contractor’s portfolio. The very latest crane technology and long term partnership were key factors in choosing Liebherr once again.Find out more,Press releases,11/03/2021,"Liebherr first unveiled the LTM 1150-5.3 a year ago using the slogan “The jewel in your fleet” – not at a trade show as is the standard procedure, but virtually as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. This flexible all-rounder has the longest telescopic boom in this crane class at 66 metres and can compete with crane models in the 200 tonne lifting capacity class. It delivers outstanding lifting capacities when fully raised and at large radii. And it is immediately ready for use once it reaches the site. This is because the new 150 tonne crane carries nine tonnes of a ballast with a gross weight of 60 tonnes. That means it can complete lots of jobs without requiring additional ballast transport vehicles. That saves time, money and makes the crane even more valuable to crane contractors.Managing Director at Gustav Seeland GmbH, Johann Evers, explains: “We identified the need in the market and invested on the basis of customer demand. After holding internal discussions with our dispatch and crane operators, we decided on the Liebherr 150 tonner. The LTM 1150-5.3 will enhance the Seeland crane portfolio.”The important thing for Seeland was that the crane is state of the art to enable the contractor to offer its customers individual modern crane solutions and services. The LTM 1150-5.3 will be used, among other things, for internal relocations, alignment work, assembly jobs, bridge installations, loading and unloading jobs, handling work and recovery jobs.. Long term partnershipGustav Seeland GmbH has a long term business relationship with Liebherr. The company has an 80-strong workforce and operates a total of 17 cranes in a wide variety of designs. Eight of its ten all-terrain cranes have been supplied by Liebherr. In summer 2021, an LTM 1060-3.1 was added to the fleet and an LTF 1045-4.1 truck mounted telescopic crane is scheduled to be delivered shortly.

Mobile harbour cranes with electric drive in high demand,Press releases |11/03/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/mobile-harbour-cranes-with-electric-drive-in-high-demand.html?page=52,"In the 2021 sales year, demand for Liebherr mobile harbour cranes with an e-drive has risen sharply. Compared to 2019, the number of units equipped with an electric motor has even doubled. Liebherr has been successfully using a hybrid drive concept consisting of a diesel engine and an electric drive for the mobile harbour cranes product segment for over 20 years. In addition to emission-free handling, the benefits of e-drive include cost savings and less maintenance.Find out more",Press releases,11/03/2021,"Electrification is entering a new market phase. A significant shift in focus for electrified cranes can be observed. Liebherr has been offering a hybrid drive concept consisting of a diesel engine and an electric motor for its maritime mobile harbour cranes for over 20 years. The diesel engine is used exclusively for moving the crane along the quayside. As soon as the crane has reached the desired position, the machine is connected to the local power grid by cable. The actual handling of goods is thus possible without emissions.If required, during operation with an electric drive, the energy recovered from the lowering can be fed into the local power grid. In this way, the operational cost of electrically driven cargo handling can be reduced even further.Hydrostatic drive conceptAll Liebherr mobile harbour cranes are equipped with the hydrostatic drive concept widely used in the Liebherr Group. The principle is based on a main drive that supplies power to pumps and a hydraulic transfer gearbox. The main drive can be a diesel engine or an electric motor. All energy-consuming movements are connected to a closed hydraulic circuit and are fed by it when required. Closed hydraulic loops are used for all main functions such as hoisting, slewing and luffing. The benefits of the hydrostatic drive are extremely precise control, a minimum number and size of components and reduced fuel consumption thanks to the standard use of reverse power. Compared to other drive systems in the market, this innovative drive principle generally saves diesel or energy during crane operation and enables sustainable and efficient operation.Strong increase in demandThis type of hybrid drive concept has been used successfully for many years. It is noticeable that the demand for electric motors with power from the local electricity grid has increased enormously in the last two years. Compared to 2019, the demand for LHM cranes with an e-drive has doubled. In the meantime, more than a third of all Liebherr mobile harbour crane orders have an e-drive installed - and the trend is rising. Retrofitting electric drives is also possible and is increasingly being used by mobile harbour crane customers.Various e-drive optionsFor emission-free operation of the LHM, it can be connected to a low-voltage network from 400 volts or a high-voltage network up to 20 kV. In the case of a high-voltage supply, this is converted into low voltage via a transformer mounted on the undercarriage, so that only low voltage is present in the crane itself. Liebherr offers the option of a cable-reeling drum for the safe movement of the crane with the cable. Cable lengths of between 70 metres and 200 metres can be accommodated, depending on the voltage present at the feed point. This ensures emission-free electrical travel of the crane along the quayside, as well as e-powered lifting.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

As a development partner and system supplier for climate-friendly injection technology, Liebherr offers solutions for hydrogen combustion engines that can be used in on- and off-highway applications. In Deggendorf (Germany), Liebherr-Components has been developing climate-friendly injection concepts for heavy-duty engines in the range of 6 - 16 litres displacement at 200 - 450 kW power rate for some time now. Upon development, the Liebherr team on site keeps close contact with leading OEMs.. Focusing on low-pressure direct injectionDevelopment work in the injection systems product area focuses on low-pressure direct injection (LPDI). ""The greatest challenges represent different combustion processes and the behaviour of the hydrogen as a medium,"" explains Richard Pirkl, technical managing director at Liebherr-Components Deggendorf GmbH. ""The concept of the H2 injector must ensure stable, precise and leak-free injection. To achieve this, our experts in Deggendorf place particular emphasis on maximum hydrogen tightness,"" Pirkl continues. A 2-valve concept ensures that H2 leakage is kept as low as possible. Depending on the particular configuration, the LPDI injector is designed for system pressures of up to 60 bar. Typical applications usually lie in the range of 30 bar. Initial test results show promising behaviour of the injector in terms of injection rate and small-volume capability. The component thus covers a wide range of applications. Today's prototypes allow customer-specific screw inserts to interface with the hydrogen connection. They are geared towards most common connection types and offer the greatest possible flexibility in engine development. The blow cap also promises flexible handling. It is easy to replace, and its asymmetrical geometry makes an individual injection angle in the combustion chamber possible. This ensures integration into different engines with sometimes widely differing installation situations. With its flexible design, Liebherr's LPDI hydrogen injector supports a wide range of customer-specific requirements and modular installation - centrally, laterally and at different angles.. Continuing a systems approachDiscussions lead with OEMs along with current market developments show, that many engine manufacturers prefer fully integrated H2 injection systems to a single-component solution. The Liebherr team in the injection systems product area pursues this approach with its common-rail solutions for diesel fuels and continues to do so with alternative fuels. Thereby, Liebherr focuses on the sizing and design of a fully comprehensive H2 injection system, including system pressure control. This means that customers continue to enjoy the benefits of an integrated solution. In addition to the injector, the experts in Deggendorf are currently working on the development and integration of further components for system solutions.Usage characteristics correspond diesel driveThe goal of Liebherr's hydrogen injection technology is to ensure that the suitability of the gas injection system (GIS) meets the transient requirements of the engine. This system-oriented approach combines various components to control pressure and flow. It does so in such a way, that the usage characteristics come close to a diesel engine, while maintaining a robust system design..

Christophe Sanchez is succeeding Martin Schickel at the helm of the historic Liebherr site in France. Liebherr-France SAS, founded 60 years ago, is responsible, among other things, for the development and production of the group's crawler excavators in Colmar.Christophe Sanchez takes over the reinsMr Sanchez joined Liebherr-France SAS in 2002 as Export Manager for Italy, Spain and North America. In 2007, he became sales manager for the industrial and electric excavators produced at the Colmar site. From 2012 to 2020, he was General Director of Liebherr EMtec Italia SpA, which is responsible for sales and after-sales service of Liebherr construction machinery on the Italian market. On 1 June 2020, he has already taken over the management of Liebherr-Location France SAS from Martin Schickel. He has also been General Director of Liebherr-France SAS since 1 November 2021.Liebherr-France SAS: a site undergoing full expansionWhen Hans Liebherr, the founder of the Liebherr Group, decided 60 years ago to build a new production facility for crawler excavators, he chose Colmar for several reasons: On the one hand, because the city of Colmar was already a European hub for numerous important transport routes at that time. Secondly, because a production site in France would facilitate integration into the French economic market.The factory, built in 1961 in the industrial area of the Alsatian city, initially comprised a production hall and an administration and service room building. The rapid development of the company enabled a subsequent expansion of the facilities. Today there are nine buildings with a built-up area of 148,000 m² on a total area of 34.5 ha.The current product range of Liebherr-France SAS includes around 30 crawler excavator models, from the R 914 Compact to the R 980 SME, for use in earthworks and quarries. Production also includes electric excavators and a range of special equipment for specific tasks such as demolition, material handling, bridge or tunnel applications. The crawler excavators with an operating weight of 14 to 100 tonnes are equipped with Liebherr engines with an output of 90 to 420 kW. In 2022, the production programme will comprise 2,150 machines. This exceptional figure is the result of continuous investment and thus permanent development, which secures the Group's presence in the European, French and Alsatian industrial landscape.Martin Schickel: “yellow blood” since 1977Martin Schickel, the face of Liebherr-France SAS, is retiring after 50 years in the profession and more than 44 years with the group of companies.

The end of an era – the last LR 1600/2 leaves the Liebherr Plant in Ehingen,Press releases |10/29/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-end-of-an-era-the-last-lr-1600-2-leaves-the-liebherr-plant-in-ehingen.html?page=52,"The end of an era after 220 models built – production of one of Liebherr’s most successful crawler cranes is being discontinued. The last LR 1600/2, which was primarily designed and used for wind power jobs, will be delivered at the end of October. Its successor is the LR 1700-1.0, which Liebherr launched in June 2021 and which has already become very popular all over the world as the new standard in the crawler crane segment for wind power.Find out more",Press releases,10/29/2021,"The 600 tonne LR 1600/2 crawler crane is being removed from the Liebherr crawler crane portfolio. 223 of them have been built and delivered to customers over a period of almost 13 years. Its successor has already been launched in the form of the LR 1700-1.0.. LR 1600/2 large volume wind power craneThe LR 1600/2 was originally designed as a crane for wind power and the first one was delivered in summer 2008. In addition to the standard version, a version with narrow crawler track, known as the LR 1600/2-W, was also marketed successfully over a period of ten years. The main feature of this version was the fact that it could travel along narrow crawlers in wind farms considerably more easily than the standard version. The narrow track version accounted for around one-quarter of all these cranes in worldwide use.. Initially, the LR 1600/2 was delivered in its SL4DFB configuration, designed for wind turbines with a hub height of 130 to 135 metres. In this configuration, the crane had a main boom of 138 metres and a fixed jib of 12 metres. This was the benchmark for turbines with a hub height of 135 metres. Over the next few years, however, the size of wind turbines increased dramatically up to hub heights of 150 metres or more. This altered the requirements for the crane which the designers at Liebherr followed closely. The lifting capacities and hoisting heights of the boom systems were continuously modified with the SL10 and SL13 versions, which both became established on the market. These booms enabled the crane to handle wind turbines with hub heights of 150 metres.However, the LR 1600/2 was not just used for wind power, it was also used in industry and for infrastructure projects shortly after the first one was delivered to its customer. Often equipped with a ballast wagon or suspended ballast, the 600 tonne crane impressed users with its lifting capacity. Over the years, Liebherr unveiled more innovations for its crawler crane portfolio, such as the B2 guide and VarioTray for suspended ballast, which eliminates the complicated stacking and unstacking of ballast slabs by simply disconnecting a whole ballast pallet.. Successor standing readyThe final LR 1600/2 will be delivered to van Adrighem based in the Netherlands at the end of October. However, its successor is already on the market in the form of the LR 1700-1.0. The first of these was delivered in June 2021. The new 700 tonne crane meets the new requirements which the LR 1600/2 could no longer satisfy. New wind turbines with hub heights of 165 metres, requiring loads of over 100 tonnes to be hoisted to this height, are challenges to which Liebherr has responded with its new LR 1700-1.0. It is significantly more powerful than its predecessor and in some load cases even comes close to the LR 1750/2.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

An interaction that rules,Press releases |10/28/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/an-interaction-that-rules.html?page=52,"When the right parts work together, the result is success. What sounds like a familiar promise at first, however, applies perfectly to the Liebherr product division of drive technology and slewing bearings. The components of both product areas come directly from Liebherr site in Biberach (Germany). In customer applications, this interaction results in advantages that extend well beyond the respective individual product strengths.Find out more",Press releases,10/28/2021,"Certain things should not be looked at separately from each other. Especially when they have to function together reliably. Drives with gear rims or slewing bearings, for instance, form such a unit. The two Liebherr product areas of drive technology and slewing bearings are located right next door to each other at the Biberach site. The coordination procedures are short, and people know each other. Over the years, the cooperation between these seemingly completely different disciplines has resulted in a knowledge resource that comes to light in direct, personal customer consulting. A perfect symbiosis of these two components in any application represents clear product advantages that cannot be exploited in this way, when viewed separately.Tooth by tooth: a perfect harmony""We check the requirements for the drive and slewing bearing components right from the beginning. Hence, we deliver a pair of drive and rotary element that ideally complements each other in the customer's application,"" explains Stefan Harsch, team leader application engineering from the Liebherr Drive Technology department.In detail, this means that Liebherr drives are manufactured with the necessary profile and flank line modifications on the pinion. If necessary, this can be based on calculation and simulation techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM). They provide important information on the load capacity and gearing reliability and allow Liebherr to optimise the design of its components. This gear fit accuracy means that slewing bearings and drive pinions are perfectly matched to the load spectrum of the respective application. This accuracy is reflected by efficient turning with little backlash, which significantly extends the service life of both components.The same applies to the materials used. The drive pinions and the ring gear of the slewing bearing are given a material composition that is an ideal match. It is neither too hard nor too soft and prevents material cannibalism, in which the components do not wear each other out.Runs like a charmEven the best tooth coordination needs good lubrication. It is not without reason that Liebherr is also regarded as a consulting expert, when it comes to the viscosities of greases and oils. Applying this knowledge, a technically well-matched product combination is created, that is simultaneously lubricated. In such a way failure due to tooth cracking with subsequent tooth breakage or minor metallic material chipping is reduced to a minimum. All factors together add up to a component pair that makes a clear contribution to significantly longer application availability.Innovations from application experienceAt Liebherr, this shared technical understanding of the application also serves as a source for innovation. Not only does Liebherr's own applications benefit from it, but also external companies that use Liebherr components in their machines. One example of a product innovation is Liebherr's patented tooth root safety geometry (TSG). This is a built-in predetermined breaking point above the pinion in the drive. The origin of this design lies precisely in application experience, coupled with foresight: in the event of a sudden overload, the drive should break in a controlled manner at the specified point. This is an additional safety measure in case the overload protection integrated in the drive should no longer be effective. In this way, the significantly more expensive slewing bearing, which takes longer to procure, is protected against tooth breakage and can remain installed in the application. Longer downtimes are therefore being avoided.Less effort, more convenienceAs always, time plays one of the most crucial roles in any project. As a business partner for component pairs, Liebherr stands out in terms of communication and coordination with shorter distances, as well as solutions from a single source. Manufacturing, assembly and modification of the component along with service offers at one location not only minimise effort, but also avoids possible design errors due to the simpler exchange of information and close cooperation.With this cooperation and the resulting experience, Liebherr has already successfully implemented a variety projects..

Jubilee: Excavator marking 60 years of Liebherr in France handed over to the Chavaz Père et Fils company ,Press releases |10/28/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/jubilee-excavator-marking-60-years-of-liebherr-in-france-handed-over-to-the-chavaz-pere-et-fils-company.html?page=52,"An R 960 SME designed in a 1960s “vintage” style was handed over to Chavaz, a customer specialising in quarrying. This special model, produced at Liebherr’s historic site in France, celebrates the brand’s 60 years in the country.Find out more",Press releases,10/28/2021,"The handover of the R 960 SME crawler excavator to our long-standing client Chavaz Père et Fils marks Liebherr’s 60 years in France. At the avenue Joseph Rey in Colmar since 1961, this site is synonymous with local and national expertise in the development and production of the Liebherr Group’s earthmoving crawler excavators for the whole world.. A special design for a jubileeThe 60th anniversary of Liebherr in France is highlighted by the special design of this R 960 SME crawler excavator. With a “vintage” look, the Chavaz Père et Fils crawler excavator sports 1960s. Against a grey background, the retro-modern fusion depicts the philosophy of the Liebherr brand, a company that is innovative while also proud of its origins and roots.Emphatically “Made in France”, this very special 60 tonne machine’s components are painted in the colours of the country where it was manufactured. The excavator’s counterweight, undercarriage and uppercarriage have a blue, white and red trim, as an indispensable and yet subtle celebration of 60 years of French quality.“60” is a key number for this event – referring not only to the weight in tons of the machine and the decade of Liebherr’s arrival in France but also to how many years Liebherr has been in the country. That is why this number appears right in the centre of the excavator, on the counterweight, where it nestles among the French national colours.. A decision of conviction In search of expertise and flawless quality, Chavaz Père et Fils, a company specialising in quarrying, puts its faith in Liebherr. This Liebherr customer based in the Haute-Savoie area carries out multiple activities including pick-up, loading and direct materials extraction. The customer attaches great importance to the innovation and performance of the machine.Chavaz Père et Fils’s choice was no accident. Already the owner of an R 964 having proved itself in over 16,000 hours of use, the customer is making a repeat purchase from Liebherr. The reliability of Liebherr’s products, along with the total package of services offered by the company and its distributor Tecmat convinced.. The SME range for challenging applications Including excavators from 42 to 100 tonnes, the SME range features four specialised models for quarrying applications. All variants have reinforced undercarriages for increased robustness, with integrated components from models higher up the standard range. In the case of the R 960 SME excavator for Chavaz Père et Fils, these components come from the 70 tonne R 966 HD excavator.For quarrying applications and use of the larger-capacity buckets required, SME crawler excavators come equipped with a heavy counterweight. This keeps the machine stable, making it more comfortable for the operator. In line with Liebherr’s philosophy, the excavator’s movement kinematics and special SME cylinders offer more powerful digging and breakout forces that are unrivalled in this machine category on the market.. Chavaz down through the generations Truly a family business, Chavaz began its quarrying activities on the frontier with Switzerland. Initially involved in agriculture, the company branched out into extraction work at the Mont Salève quarries in the mid-1800s.A few hundred years later, the Chavaz brothers’ business presence would span both sides of the frontier. Over time, the company grew to become a major player in quarrying, offering a variety of quarry materials and gravels in the Geneva area.Today, the company is engaged in a variety of sectors that complement each other, such as sale and transport of materials recycled from construction waste, sale and transport of special materials to trade and retail customers, and solutions for managing material excavated during earthmoving and waste from demolition work..

Liebherr ends first half of the year with positive result,Press releases |10/27/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-ends-first-half-of-the-year-with-positive-result.html?page=52,"Following a sharp increase in turnover, incoming orders at the highest level and increasing investments, the Liebherr Group reports a positive performance for the first half of 2021. The company expects that this trend will continue throughout the current year.Find out more",Press releases,10/27/2021,"With a turnover of € 5,616 million as at 30 June 2021, the first half of 2021 was very pleasing for the Liebherr Group. The company achieved an increase in turnover of € 663 million or 13.4% compared to the previous year.Revenues in the Earthmoving, Material Handling Technology, Deep Foundation Machines, Mobile and Crawler Cranes, Tower Cranes, Concrete Technology and Mining product segments grew by over 16% altogether. In the other product segments, including Maritime Cranes, Aerospace and Transportation Systems, Gear Technology and Automation Systems, Refrigeration and Freezing, as well as Components and Hotels, the turnover increased by over 7% as a whole.The regional distribution of turnover shifted in the first half of 2021 towards European and American markets. In some instances, significant revenue increases were achieved there. In many markets in Asia, Africa, as well as the Near and Middle East, the influence of the pandemic on business can still be felt, which is reflected in sales losses.. Positive order situationThe order intake improved considerably in all product segments of the Liebherr Group. Liebherr has never received so many orders within a half year – proof of the high international demand for products and services of the Liebherr Group. Due to the strong demand and the current tense situation in some procurement markets, the current volume of orders on hand of the Liebherr Group is also at a high level.. Investments in location expansionThe investments of the Liebherr Group have also increased substantially. Amongst other things, Liebherr is investing in the expansion of its sites. For example, two large-scale projects are to be realised in the coming years at Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH: Firstly, the new construction of the Repair Centre South Germany in the Berg industrial park in Ehingen (Germany) is planned by 2022; in addition, the new spare parts and shipment warehouse will be in operation by 2024. Secondly, Liebherr in Ehingen wants to extend its factory premises with a green factory by 2030 in order to expand its production capacities for the increasing demand for mobile and crawler cranes.Outside Europe Liebherr has started the construction of a new premises at the Dalian site in China. In doing so, the Liebherr Group is expanding the production of large diameter bearings, gearboxes and hydraulic cylinders for the Chinese market. The production is expected to start at the end of 2022.. Product highlights with focus on alternative drivesAs a technology company, the Liebherr Group pursues the goal of shaping the technological progress in the industries that are important for the company. Across all product segments the engineers in the Liebherr Group work on innovative solutions. Digitalization is one focal point of the development activities, another focal point is new drive technologies for the construction and mining industry, aerospace, rail cars and agricultural machines amongst others. In the area of construction machines the following new products with drive innovations took centre stage at Liebherr in the first half of 2021:. In March, Liebherr launched its new mobile construction crane MK 73-3.1. The power for the compact, electric taxi crane can be supplied from the construction site or by means of an integrated generator.With the R 9600, Liebherr introduced the new generation of hydraulic mining excavators in the same month and sets standards in the area of open-pit mining equipment: The models are available with different drives including an electric drive.The new electric crawler excavators R 976-E and R 980 SME-E also work with zero local emissions. With low-cost maintenance and lower operating costs, the excavators guarantee the familiar high performance and reliability also in extreme conditions.Since this year, the first all-electric truck mixers from Liebherr enable quiet and zero-emission concrete transport. The drum drive developed by Liebherr and ZF comprises a low-maintenance, efficient unit of electric motor and mixer transmission. For the first time the truck and the mixer are powered from the traction battery.The LR 1250.1 unplugged, the first battery-operated crawler crane in the world, which has been available since 2020, received an award: At the ESTA Awards for the crane and heavy equipment industry the Liebherr crane won in the category ""Innovation Manufacturer"". Driven by an electric motor with a system performance of 255 kilowatts and a maximum load bearing capacity of 250 tonnes, the LR 1250.1 unplugged has the same performance as the conventionally driven crane version.. Outlook for the second half of 2021Owing to the positive development of the demand in the first half of 2021, the Liebherr Group currently expects to attain the second highest turnover in the Group's history by the year end and therefore only slightly below the turnover of the year prior to the corona pandemic. A change in the macroeconomic conditions, the difficult situation on the procurement markets or even recent restrictions of business due to the corona pandemic pose risks for the further positive development, whose impacts however remain controllable for 2021..

Unique – Dźwig-Mar takes delivery of the first LTM 1650-8.1 in Poland,Press releases |10/27/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/unique-dzwig-mar-takes-delivery-of-the-first-ltm-1650-8-1-in-poland.html?page=52,"“The LTM 1650-8.1 has a unique design and concept. It is variable and powerful, yet compact”, says Marcin Zielonka, Managing Director at Dźwig-Mar s.c. The Polish crane and heavy haulage contractor took delivery of the first LTM 1650-8.1 mobile crane from Liebherr in Poland. The new crane will upgrade the company’s fleet which consists of over thirty Liebherr cranes.Find out more",Press releases,10/27/2021,"The expansion in the number of wind turbines in Poland continues apace. For Marcin Zielonka and his company Dźwig-Mar s.c. it means: “We have higher demand for large cranes. The 8-axle model will upgrade our fleet to meet the increased demand for cranes in this class. It is now our largest mobile crane.” In addition to the erection of wind turbines, the LTM 1650-8.1 will also carry out hoisting work at heavy industry sites such as refineries.The LTM 1650-8.1 features the very latest technology and is designed to deliver maximum performance together with high flexibility and economy. “This heavy duty crane can handle hoisting work normally reserved for the 700 tonne class effortlessly but has the dimensions of a 500 tonne crane”, says Marcin Zielonka. “In addition, VarioBallast® delivers enormous benefits.” The variable hydraulic adjustment of the ballast radius from 6.4 metres to 8.4 metres saves on ballast transport if there is sufficient space available. It also enables jobs requiring high lifting capacity to be carried out on constricted sites. At the same time, the 8-axle crane is designed to be set up quickly using its smart set-up processes and can also be transported economically.For Dźwig-Mar, which has a workforce of around 50, the LTM 1650-8.1 is one of three new cranes in 2021 – the company has already modernised its fleet by investing in an LTM 1130-5.1 and an LTM 1350-6.1. “We buy Liebherr because we have had a good, solid partnership with the company for many years.

Liebherr reaches a new milestone in tunnelling,Press releases |10/25/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-reaches-a-new-milestone-in-tunnelling.html?page=52,"With its main bearing for Shanghai Tunnel Engineering (STEC), a Chinese system provider of tunnel boring machines (TBMs), Liebherr has reached the next dimension in tunnel construction. With the diameter of almost eight metres and the weight of 44 tons, the roller bearing is a real heavyweight to be used in one of the largest tunnel boring machines. At the same time, the bearing is the largest TBM main bearing of its kind produced by Liebherr to date.Find out more",Press releases,10/25/2021,"When a main bearing weighs as much as 44 small cars at once, it is expected to be able to do a lot. Used in the cutter head of a TBM, it helps to bore a tunnel about the height of a six-storey building. This is possible due to its double rollers in the bearing track, an extremely precise internal gearing, as well as due to 20 pinions, that drive the bearing on the inner ring.And that’s not the end of it. In addition to the main bearing, Liebherr also manufactures the erector bearing for the said tunnel-boring machine. With a diameter of 7.3 metres and a weight of 5.7 tons, it may not seem quite as big in comparison, but it still has an important function in tunnel construction. It sits behind the cutter head and ensures that precast concrete elements are placed all around the wall during tunnelling. The concrete elements primarily have the task of securing the tunnel. In the second step, these concrete elements support the TBM, when moving forward.. With a height of 15.5 metres, the eight-kilometre tunnel in the city of Foshan in the south of China will ensure that vehicles can travel back and forth in three lanes on two superimposed roadways. In more and more cities, the infrastructure is being newly developed and expanded. Therefore, the demand for subway construction or road tunnels is growing worldwide. Also tunnel systems for mining, hydro power, as well as supply and disposal systems are currently in great demand, showing strong growth. For Liebherr, the production of the TBM main bearing is hence a step in the right direction.Liebherr has already completed several projects with the STEC company.

Third Liebherr LR 11000 crawler crane delivered to Felbermayr,Press releases |10/22/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/third-liebherr-lr-11000-crawler-crane-delivered-to-felbermayr.html?page=53,"A Liebherr LR 11000 crawler crane in its smart blue livery left the factory in Ehingen in early summer. Its destination – Austria. Its job – wind turbine erection. Its new owner – Felbermayr Holding GmbH. This was the third of these modern 1000 tonne cranes bought by the family run business, which operates throughout Europe. The powerful crawler crane was supplied with all the latest features, including the VarioTray detachable suspended ballast and the V-Frame hydraulically adjustable folding frame. Felbermayr has already placed an order for another large Liebherr crane in the form of an LR 1800-1.0. This will be delivered shortly.Find out more",Press releases,10/22/2021,"Work is currently being carried out in Burgenland, Austria, on repowering an existing wind farm. Old, small wind turbines on the extensive fields on the border with Slovakia are being dismantled to make way for more modern systems. Felbermayr’s brand new Liebherr LR 11000 crawler crane has been working on the new, significantly more powerful wind turbines since July. A total of ten turbines with a rotor diameter of 138 metres and a rating of 4.2 megawatts is to be installed.. The brand new 1000 tonne crane features a 168 metre lattice boom, a derrick boom and an F2 jib, which is ideal for erection work in a wind farm – 15 metres long and slightly angled. It enables the topmost components of the wind turbines, with their massive hub heights of 160 metres, to be installed safely with adequate space to manoeuvre the various components.The heaviest components, and therefore the largest load cases for the LR 11000, are the stator and rotor, which are assembled to make the generator. Installing these parts sees a gross load of around 88 tonnes on the crane hook. A total of 380 tonnes of central, suspended and slewing platform ballast ensure that the crawler crane has adequate stability when handling these loads, a hoist height of 160 metres and a required radius of around 32 metres. A further 450 tonnes of ballast is available on site. However, this reserve is only required to raise and lower the massive lattice boom and can be pinned to the suspended ballast pallet in just a few minutes.. Just six days required to relocate to a new site When the weather plays ball, the crane team and assembly team can erect a wind turbine on the existing 85 metre tower in around four days. The LR 11000 is then dismantled and transported to the next site in the wind farm. Liebherr continually works on developing the handling procedures for setting up its crawler cranes, and this is clearly shown when relocating the 1000 tonne crawler crane – only around six days are required after installing the final rotor blade until the crawler crane is fully set off again and ready to start work at the new site.. The Liebherr LR 11000 has become an essential tool for Felbermayr both for jobs at wind farms and for work in industry. It is the most powerful lifting equipment in the company’s impressively large crane fleet. One of the very first of these cranes to be made was delivered to the Austrian group in summer 2014. In addition, the double “Power Boom”, which boosts lifting capacity, was also installed for the very first time on a blue LR 11000 operated by Felbermayr. At the time, a nacelle around 200 tonnes was hanging on the hook and the crawler crane managed to install what at the time was one of the largest rotor stars in the world with a diameter of 152 metres in a single hoist.Heavy loads, mega transports, massive infrastructure and special projects – all these and more are part of the portfolio of the Felbermayr Group whose cranes and machines can often be seen in Austria with the striking blue livery. The company has expanded massively, above all in the states of Austria, over the last 30 years. Family-run Felbermayr now has a total of 72 sites in 19 countries around Europe..

Modern Liebherr mixing plant of type Betomix 2.5 in operation in Berlin,Press releases |10/18/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/modern-liebherr-mixing-plant-of-type-betomix-2-5-in-operation-in-berlin.html?page=53,A new Betomix 2.5 mixing plant from Liebherr has been in operation for Heidelberger Beton GmbH since summer 2020. The plant is equipped to the highest safety standards. The ready-mixed concrete plant supplies quality concrete to the Berlin region.Find out more,Press releases,10/18/2021,"The ultra-modern and well-equipped Betomix 2.5 further expands the ready-mixed concrete services of Heidelberger Beton GmbH in Berlin. The mixing plant delivers up to 115 m³ output per hour with its proven DW 2.5 twin-shaft mixer. The automatic high pressure cleaning system cleans the mixer and collecting funnel largely automatically, whereby the daily manual cleaning times are reduced to a minimum. Plenty of space on the mixer platform and generous platforms and walkways make all areas of the plant easily accessible.Galvanised steel constructionThe entire steel structure of the mixer and weigher platform, the skip elevator and the weighing belt have been hot-dip galvanised for a long service life. The latest generation of the Betomix horizontal mixing plant series has been successfully established worldwide for many years, thanks to its modular concept. This design facilitates numerous variants in accordance with customer requirements and equipment, such as the bucket elevator for feeding.Storage for aggregates and cementThe inline silo with seven chambers holds around 350 m³ of aggregates; four of the seven chambers are divided. A recessed charging hopper allows the sand and gravel delivery to be tipped out at ground level by dump trucks; a wheel loader is not required. A bucket elevator transports the materials upwards onto a reversing belt for feeding the chambers. Four of the chambers are equipped with the Litronic FMS moisture measurement sensors developed by Liebherr; the sand moisture levels are measured up to 40 times per second.Six cement silos with a total cement store volume of 600 tonnes are available for cement storage. By dividing two silos, it is possible to store a total of eight types of binding agents. During winter operation, a heating system conducts warm air into the aggregate silos. This guarantees operation during the cold season.High safety standardsHeidelberger Beton GmbH placed great importance on the issue of safety when planning the plant. Through additional characteristics, it was possible to enhance the safety standards even further: For example, all walkways were designed with a width of 800 millimetres instead of 600 mm and were realised in slip resistance class R11. Heidelberger Beton GmbH paid particular attention to emergency exit, rescue and escape routes. The plant design includes no ladders for ascending and descending; instead, all areas up to the top of the cement silos are accessible via stairs. All pneumatic components that pose a risk of crushing are safeguarded during maintenance work by lockable ball valves. Electric drives are protected by lockable inspection switches.The plant is secured with a transfer key locking system. In this way, all maintenance points that pose a potential risk include a consistent process of unlocking and locking before maintenance work is possible to deliver maximum hazard reduction. Accessing these areas during plant operation would be life-threatening.Mixing plant with a wide range of equipmentThe entire mixing plant is equipped with extensive accessories. These include video surveillance systems for monitoring in various areas, a traffic light system on the silo chambers for the levels and vibrators on the silo walls. Air dispersion receptacles are used for material with poor sliding characteristics. The accessories are completed by a 60 millimetre insulating lining for the plant and dust filter systems..

MAHLE Powertrain collaborates with Liebherr to co-develop active pre-chamber technology for heavy-duty hydrogen-fuelled engines,Press releases |10/14/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/mahle-powertrain-collaborates-with-liebherr-to-co-develop-active-pre-chamber-technology-for-heavy-duty-hydrogen-fuelled-engines.html?page=53,"Liebherr Machines Bulle SA has announced early trial results using MAHLE Jet Ignition (MJI) in the development of hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines. It proved to be a successful ignition source for hydrogen without the need to reduce compression ratios, unlocking the potential of hydrogen as a carbon-neutral fuel for the heavy-duty engine sector.Find out more",Press releases,10/14/2021,"“The use of hydrogen as a combustion fuel has the potential for rapid de-carbonisation of many heavy-duty and off-road sectors,” says Mike Bunce, Head of Research for MAHLE Powertrain US. “A wealth of research over the past few decades has confirmed the compatibility of hydrogen with internal combustion engines. The challenge has been to get it to run with stable combustion without resorting to reductions in compression ratios to avoid engine knock and pre-ignition. Our common work with Liebherr suggests we have the answer.”Hydrogen is a carbon-neutral fuel that is gaining renewed attention due to its increasing availability and the fact that it can be produced from renewable energy sources. As a fuel for proven and existing ICE technology in aggressive environments, hydrogen is ideally suited to the high load duty cycles with sudden load steps, heat, dust and vibration of heavy duty and off-road use. This is not the case for battery electric or fuel-cell powertrains.. The challenge is that hydrogen as a combustion fuel is highly prone to abnormal combustion, leading to engine knock and pre-ignition. Typically, this necessitates an inefficient reduction in engine compression ratio. However, a potential alternative is to depress combustion temperatures by using high levels of dilution, which is more conducive to stable running, but would require a high-energy ignition source. Originally developed for gasoline applications, MAHLE’s pre-chamber ignition technology enables the use of highly dilute fuel/ air mixtures, making it ideal for use in hydrogen-fuelled engines. To achieve this, the MJI was adapted, mainly by modifying the pre-chamber in the cylinder head containing a spark plug, which ignites a fuel/ air mixture. The resulting gas plasma is forced through small orifices into the main combustion chamber to ignite the combustion mixture very quickly and uniformly.Adaptation of the active pre-chamber to fit in Liebherr’s H966 and H964 engines has shown, in a preliminary investigation, that this technology extends the stable dilution limit of the engine well beyond the capability of traditional ignition systems, with much more rapid and complete combustion.“Together with Liebherr Machines Bulle SA, we have been able to tailor the active pre-chamber technology to the Liebherr heavy-duty engines, which leads to improving the combustion speed, performance and emission. Additionally, the technology will simplify the hardware architecture of the engines,” explains Mike Bunce. “This has enabled us to mitigate the compression ratio de-rating risk associated with hydrogen, as well as reduce the fuel consumption. The expertise of Liebherr’s engineering teams in the areas of heavy-duty combustion and alternative fuels research have both been major assets in this program,” adds Bouzid Seba, Head of Predevelopment at Liebherr Machines Bulle, pointing out Liebherr’s openness to technology and the Group’s pursuit of different approaches to energy conversion as well as suitable fuels.Some of the collaboration results to date were jointly presented at the 8th International Engine Congress in February 2021. The two companies are continuing their collaboration in order to push towards zero emissions vehicles that can meet the significant demands of the heavy-duty and off-road sectors..

From site to site: The new MK 73-3.1 from Liebherr in action,Press releases |10/13/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/from-site-to-site-the-new-mk-73-3-1-from-liebherr-in-action.html?page=53,"Short setup times, high-performance lifting – the new Liebherr MK 73-3.1 mobile construction crane proves its worth as a compact taxi crane for everyday construction site use. It can handle multiple jobs in different locations on the same day without any difficulty, and is able to reach construction sites in densely built-up areas with ease. Customers are particularly impressed by its smart assistance systems and hybrid power concept.Find out more",Press releases,10/13/2021,"The smallest of Liebherr’s mobile construction cranes excels on tight construction sites. Whether it’s a densely built-up residential or inner-city area, the MK 73-3.1 reaches its work sites with ease. Measuring 13.80 metres in overall length, 2.75 metres in width and 4.0 metres in height, it offers excellent manoeuvrability. Although it is compact in form, customers don’t have to make any compromises as it includes all the features of its big brother, the MK 88-4.1.The mobile construction crane is particularly well suited to smaller construction sites and short assignments as has been impressively proven in the Netherlands. In Haarlem, very near to Amsterdam, the MK 73-3.1 helped to bring a historic building back to life. More than 70 new flats are being created in the densely built-up city centre following the relocation of the district court there. It was the crane’s task to lift insulated roof sheeting. The MK was able to be positioned in close proximity; the projecting edges of the angular building didn’t pose a problem.. Smart assistance systemsRestricted space on site, tight access routes and the need for the lowest possible environmental impact were all challenges that crane rental company Koninklijke Saan B.V. overcame thanks tothe MK 73-3.1. “The crane is really compact and I like the fact that I can also operate it using site power,” says Tim Hoekstra (Koninklijke Saan B.V), who drove and operated the mobile construction crane that day. “For tight locations like here in Haarlem and Amsterdam, where I work a lot, the variable support widths are ideal for assembly.” The MK also features smart assistance systems such as Load Plus and level luffing in luffed positions.The rental company Koninklijke Saan B.V. is deploying the new mobile construction crane in inner-city areas with great success. Customers are impressed by its compact dimensions, long reach and substantial capacity. The MK 73-3.1 can also be operated electrically on site or powered by its integrated drive unit. Operation is extremely quiet and emission-free in electric mode. This all provides great added value for Koninklijke Saan B.V.; more and more customers are discovering and requesting the crane.. Easy assembly, quick change of locationSome 50 kilometres to the south-west, another Liebherr MK 73-3.1 had a job to do. In the Hague, or to be more precise in the Voorburg district, it was responsible for moving painting platforms weighing around 800 kilograms. The mobile construction crane offers lifting capacities of up to 2,000 kilograms at maximum radius, whereby this can be increased to up to 2,800 kilograms depending on the luffed position.The parts to be moved were located at a height of 20 metres on the roof of a residential building and needed to be moved back a further 30 metres. The painting platforms couldn’t be seen from the ground, but this wasn’t a problem thanks to the MK 73-3.1’s infinitely adjustable elevating cabin. Modern camera systems supported the crane operator during the lifts. He described visibility as excellent due to the assistance systems making sure that both load and undercarriage were always in sight.The mobile construction crane, which is part of the fleet belonging to crane company Nederhoff B.V., worked on the site for roughly a day. It is designed for one-man operation and is ready to lift in around ten minutes. Further transport vehicles aren’t required. Thanks to the taxi crane concept, multiple jobs at different locations are easily possible on the same day.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Elephant rescue in the River Wupper – LTF 1045-4.1 hoists Tuffi back onto her plinth ,Press releases |10/12/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/elephant-rescue-in-the-river-wupper-ltf-1045-4-1-hoists-tuffi-back-onto-her-plinth.html?page=53,The “Tuffi” elephant sturgeon stone has been back on its plinth since the end of September. The floods in July had torn the sculpture out of its anchoring in the River Wupper. Wilden Kran-Vermietung GmbH supported the rescue action using a Liebherr LTF 1045-4.1 truck mounted telescopic crane. It hoisted the artwork weighing 3.5 tonne and measuring 1.8 metres in height out of the water and put back in its original position in the river below the Wuppertal suspension railway.Find out more,Press releases,10/12/2021,"Since 2019, there have been several odd-looking, immobile figures in the River Wupper. Sturgeon stones designed by various artists decorate the renaturated River Wupper to remind everybody, at least in part, of the town’s history. Above all, however, they have a practical purpose as they help the river’s own dynamic, support oxygen enrichment and also catch dead wood. The idea was initiated by the Verein Neue Ufer Wuppertal (Wuppertal New Riverbank Association). It started in April 2019 with “Lucky the Salmon”, to remind people of the successful restoration of the once dead industrial river into a living waterway full of fish. This was followed in 2020 by “Tuffi the Elephant” and “Bobby the Beaver”.. The Tuffi artwork was positioned in the River Wupper in the approximate position where a four-year old elephant once landed. Tuffi was travelling in the Wuppertal suspension railway for publicity purposes for a circus on a normal scheduled trip on 21 July 1950. In a panic she broke through the external wall of the cabin, jumped down ten metres and landed unharmed on her rear end in a mud pool in the Wupper.. During the serious Wupper floods in July, the sculpture was carried several metres downstream. It was probably levered out of position by a tree trunk. After a search lasting several days, Tuffi was discovered, fortunately almost unscathed. The boreholes in the plinth were rinsed out using a drain cleaning truck from the Wuppertal municipal works department. Stainless steel pins were then inserted into them so that Tuffi could be hoisted back onto the plinth.. Kranverleih Wilden provided assistance with this work as the company had spontaneously offered its assistance to the New Riverbank Association immediately after the floods. The work took place shortly after midnight and finished on schedule before 5 o’clock so as not to interfere with traffic on the suspension railway. Using a Liebherr LTF 1045-4.1 truck mounted telescopic crane, the members of the rescue team hoisted the sculpture and returned it to its original position in the river. The time had been selected for safety reasons because the suspension railway travels directly above the River Wupper. It meant that the power in the rails above where the crane was operating could be switched off whilst the suspension railway was not operating. To provide Tuffi with greater protection in the future, the LTF 1045-4.1 inserted several quarry stones upstream in the river to reduce the water pressure on the sculpture..

New York: Liebherr 125 K crane erects eight-storey residential building,Press releases |10/11/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-york-liebherr-125-k-crane-erects-eight-storey-residential-building.html?page=54,"Maximum reach, an external cab and a special paint finish: The American customer Extreme Construction Inc. has opted for the Liebherr 125 K crane for the construction of an apartment building near New York. It’s the largest fast-erecting crane in its class and has been specifically designed for residential, industrial and road construction purposes.Find out more",Press releases,10/11/2021,"A new Liebherr 125 K fast-erecting crane with special paint finish is working on the construction of an eight-storey residential building in the New York metropolitan area. This is its first assignment. “We bought the crane expressly for this purpose,” says Liebherr customer Daniel Bossi, managing director of Extreme Construction Inc, based in Hamilton, New Jersey. It was the reach, usability and flexibility of the Liebherr K series that won over Daniel Bossi and his crane operator.The set-up on site is unusual in that assembly engineers didn’t erect the 125 K on the ground but on the third floor of the building instead. This means there is no need for a recess in the floors of the podium to accommodate the tower of the crane, which saves both time and money. Plus, the 125 K is high enough to be able to rotate above a neighbouring crane without any problems. A Liebherr 316 EC-H is currently working on a different project on a site nearby. Due to its higher position, the 125 K towers over the 316 EC-H by almost seven metres.. No time-consuming relocationsLifting concrete components and placing structures made of steel are just two of the tasks performed by the 125 K on the “25 Maple Avenue” development project in New Rochelle, New York. This project entails an eight-storey building with more than 180 residential units, around 1,900 square metres of commercial space and a multi-storey car park. Extreme Construction Inc. is responsible for the structural and interior work. The project is scheduled for completion in 2022.The 125 K is positioned on the third floor in such a way that all areas of the site are reachable. As a result, time-intensive relocations are not required. Unlike with other types of lifting technology, such as loading or telescopic cranes, there is no need to plan extra routes and parking areas. Given the limited space on the construction site, this is a decisive argument in favour of the fast-erecting crane.. Heaviest lift is 4,000 kilogramsThe crane has a jib length of 55 metres and a maximum lifting capacity of 8,000 kilograms. The hook height for this particular site is just under 37 metres. “Using this crane allows to perform all the required lifting on site. The heaviest lift has been around 4,000 kilograms,” says Daniel Bossi. The auxiliary crane, a Liebherr LTM 1350 mobile crane, lifted the folded 125 K to the third floor and will also bring it down again once the project is complete.“My crane operator Jeff Allen, who has been doing this job since 1984 and has worked for our company since 2008, says that this is the best tower crane he has ever worked with,” reports Daniel Bossi. “We used the Load Plus assistance system for the duration of the job.” With Load Plus, the lifting load can be increased by up to 20 percent at the push of a button. This further increases the performance of the most powerful fast-erecting crane on the market. The external cabin and the support provided by other assistance systems of the Litronic control system also ensure safety on the construction site.. Special paint finish in black and orangeIncidentally, it was crane operator Jeff Allen who brought the Liebherr model to his boss’s attention. Jeff Allen discovered the 125 K at the CONEXPO-CON/AGG in Las Vegas last year and found himself immediately impressed. Daniel Bossi subsequently ordered the crane in black and orange, Extreme Construction Inc’s company colours, inclusive of an external cab.The cabin can be assembled without the need for additional tools. This also applies to the crane itself. Thanks to the low-maintenance rope kinematics, the crane unfolds with the support of its own drives. The 125 K is the largest of Liebherr’s K series. A well-designed assembly process, and numerous options for hook height and jib length adjustment, make site planning easier. Optimised external dimensions ensure that the K cranes fit into almost any gap. Other customers in the US are also attracted by this; the 125 K is now available from several American rental companies.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Three new Liebherr Megamax STS for Maher Terminals LLC,Press releases |10/05/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/three-new-liebherr-megamax-sts-for-maher-terminals-llc.html?page=54,Liebherr Container Cranes have been awarded the contract for the supply of three ship to shore (STS) container cranes for Maher Terminals LLC at the Port of New York & New Jersey. The cranes will take their place alongside the existing eight Liebherr STS cranes at Maher’s terminal. The first two cranes were supplied in 2012 with a further two in 2014 and four in 2016. Maher’s positive experience with the Liebherr STS for the best part of a decade has reinforced the decision to once again purchase Liebherr cranes.Find out more,Press releases,10/05/2021,"With a span of 30.48 m, a back reach of 22.9 m, an outreach of 69.5 m and a lift height over rail of 53.34 m, the megamax cranes are designed to handle the world’s largest container vessels.Green machinesMaher is a champion of Sustainable Port Infrastructure and the Liebherr STS cranes are a key component of Maher’s comprehensive energy and environmental management programme.

Turn two into three,Press releases |10/05/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/turn-two-into-three.html?page=54,"Uruguayan company Corporación Navios replaced a Liebherr long duty cycle crane with a permanently installed harbour crane type FCC 300. The recently erected harbour crane will be used for dry bulk handling of barges in hoppers at the terminal in Nueva Palmira, Uruguay. The now total of three harbour cranes is expected to increase the terminal's handling rates and generate operating synergies, as the crane operators will work with the same type of crane on all operations.Find out more",Press releases,10/05/2021,"Corporación Navios has been working with Liebherr cranes for 30 years. The Liebherr products are used to handle bulk cargo on the narrow pier. For terminals with little space but a high workload, the space-saving design of the Fixed Cargo Cranes series by Liebherr is the perfect solution. This has been demonstrated over the past six years: Between 600 and 700 tonnes of iron were handled per hour throughout this time. They were supported by a Liebherr HS 871 HD long duty cycle crane, which is now being replaced by a FCC 300, the third of its kind at the terminal. With over 100,000 operating hours, the long duty cycle crane is a symbol for the successful and reliable cooperation between Corporación Navios and Liebherr. In the course of this, the customer's renewed decision in favour of a Liebherr maritime crane is a sign of trust.Outstanding experience values as the basis for the renewed purchase decision„With the investment in another FCC 300, we are taking a decisive step towards higher turnover rates“, says Rosina Lurato, Project and Certification Manager of Corporación Navios, “we handle around five million tonnes of dry cargo per year and need fast as well as reliable equipment. Based on our positive experience with the two permanently installed cargo cranes, it was quickly clear to us that another crane of the same type was the right choice.""About half of the five million tonnes are exported from Uruguay, the other half is imported dry cargo from other countries. The FCCs handle various grains such as soy, maize and wheat, as well as minerals such as iron and manganese. The new FCC 300 is mainly used for soy handling and can handle up to 1,000 tonnes of soy per hour. The soy from Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil is loaded onto overseas ships at the terminal and transported to Europe, Africa and the Far East.. Space-saving design and use of synergy effectsIn addition, to the space-saving design, the higher handling capacity was also a decisive feature for choosing the third permanently installed harbour crane. Furthermore, the higher flexibility due to the interchangeability of the grabs played an important role. With the two FCCs already in place, the crane operators now always work with the same type of equipment. This increases safety during operations and facilitates routine operation. Another advantage of the identical cranes is a more efficient maintenance and procurement of spare parts. All three units can be maintained in one service loop. Also, the Liebherr engineers from Argentina can train and specialise the customer's maintenance personnel on the FCC 300. This enables them to check certain aspects of the crane’s everyday operations independently. In case of urgent service needs by the customer, the Liebherr specialists can be on-site in just two hours.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Crane fleet expansion – Baumann takes delivery of Liebherr LTM 1150-5.3 mobile crane ,Press releases |09/28/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/crane-fleet-expansion-baumann-takes-delivery-of-liebherr-ltm-1150-5-3-mobile-crane.html?page=54,Viktor Baumann GmbH & Co. KG from Bornheim has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1150 5.3 mobile crane. The crane and heavy haulage contractor from the south of North Rhine Westphalia intends to use the 150 tonne machine to expand its range of services with 5-axle cranes. The compact dimensions of the LTM 1150-5.3 and its 66 metre telescopic boom were the main criteria behind the decision to buy it.Find out more,Press releases,09/28/2021,"“We wanted to close the gap between 130 and 200 tonnes of lifting capacity in our fleet”, explains Sabine Baumann-Duvenbeck. The Managing Director of Viktor Baumann GmbH & Co. KG is delighted with the decision to buy a 150 tonne mobile crane: “With its 66 metre telescopic boom, the LTM 1150-5.3 has a very long mast with good lifting capacity values, yet is also very compact.”Long, powerful telescopic boomLiebherr first unveiled the new LTM 1150-5.3 to the public in autumn last year as the successor to the LTM 1130-5.1, around 1500 of which had been built. The telescopic boom on the new crane is six metres longer than the one on its predecessor. At the same length of 60 metres, the new 5-axle crane can hoist twelve tonnes when fully raised – 1.5 tonnes more than its predecessor. When fully extended to 66 metres, the new crane has a lifting capacity of over nine tonnes. That makes it perfect for erecting tower cranes and radio masts. Lattice extensions enables the new 150-tonne crane to achieve hook heights of up to 92 metres and radii of up to 72 metres.As a result of its long boom, Baumann is planning to use the new LTM 1150-5.3 for erecting and dismantling construction cranes and for jobs in chemical plants where high hoisting heights are required.Despite the average 15 percent higher performance, the Liebherr engineers managed to match the low gross weight of the predecessor crane – with an axle load of twelve tonnes, the new LTM 1150-5.3 can carry nine tonnes of ballast on public roads. Sabine Baumann-Duvenbeck continues: “That makes the LTM 1150-5.3 ideal for versatile, flexible use. The new crane also features some fantastic technical equipment such as ECOmode and ECOdrive to save on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions and also to reduce noise.”Viktor Baumann GmbH & Co. KG has 130 years of experience in heavy haulage, crane operations and assembly work. The company currently employs around 120 staff and operates 26 cranes, 24 of which were supplied by Liebherr..

“Blue Beast” makes its debut – first Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 for ALL Erection & Crane Rental ,Press releases |09/23/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/blue-beast-makes-its-debut-first-liebherr-ltm-1650-8-1-for-all-erection-and-crane-rental.html?page=55,"The newly delivered LTM 1650-8.1, called the “Blue Beast” performed its first lift for ALL Erection & Crane Rental. Delivering an outstanding performance at the first job site, the equipment specialist from ALL is looking forward to the upcoming jobs with the new 700 t ( 770 US-t) crane.Find out more",Press releases,09/23/2021,"The “Blue Beast"", an all-terrain crane with the industry’s largest lifting capacity on eight axles, made its debut recently on a project at a Veterans Administration Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The newly delivered Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1, dubbed the “Blue Beast” due to its cobalt blue paint job, performed its inaugural lift for ALL Erection & Crane Rental, the flagship branch of the ALL Family of Companies.Introduced at Bauma, the world’s leading construction machinery trade fair in 2019, the LTM 1650-8.1 is Liebherr’s successor to the LTM 1500-8.1, the best-selling large crane ever. It ups the ante with a 700 t (770 US-t) capacity, exceeding its predecessor’s capacity by between 15 and 50 percent, depending on the equipment package selected. Units are made-to-order, with ALL placing its order very early enabling a delivery in the second quarter of 2021.. Perfect capacity for the jobThe job at the VA hospital involved construction of a mechanical room and lifting six air handler sections. The crane was set up on the street and had to lift over another building to reach the work area. Its capacity was perfect for the job. “Given where we had to set up the crane, higher-capacity machines wouldn’t have fit, and cranes small enough to fit couldn’t lift the necessary weight at that distance,” said Brian Meek, equipment specialist for ALL Crane.One of the hallmarks of the LTM 1650-8.1’s design is its ability to set up close to buildings and obstructions while safely maintaining its swing, going where possibly no All Terrain crane of its size could ever go before. Beside other features, this is also offered by the VarioBallast® system, which provides high performance with a smaller ballast radius. Ballast radius can be infinitely adjusted between 6,4 and 8,4 m (21 and 27.5 ft) using a simple hydraulic slewing mechanism.In tight spaces, even with its back literally against a wall, it will still handle significant picks. It gives plant and facility managers a new way of thinking about how they maintain equipment and where they can install bigger pieces of equipment.The LTM 1650-8.1 also has two telescopic boom lengths 54 or 80 m (177 or 263 ft) with an easy change system, adding great flexibility. The long boom system is available when needed, and the short one reduces transport costs and setup time. The long boom configuration is also ideal for long-reach, up-and-over applications, providing additional luffing jib strength – just like conditions encountered in the inaugural job.. Convincing right from the start In this instance, 22 m (73 ft) of main boom included 87 m (287 ft) of luffing jib. It could easily handle the 7 t (17,000-pound) air handler sections, each 9 m (30 ft) long. The operator picked each section from a flatbed parked on the street, lifted and swung over the interceding building, and set each piece atop the target structure behind it.“This lift is a perfect showcase for the capabilities of the LTM 1650-8.1,” said Meek. “It has the footprint of a 500 t crane and packs the punch of a 700 t crane. I’ve never seen a large crane built this efficiently. Its assembly is much smoother than even a typical 600 t crane, which will save money on set-up for customers in the long run. I’m excited to see what doors this crane will open to new kinds of jobs.”. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

LiCAS passes test successfully,Press releases |09/21/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/licas-passes-test-successfully.html?page=55,"A consortium consisting of Liebherr-Transportation Systems, Newcastle University and Grand Central has developed an active radial steering suspension system called “LiCAS” (Liebherr Controlled Axle Steering) that has successfully concluded its initial field test phase: the system reduces the wear of tracks and wheels considerably. The project was funded by the Rail Safety and Standards Board UK within the vehicle dynamics competition for innovation funds.Find out more",Press releases,09/21/2021,"Liebherr-Transportation Systems, in association with their consortium partners, the UK rail company Grand Central (part of Arriva Group) and NewRail (Centre for Railway Research at Newcastle University), conducted the initial testing of the LiCAS demonstrator. The aim was to demonstrate that LiCAS could protect the infrastructure, i.e. that wear of track and wheels can be significantly reduced compared to that of conventional suspension systems. Rail transport operators can thus save money on track fees per kilometer (such as those charged in Switzerland and in the UK), as well as on operating and maintenance costs, as the maintenance intervals of wheels can be extended.A BT10 bogie on a Mark 3 coach from Grand Central was equipped with the active radial steering system. The test runs on the 18 mile Weardale Railway, in the UK, fully confirmed the expected positive impact of LiCAS on the behaviour of the bogie, as it was previously determined by multi-body modelling and simulation work.In particular, it has been demonstrated that LiCAS considerably reduces the so-called “angle of attack”, even in the narrowest of curves. This means that wear of the wheel and rail would be significantly reduced in the relevant curves with low radii, and sections of railway with switches and crossings undergo significantly less mechanical stress. The simulations and test results showed that, depending on the curve radius, the contact patch frictional energy, Tγ, which is a relevant wear indicator, is reduced by at least 50 % on bogies equipped with the active radial suspension system. This means that, in addition to protecting the infrastructure, the wheelset maintenance intervals can be extended by up to 30 % and, depending on regulation for specific railway networks in each country, a significant reduction in fees per kilometre travelled can be attained.The core of LiCAS is a compact, hydraulic actuator that has the same size and shape as a conventional swing arm bush and can therefore be integrated in many bogies currently in use. In addition, one hydraulic supply unit with integrated electronics per bogie is required for the system.“In comparison to any passive control system available today, our active system is much more effective, since it can be optimally adapted to the individual curve radius and the different regional track-wheel geometry of the tracks”, explains Paul Hofbauer, Product Manager Hydraulics at Liebherr-Transportation Systems..

SAB purchases Liebherr wheel loaders and crawler excavator,Press releases |09/16/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/sab-purchases-liebherr-wheel-loaders-and-crawler-excavator.html?page=55,"Since its foundation in 1985, SAB has invested in more than 50 Liebherr machines. New Liebherr XPower wheel loaders and an R 945 G8 are the most recent additions. The SAB machines are in operation for an average of 1,500 to 2,000 hours per year in three different quarries. Production covers a quarter of the demand in the French département of Hautes-Alpes.Find out more",Press releases,09/16/2021,"“Choosing Liebherr is a decision for reliability and for the regular technical developments that meet our needs”, explains SAB Director Lionel Para. “We have a very good personal relationship with both Liebherr and its sales partner Ets PIC”, he adds. The origin of Liebherr machines is also an argument for SAB: “Buying machines made in Europe and even in France is an important signal at this time when we need to support our industries in an increasingly uncertain and globalised economic environment.“. XPower wheel loader - Easy to operate and comfortableSAB's Liebherr fleet includes nine wheel loaders, of which seven XPower models were recently delivered. The XPower series is highly appreciated by Lionel Para for its ease of use and low fuel consumption. The XPower wheel loaders are characterised by higher engine power and thus achieve better acceleration and speed values. The hydraulic system and working equipment have also been improved so that higher breakaway forces can be achieved. The cab of the XPower wheel loaders offers full all-round visibility, is air-conditioned and features an adjustable 9-inch touchscreen and optional joystick steering to create a safe and comfortable working environment. Servicing the XPower wheel loaders via the service access points is efficient, simple, quick and extremely safe thanks to non-slip areas and stable ramps in the access area.. Liebherr crawler excavators - A powerful and economical toolThe latest Liebherr crawler excavator in SAB's fleet is an R 945 G8, which is manufactured in Colmar, France. The fleet also includes an R 974 and an R 950 SME, also from Colmar. The main strengths of the Generation 8 are the higher engine power, the heavy counterweight, which allows higher bucket capacities, and the lower fuel consumption. Other innovations are the boom concept with modified head for better boom forces and the optimized load curve, which leads to fuel savings.Result: SAB’s R 945 G8 consumes only 18 litres per hour. All Liebherr Generation 8 engines meet the environmental requirements of exhaust gas Stage V.. The operating behaviour of the R 945 G8 has been optimised: Its manoeuvrability and comfortable cab make it the ideal machine for SAB operations. The Generation 6 R 950 SME model also fully meets the challenges of quarry use. Liebherr crawler excavators in the SME series are fitted with the counterweights of the next higher model in the standard series. This increases their stability and allows the use of larger buckets. Thanks to special cylinders, the machine generates exceptional tearing and digging forces, which improves the performance and economy of SME excavators.. SAB - A family-run partner companyFounded in 1985 in La Roche-des-Arnauds in the Hautes-Alpes département, the quarrying company SAB currently has 15 Liebherr machines in its fleet: nine wheel loaders, five excavators and one bulldozer.

Powerful start: New crawler crane from Liebherr is here,Press releases |09/16/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/powerful-start-new-crawler-crane-from-liebherr-is-here.html?page=55,"Time for something new! With the LR 1700-1.0, the Liebherr factory in Ehingen is bringing a worthy successor to the successful LR 1600/2 and the result of its latest developments in innovative crawler crane technology onto the market. A highly efficient powerhouse is coming to construction sites. The first of these are two machines – delivered recently to the German crane companies Hofmann (Paderborn) and Wasel (Bergheim near Cologne).Find out more",Press releases,09/16/2021,"The new Liebherr LR 1700 1.0 crawler crane is gaining momentum. The first jobs deploying the state-of-the-art powerhouse from Ehingen have been completed with tremendous success. The 700-tonne crawler crane recently fulfilled the high expectations placed in it at its première in a wind farm near Paderborn. The local crane company Hofmann Kran-Vermietung GmbH & Co KG, a subsidiary of the Bracht Group, used the crane to erect a Nordex Delta 4000 wind turbine. The LR 1700-1.0 masterfully dealt with the prefabricated 96-metre high concrete tower for the turbine with a hub height of 164 metres. The heaviest components were the nacelle and drive train with gross loads of 72 and 75 tonnes.. Heavy boom allows higher wind loadsAt the “Holzhausen” wind farm, about 20 kilometres east of Paderborn, the LR 1700-1.0 was equipped with a 165-metre-long main boom. This includes nine lattice boom sections of the somewhat wider H Version (""Heavy""), each twelve metres long. “The H-Boom lets us operate under higher wind loads”, explains crane operator Christoph Bergmaier. The greater wind tolerance of this boom configuration can save the crane and assembly teams on site many a stoppage due to excessive wind. Liebherr allows wind speeds of 11.2 metres per second for the LR 1700-1.0 – as for all current LR crane types with special wind power equipment configurations. With only a minimally reduced maximum load, this value even increases to 13.4 metres per second. This is an invaluable advantage for customers and end users, because normally the wind stops at nine metres per second.. Hofmann's new LR 1700-1.0 comes with all the innovations of Liebherr's crawler crane development from recent years – and has other time-saving features too. “The VarioTray divisible derrick ballast and V-Frame allow us to work with 60 tonnes of derrick ballast during the entire assembly of the turbine – so we don’t have to carry out any time-consuming ballasting”, Christoph Bergmaier is pleased to say. The large ballast pallet is only docked for erecting or taking down the lattice boom – which, by the way, can be erected to an impressive length of 198 metres. A procedure taking about ten minutes with just four bolts – and a total of 375 tonnes of counterweight is already hanging from the derrick boom.. “Really user-friendly crane”The continuously adjustable V-frame ballast radius enabled the blue-painted Hofmann crane to operate in relatively little space on the construction site near Paderborn – even during the slewing process. For the assembly of the wind turbine components, the two drivers then steered their crawler crane close to the tower – with a radius of 26 metres, all components were assembled. Even the heaviest loads on the hook, the 72-tonne nacelle and the three-tonne drive train, were handled without any problems. “The crane can be operated very smoothly and effectively even with heavy loads at height,” reports Christoph Bergmaier, who takes turns with Stephan Dickel at the controls of the Liebherr crane. His succinct conclusion after the first job with the new LR 1700-1.0 at the wind farm: “Powerful crane and really user-friendly!”.

As a result of the project, both companies will be equipped to support mine operators that have a goal to significantly increase electrification of their operations. The collaborative efforts from Liebherr and ABB will improve both company’s understanding and awareness of potential electrification combinations for the mining industry, and drive future research and development opportunities.. Liebherr has existing electric mining equipment solutions and has supplied electrified haul trucks and mining excavators in multiple countries. For most Liebherr haul trucks, the company offers a trolley solution, including switch back capable trolley technology for the T 236. This technology was recently awarded the most innovative haulage technology in surface mining by Mining Magazine in the category “Load/Haul”. For their excavator range, Liebherr offers electrically powered solutions for all size classes, adaptable to different tensions and frequencies. Liebherr is engaging with multiple major mining companies for decarbonisation analysis, as part of their approach to zero emission mining. ABB will be a strong support for these discussions linked to mine electrification.“The Liebherr Mining team shares our commitment to developing solutions for mining operations that have net zero emissions at their core,” said Mehrzad Ashnagaran, ABB’s Global Product Line Manager - Electrification and Composite Plant. “Building from our trolley assist infrastructure, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions greatly, we can be part of wider electrification plans and help set bold targets for the near-future.”“The ABB team is covering a very large footprint in the surface mining industry with a strong reputation in the supply of electrical infrastructure solutions,” said Peter Hoeher, Liebherr Mining Equipment Newport News Managing Director. “Trolley applications will be the key technology to reduce the overall GHG emissions from surface mining operations in the fastest way possible whilst maintaining all the benefits of haul trucks in terms of performance, cost, and operational flexibility. We also consider trolley as a key technology for fully electrified haul truck solutions.”ABB has already collaborated with mining operators from initial feasibility studies, through concept development and full deployment. Its electrification solutions, including trolley assist, are already active in mines in Sweden and in late 2021 in Canada.This partnership announcement follows a call from ABB earlier this year for greater collaboration between OEMs and key technology suppliers. The shared mission to develop a combination of solutions will enhance the efficiency and flexibility of customer businesses and contribute to the reduction of CO₂, supporting a sustainable society..

First Quantum to operate world’s largest ultra-class truck trolley fleet with Liebherr T 284,News |09/15/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/first-quantum-to-operate-world%E2%80%99s-largest-ultra-class-truck-trolley-fleet-with-liebherr-t-284.html?page=55,"As mining customers around the world show greater urgency to reduce CO2 emissions, innovative solutions such as Trolley Assist Systems present a step towards mine site electrification, paving the road for zero emission mines of the future. Liebherr Mining offers a range of solutions to help customers lower their emissions, including the Trolley Assist System for its full mining haul truck range.Find out more",News,09/15/2021,"The Trolley Assist System uses onboard pantographs to connect the truck’s drive system to overhead power lines on uphill haulage segments. When connected to the overhead power lines in trolley mode, the full power capacity of the electric wheel motors can be translated into speed on grade while the diesel engine idles, improving productivity while reducing emissions, fuel consumption, and operating costs.In 2013, Liebherr received an initial request from First Quantum Minerals Limited (FQML) to develop a 360 t / 397 ton trolley-capable haul truck for mine sites in Panama and Zambia. The trucks were required to integrate with the trolley power line that FQML had designed and developed for the sites.. Agreeing to this partnership, Liebherr engineers began developing, testing, and verifying the trolley solution. Two Liebherr T 284 trucks with the Trolley Assist System were commissioned at Sentinel copper mine in Zambia in 2016 and testing of the trolley solution began in February of 2017, with twelve months allotted for the customer to evaluate the trucks, the trolley, and the customer service.At the end of the trial period, FQML expressed they were pleased with the results of the Trolley Assist System and the performance of the T 284, leading to an order for six more trolley-capable T 284 trucks at Sentinel mine, along with thirty trolley-capable T 284 trucks for Cobre Panama copper mine in Central South America.As a mark of success of the partnership between FQML and Liebherr, along with the performance of the T 284 with trolley solution, FQML recently confirmed an order for a further 11 T 284 trucks. These three trucks for Sentinel mine and eight trucks for Cobre Panama mine, will join the existing fleets operating with the Trolley Assist System. This soon-to-be fleet of 38 T 284s in Panama will claim the title of the world’s largest ultra-class truck fleet on trolley.“Trolley Assist truck systems have become integral to the development of First Quantum’s large scale open pit truck haulage operations,” said an FQML representative. “Over the last decade, First Quantum has emerged as one of the industry leaders in implementation of Trolley Assist systems across mine planning and design, installation, operations, and maintenance. We consider our purpose designed Trolley Assist systems deliver a step change in measurable haulage performance through increased truck productivity, improved maintenance cost, and reduced carbon emissions.”“During the past five years, Liebherr has proven itself as a pro-active partner in the development of Trolley Assist capable truck fleet systems,” they continued. “First Quantum has selected the Liebherr T 284 ultra-class truck for some of our Trolley Assist deployments at our large-scale mining operations in Zambia and more recently as the sole deployed truck at our Panama mining operations. With a high degree of co-operation between our organisations, we see this partnership continuing to grow in years to come.”Oliver Hoelzer, Director of Mining Liebherr-Panamá confirmed, “Even before the arrival of the very first truck, Liebherr Panama’s relationship with FQML Panama has been more of a mutual partnership than a pure business relationship. Our highly committed team recognises that Liebherr’s own success is intrinsically linked to the success of FQML.”Liebherr has also delivered six trolley-capable 100 t / 110 ton T 236 haul trucks in Austria, bringing the total number of Liebherr trucks with the Trolley Assist System to 56 once FQML’s newest fleets has been commissioned.Liebherr continues to pursue low emission technology for its equipment, with a target to offer fossil fuel free solutions for its entire digging, dozing, and hauling product range by 2030."
"New 36 XXT truck mounted concrete pump from Liebherr: Light, compact and flexible",Press releases |09/15/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-36-xxt-truck-mounted-concrete-pump-from-liebherr-light-compact-and-flexible.html?page=56,Innovative technologies have been combined in a compact machine: The new 36 XXT truck mounted concrete pump combines the advantages of the new quintuple folding boom with the Powerbloc drive unit and the semi-closed oil circuit. The whole thing has also been given a new and appealing look.Find out more,Press releases,09/15/2021,"Following extensive testing, sales of Liebherr's completely newly developed 36 XXT truck mounted concrete pump are now starting. The result: A real all-rounder, packed with technical innovations from Liebherr. A large number of the pump drivers' wishes were taken into account, such as ergonomic access steps, simplified accessibility and an expansion of the stowage and storage options.An extremely compact assembly with no boom overhang at the rear ensures high manoeuvrability in confined spaces. The machine is weight-optimised and therefore travels with a total weight of around 26 tonnes on three axles, depending on the equipment. The XXT support ensures perfect stability. It shows its strengths particularly when it comes to narrow supports, so confined spaces are no problem. The modern radio remote control allows sensitive boom movements. The clear colour display shows the operator all important parameters.The new 5-piece boom allows maximum flexibility on the construction site. Especially when concreting in buildings, the boom proves to have very good slip properties. The five arms make it easy to reach a wide variety of positions on the construction site. The design and kinematics of the boom ensure low-vibration and even work when placing concrete.The shape of the charging hopper favours a uniform flow of concrete and very good suction behaviour. Two separately driven agitators push the concrete directly into the suction area, which works perfectly even with concrete types that are difficult to pump.. Unique Powerbloc drive unit A major highlight of the new 36 XXT is Liebherr's newly developed “Powerbloc” pump drive unit. It is characterised by the fact that all hydraulic switching and measuring elements are fully integrated. This eliminates the need for numerous hydraulic hoses and other components previously required. The drive unit is therefore a special kind in the concrete pump world. Features of the new system are its robustness, high performance and quiet running.. Semi-closed oil circuit (HCC)The new drive unit is combined with the highly efficient semi-closed oil circuit, which supplies all drives powerfully and reliably with hydraulic energy. As a result, the oil volume could be significantly reduced. The new Liebherr system combines the advantages of the proven open and closed circuits currently on the market, without their respective disadvantages. Customers confirm the quiet and powerful operation of the pump unit.Thanks to the extensive accessories catalogue, no wishes remain unfulfilled for the customer: For example, state-of-the-art LED lighting designs for optimal work in the dark, various storage boxes for materials and tools as well as shelves for extension hoses are available..

Liebherr Mining advances Zero Emission Program,Press releases |09/14/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-mining-advances-zero-emission-program.html?page=56,"Liebherr strives for long-term sustainable solutions, investigating different options centred on environmental sustainability, safety, cost, flexibility, and maintainability. Liebherr Mining already offers a range of solutions to help customers reduce emissions, and has clear targets and a roadmap to expand its current offering to achieve low carbon solutions in 2022, along with fossil fuel free solutions for the majority of applications by 2030.Find out more",Press releases,09/14/2021,"Las Vegas (USA), 14 September 2021 –The global mining industry has demonstrated its commitment to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in support of the Paris Agreement, with many major mining houses announcing decarbonisation targets over the past 18 months. This increased focus on GHG emission reduction has accelerated the implementation of Liebherr’s existing low carbon solutions and triggered future projects to offer completely fossil fuel free mining equipment options. Liebherr Mining’s strategy to reduce GHG emissions will mainly focus on the operational phase of their machinery, as studies showed that more than 90% of GHG emissions over the complete lifecycle of the equipment occurred during this phase.Liebherr Mining’s Zero Emission Program, which was established to develop these future solutions, is well aligned with the values of the Liebherr Group as an independent and responsible, family-owned company.The Liebherr Group has existing in-house core competencies, across all 13 product segments, in electrification, batteries, internal combustion engines, injection systems and alternative renewable fuels. Building from this experience, the Zero Emission Program has clear targets and a roadmap to achieve low carbon solutions for the full range of off-highway trucks and excavators in 2022, and fossil fuel free solutions for the majority of applications by 2030.The Zero Emission Program strives to deliver long-term sustainable products and services, providing different options centred on environmental sustainability, safety, cost, flexibility, and maintainability. Modularisation, along with an energy type agnostic approach to drivetrains, are key elements in Liebherr Mining’s strategy, easing the transition for customers with the possibility to retrofit modules.. 2022 target: Liebherr’s low carbon emission technologyLiebherr Mining has developed and offered electrification solutions for many years and is now about to finalise all initiatives to achieve its first 2022 target to offer low carbon emission solutions for its complete digging and hauling range. The technologies, including the haul truck Trolley Assist System and electric excavator range, are consistently achieving proven results in the field to lower carbon emissions. The newly introduced in-built Liebherr Power Efficiency control system has also shown excellent results since field operation began in 2019.. Trolley Assist System for Liebherr haul trucksWith the T 264 trolley components production ready in 2022, all Liebherr trucks will be available with Trolley Assist System, providing a low emission solution for customers.The Liebherr Trolley Assist System is an effective first step on the road to zero emission mine sites of the future. Utilising an overhead pantograph or trolley bars to connect the electric-drive system to the electrical network, the Trolley Assist System offers increased truck fleet productivity, or reduction in fleet size, while maintaining yearly production when compared with standard trucks. A significant reduction of diesel fuel consumption is also made possible with the Trolley Assist System along with a reduction of the truck fleet CO2 emissions. However, this of course depends on the percentage of renewable energy content in the grid supplied power.Liebherr delivers proven field experience with 39 T 284 units fitted with the Trolley Assist System currently in operation on two different sites, with more to be commissioned in 2022. Liebherr is also the first company to run a 100 t truck under trolley, with a fleet of T 236 trucks running on a 5 km trolley line in Austria - the longest trolley line in the world.. The largest range of electric excavatorsThe Liebherr Group has over 30 years of experience in electric driven machines for earthmoving, material handling and mining applications. Today, Liebherr Mining is the OEM that offers the largest range of electric driven excavators on the market. Ranging from 130 t to 800 t, the R 9150, R 9200, R 9250, R 9350, R 9400, and R 9800 are all available as electric drive versions. The electric drive R 9600 will soon be available.Liebherr electric excavators are existing and already proven solutions helping customers to build future sustainable mine sites. Focusing on reliability, maintainability, and maximum safety, Liebherr’s engineering teams strive for solutions requiring minimum change to existing energy infrastructure and operational behaviour on customer sites. Thanks to 70% of parts commonality with diesel versions, Liebherr also offers complete retrofit options for existing machines.To offer better machine mobility and safety for the workforce on site, Liebherr has developed a cable reel option for all electric drive excavators either in backhoe or face shovel. The cable reel is completely autonomous and has a capacity up to 300 m depending on the excavator type. Furthermore, Liebherr proposes an operational concept for excavators with cable reel in backhoe application, particularly in double benching operations.. Move more for less: Liebherr Power EfficiencyLiebherr is continuously improving and upgrading its standard machines to enable the transition to emission reductions. Liebherr Power Efficiency (LPE) is the most recent built-in technology upgrade making this productivity and sustainability contribution.Starting with Generation 7, all Liebherr mining excavators will be equipped with Liebherr Power Efficiency (LPE) as standard. This specific engine and hydraulic management system drastically reduces fuel consumption by up to 20%.The system:- adapts piloting processes according to operator requirements- electronically controls pressure and oil flow- has increased efficiency of the control valves and the new Liebherr pumps- has a fully integrated engine control system- reduces hydraulic losses and load profile of the engine for increased component lifetime- reduces energy consumption without impact on the machine performanceBased on constant research and development, Liebherr is able to provide size-equivalent machinery with higher production rates and less fuel consumption.In fact, the combination of LPE together with the improved productivity of the R 9600 has shown 29% less fuel consumption per tonne of produced material over a one-year production study, compared to its predecessor, the R 996B. Expressed in fuel efficiency, tons per litre, this corresponds to a 40% better utilisation of the fuel.These outstanding efficiencies allow Liebherr excavators to set new benchmarks in their respective classes and are a very important enablers for any kind of future drive train, as they significantly reduce the effort for cable handling or refuelling and storage of alternative fuels.. Pathway to Zero Emission solutionsAs second step, Liebherr is now targeting to offer completely fossil fuel free mining equipment for hauling, digging, and dozing by 2030. This development will take into consideration the GHG emissions over equipment’s full lifecycle, as well as the overall well-to-wheel energy ecosystem. The company is also taking into account the operational mining process conditions that influence the right energy type choice.Liebherr will develop three drivetrain options to achieve near zero emissions for its off-highway trucks: battery power module, internal combustion engines powered by renewable fuels, and H2 fuel cell-battery power module.Drivetrain electrification through battery combined with trolley assist is already underway.Despite some challenges, Liebherr sees also an opportunity that the propulsion energy can be provided by using hydrogen fuel cell-battery hybrids.Research and development for internal combustion engines operating with renewable-based alternative fuels is progressing very well within the Liebherr Group, with Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) as an approved fuel for machines powered by Liebherr engines as a first step. Hydrogen combustion engines are also currently being tested in Liebherr’s factory in Switzerland. The methanol combustion process has been developed for large displacement engines and is ready to move towards serial engine industrialisation based on market demand. Additionally, the ammonia combustion process is under investigation, with Liebherr seeing high potential in the usage of ammonia for heavy mobile, high energy demanding machines and gensets.Liebherr mining excavators and dozers will also both have the option to be powered by internal combustion engines running on alternative fuels, along with the already existing electric drive version for excavators.To achieve near zero emissions for the mining dozer and excavator, it is also crucial to utilise the most efficient drive system to reduce fuel consumption. The Liebherr hydrostatic drive system already achieves up to 20% improved fuel efficiency compared to mechanical competitor products. Despite this, Liebherr is currently in the process of comparing efficiency of an electric drive on a dozer prototype with hydrostatic drive efficiency. Given Liebherr’s expertise in both hydrostatic and electric AC drive systems, the company is in best position to choose the most appropriate option for the best drive system for the near zero emission solution.To accelerate the process and ensure the best solutions will be offered, Liebherr is partnering with industry experts for their Zero Emission Program. ABB, a leader in power and automation technologies, develops state-of-the-art technology and equipment for overall electrification of mine sites and supports our customers and Liebherr with a particular focus on trolley assist infrastructure deployment. ENGIE, the global reference in renewable hydrogen, low-carbon energy, and services, will jointly with Liebherr evaluate the different renewable energy solutions, in particular renewable hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels, for loading, hauling, and dozing processes. This cooperation ensures that an integrated well-to-wheel approach is basis to define the best solutions for the mining industry.With concept studies nearly finalised for trolley-battery hybrid, and ammonia and methanol for internal combustion engines, Liebherr expects to undertake field validation from 2024-2026, followed by the integration of proven fossil fuel free solutions from 2026-2030 into the entire range of mining machines..

It went to the crane and heavy transport company Allied Crane Hire, based in Cape Town, South Africa. The long telescopic boom of the 230-tonne crane and technical innovations such as VarioBallast®, VarioBase® and the Liebherr Single Engine Concept were important decision-making criteria.Find out more",Press releases,09/14/2021,"Allied Crane Hire has established itself as a specialist in crane hire in sub-Saharan Africa. The 24-year-old company operates more than 80 mobile and crawler cranes, which are mainly used in petrochemicals, mining, wind and solar farms and the construction industry. The company bought its first Liebherr crane 20 years ago.The LTM 1230-5.1 is now the latest model in the fleet. André Engelbrecht, Managing Director at Allied Crane Hire, explains: “Crane experts will agree that Liebherr has the best technology in mobile and crawler cranes and is a pioneer in the industry. An important criterion for us in choosing the LTM 1230 5.1 was its 75-metre telescopic boom. This allows us to do many crane jobs without having to set up a lattice jib”. The Liebherr LTM 1230-5.1 is an ideal crane for work in steep positions and at great heights, for example in wind turbine maintenance or petrochemical operations. With lattice extensions, the LTM 1230-5.1 reaches a maximum lifting height of 111 metres.Another important purchase criterion for Allied Crane Hire was the Liebherr VarioBallast®. The ballast radius of the LTM 1230-5.1 can be adjusted between 4.8 and 5.7 metres. “Operations in the petrochemical and mining industries are extremely challenging: little space, time pressure and constantly changing conditions. This calls for high flexibility from the cranes,"" declares Engelbrecht.. Mobile crane specially designed for VarioBase®The engineers at Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH put the multi-award-winning VarioBase® support technology at the heart of the structural steel construction when creating the concept for the LTM 1230 5.1. This makes it the first crane to have an asymmetrical support base: The width is 7.4 metres at the front and 8.1 metres at the rear.“Thanks to VarioBase®, it’s now possible to enable really high lifting capacities, especially in the rear working area, over the 8.1 metre wide supports – calculated in real-time by the LICCON controller”, explains Erik Benz, Head of the Mobile and Crawler Cranes Division at Liebherr-Africa. “This new digitalisation option has a major influence on the structural steel technology, while enhancing customer benefit in the form of increased lifting capacities”.“We call the combination of trapezoidal and variable support base VarioBase®Plus”, adds Francois Pretorius, Sales Representative at Liebherr-Africa. “The single-stage sliding beams at the front are lighter. The weight saved could be used to increase the boom length.”Allied Crane Hire also appreciates the many other technical Liebherr innovations, such as the Single Engine Concept and ECOmode, which reduce fuel consumption and noise emissions. “Many of our working conditions are really tough – so efficiency is a fundamental requirement for all the machines we operate. The new LTM 1230-5.1 is characterised by high performance, economy and flexibility – thanks to Liebherr's systematic advancement of successful technologies”, states Engelbrecht..

Liebherr presents rough-terrain crane LRT 1090-2.1 at MINExpo in Las Vegas,News |09/13/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-presents-rough-terrain-crane-lrt-1090-2.1-at-minexpo-in-las-vegas.html?page=57,"Liebherr is showcasing the LRT 1090-2.1 rough-terrain crane at MINExpo International® 2021 in Las Vegas from 13-15 September. The 100-US-ton (90 metric tonnes) crane was designed to deliver a high safety level. It is fitted as standard with an outrigger monitor, which automatically detects the support status and includes it in the crane control system. It is also delivered as standard with the VarioBase® variable support base, enhancing flexibility on site and increasing the crane’s lifting capacity.Find out more",News,09/13/2021,"Las Vegas (USA), 13 September 2021 - High safety levels in every respect were the main priority for the design of the Liebherr LRT 1090-2.1 rough-terrain crane. It features an outrigger monitoring system as standard. The support status, on tyres or outriggers, is detected automatically and saved to the crane controller. The attachment of the ballast to the turntable and the installation of the optional double folding jib including its angle adjustment are also recorded and monitored.The VarioBase® variable support base developed by Liebherr, and fitted as standard on the LRT 1090-2.1, makes an important contribution to enhancing safety. VarioBase® allows each individual outrigger beam to be extended to arbitrary lengths. The crane work is controlled by the load moment limiter within the LICCON controller which calculates the maximum load capacities precisely for the current situation. This prevents accidents by human error during the assembly process and when hoisting loads. VarioBase® also provides greater flexibility on site. As a result of the increased lifting capacities when hoisting over the supports, the crane can hoist loads normally reserved for the next size crane class.Safety is also enhanced by providing greater comfort for the crane operator. For example, the crane cabin is 220 mm / 8.5"" wider than other standard cabins on the market. It can be tilted backwards to provide greater comfort when hoisting loads to great heights. Clear, self-explanatory controls make the crane easy to handle. They allow the crane operator to focus on the task at hand: working with the crane and the load. A cooler and USB charging socket are standard features in the cabin.Ladders, a large number of handles, and an electrically extending platform on the cabin, ensure safe access to the crane. The LRT 1090-2.1 features a wide range of storage boxes for accessories, rigging equipment, and support timber as standard. There is also a storage facility for the crane hook.. Excellent off-road capacity and low cost global transportThe LRT 1090-2.1 is powerful and robust, has excellent off-road capability, and is also highly manoeuvrable. It is powered by a Cummins diesel engine which meets all current emissions regulations. The 201 kW / 270 hp engine supplies a maximum torque of 990 Nm / 730 lb-ft. A 6-speed powershift transmission from DANA and large 29.5 R25 tyres guarantee the required off-road capability for the crane. All-wheel and crab steering ensure easy handling and high manoeuvrability in constricted conditions.The LRT 1090-2.1 measures 3.87 m / 12'8"" in height and 3.3 m / 10'10"" wide and is transported on public roads with a low loader. The crane’s curb weight is less than 121,000 lbs (55 tonnes) with complete equipment including ballast, or under 88,000 lbs (40 tonnes) without ballast and equipment, meaning the crane can be transported worldwide at low cost. The LRT 1090-2.1 can be readied for use quickly and is easy to assemble once onsite. The outrigger pads, which remain inside the width of the vehicle, contribute to this quick setup as they are not required to be removed for transport.. High lifting capacities with long telescopic boomThe LRT 1090-2.1 features a 47 m / 154 ft telescopic boom. Its telescoping system consists of a two-stage hydraulic cylinder with a rope extension mechanism. The boom can be extended easily with two telescoping modes: strong or long. The extension mechanism has been designed for high telescoping lifting capacities.A second winch and the rooster sheave are included as standard on the basic machine for two-hook operation. As an option, a 10.5 - 19 m / 34.5 - 62 ft double folding jib can be installed on the telescopic boom. It can be attached at an angle of 0°, 20° or 40°..

The display at the expo, which includes products from Liebherr’s Mining, Components, as well as Mobile and Crawler Cranes product segments, showcases Liebherr’s cutting-edge developments improving operational safety, sustainability, and performance.Find out more",Press releases,09/13/2021,"Las Vegas (USA), 13 September 2021 – Liebherr presents the latest editions and upgrades for its mining product range at MINExpo International® 2021. Including equipment from its hydraulic excavator, haul truck, dozer, components, and rough terrain mobile crane product lines, the OEM’s product developments have been driven by modern technology to improve safety, sustainability, and performance for the mining industry.. New technology generation status for Liebherr excavatorsLiebherr Mining has introduced a new naming strategy for its hydraulic excavator product line. To achieve alignment within the Earthmoving and Mining product segments of the Liebherr Group, a generation status based on the technology level within the equipment will be used to provide product designations.Liebherr’s current excavator product line begins with Generation 6, with the R 9150 and R 9200 holding Generation 7 status, and the newly released R 9600 holding the most technologically advanced generation status, Generation 8.. R 9150 G7 excavator - highest excavating forces with reduced fuel consumptionThe newest generation of the R 9150 is presented on the MINExpo booth. The 130 t / 143 ton excavator with the proven 565 kW / 757 HP Liebherr V12 diesel engine is equipped with an 8.8 m3 / 11.5 yd3 EVO bucket and Liebherr GET.The R 9150 G7 is a perfect loader for 50 t up to 100 t trucks and offering a wide array of uses, this machine reaches the highest excavating forces and an optimal cycle time.All Generation 7 mining excavators will be equipped with the necessary hardware to receive the optional Assistance Systems and will be equipped with Liebherr Power Efficiency (LPE) as standard. This specific engine and hydraulic management drastically reduces fuel consumption by adapting piloting processes according to operator requirements and machine condition, by electronically controlling pressure and oil flow and by reducing hydraulic throttling and load profile of the engine for increased component lifetime.The machine also comes with an intelligent power management system with a closed-loop swing circuit. Kinetic energy is recovered when the swing motion is used during deceleration to drive the main and auxiliary pumps. Together with LPE, this reduces fuel consumption even more and supports faster boom lift speed. Cylinder dampening through IMUs provides smoother attachment movements without affecting attachment speed.The independent cooling system provides independently and electronically managed oil and water-cooling fans. The oversized cooling systems reduce parasitic demand on engine horsepower ensuring maximum available horsepower is provided to the excavator working circuits.The valve bank control system has also been renewed with under slung arch hoses to improve lifetime, new flow optimised hose fittings, reduced hydraulic pressure losses, and pilot valves integrated into valve blocks.. R 9600 G8 excavator – new standardsEarlier this year Liebherr Mining launched the new R 9600 after years of development. This 600 t excavator sets new standards in open pit mining. The successor of the popular R 996B entered the market after gaining a year of field experience in Australia, the largest market for 600 t class excavators. A total of 9 units will have been commissioned in the country by end of 2021. The R 9600 will enter serial production at the end of this year.Customer input has played an important and pivotal role in the development of this new machine. Engineering, sales, and marketing teams have collected feedback and insights from mine site equipment operators, maintenance personnel, and procurement groups as well as executive management to have a clear understanding of the challenges they meet every day. The new R 9600 aims to reach the highest standard in terms of safety, sustainability, performance, lifetime, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), ease of maintenance, and more.In April 2021, a production study was conducted by Liebherr-Australia at Curragh North mine site to measure operational efficiency of the new R 9600 as an individual unit, as well as in comparison to the R 996B operating at the site. Thiess Pty Ltd has held successive mining services con¬tracts at Curragh North since 2004. This production study determined the R 9600 to be 19.6% more productive and 19.8% faster than the R 996B on site. With 18.2% less annual fuel consumption, the new Liebherr 600 t class mining excavator has 40% more fuel efficiency than its predecessor.The clear advantages of the R 9600 not only in comparison to the R 996B but also as a leader in the600 t mining excavator class, has led the customer Thiess to purchase two additional R 9600 units for 2022 for a separate mining services contract.The R 9600 is equipped with two QSK50 Cummins engines with advanced combustion technologies. For emission regulated regions, a US EPA Tier 4f / EU Stage V compliant version is available with the latest SCR after-treatment technology. Complying with stringent emission regulations, the SCR system reduces nitrogen oxides by injecting a liquid reductant into the exhaust stream.An electric drive version will soon be available - a productive choice to balance performance with environmental consciousness.This Generation 8 hydraulic excavator also includes the newest technological innovations developed by Liebherr Mining. The excavator is equipped as standard with Liebherr Power Efficiency, Assistance Systems (included in the first year) with a large 15” touch screen, and the latest electronic architecture leading the way towards machine automation and state-of-the-art on-board technologies..

Allamanno: Liebherr wheel loader and crawler excavator in the French département of Hautes-Alpes,Press releases |09/09/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/allamanno-liebherr-wheel-loader-and-crawler-excavator-in-the-french-departement-of-hautes-alpes.html?page=57,"Allamanno has recently purchased an L 538 wheel loader and an R 922 crawler excavator. The machines meet all the customer's safety and quality requirements. In the future, they will work both in urban environments and in the preparation of ski slopes at higher altitudes.Find out more",Press releases,09/09/2021,"In addition to its performance and reliability, the Liebherr L 538 Allamanno wheel loader also impressed with its safety concept - a very important point for both partners. The L 538 is equipped with an active assistance system for detecting people, a solution developed by Liebherr which is fully integrated into the machine control system. It is designed to optimise the safety and comfort of the machine operator by reporting the presence of people behind the machine through audible signals and on-screen warnings. Active personnel detection can distinguish between people and objects using the latest camera technology, so that unnecessary warning signals are avoided. This reduces the driver's workload and lowers the risk of accidents: on construction sites in the city, where many people are on the move, as well as in the mountains, where visibility is not always good due to the terrain.. The R 922 G8: Versatility and productivity with the LIKUFIX hydraulic coupling systemThe R 922 G8 has recently become part of Allamanno's machine fleet. Liebherr’s Generation 8 crawler excavators are characterised by high tractive and digging forces as well as increased performance, which is achieved by a powerful exhaust Stage V engine. An LED lighting system ensures additional safety. At Allamanno, they particularly appreciate the comfort and reliability of the R 922 G8, with almost 2,000 operating hours per year. It is manoeuvrable and fast and can be used for numerous classic earthworks, for example for preparing slopes before the winter season.. The new R 922, like all of Allamanno’s excavators, is fitted with a LIKUFIX hydraulic quick coupling systems which maximises the productivity of the excavator. The operator can change mechanical and hydraulic tools easily, quickly and safely from the cab. Earthmoving and trenching buckets complete the range of equipment on the R 922 G8 for the various construction sites.. A solid and close partnership“The cooperation with Liebherr extends to concrete mixers and mobile cranes. In our collaboration with several business units of the group, we can speak of a true partnership,” confirms Aymeric Cuvelier, who is responsible for machine equipment at Allamanno. This partnership is based on shared values as well as a close relationship with a personal togetherness. “It is very important to have real contacts on the phone,” notes Aymeric Cuvelier. Equally important for Allamanno is the French or European origin of Liebherr products.The Liebherr brand also enjoys a very good reputation for the quality and responsiveness of its after-sales service. Its efficient organisation is fully confirmed by Allamanno: “The customer service - both from Liebherr and Ets PIC - is very well organised, competent and responsive. The machines are also thoughtfully designed, especially for our mountain applications.”. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

LTM 1450-8.1 from Advanced Cranes dismantles weir in Victoria,Press releases |09/07/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/ltm-1450-81-from-advanced-cranes-dismantles-weir-in-victoria.html?page=57,"The restricted set-up area for a crane made this job a real challenge – an LTM 1450-8.1 from Australian crane contractor Advanced Cranes and Rigging dismantled a weir in Maffra. The hoisting equipment on the 60 year old structure and its concrete bridge were replaced. The weir is on Macalister River, around 200 kilometres east of Melbourne.Find out more",Press releases,09/07/2021,"“Our LTM 1450-8.1 was the first crane of this type delivered to Victoria”, says Adam Tuddenham, Managing Director of Advanced Cranes and Rigging. The 8-axle crane has been part of Advanced Cranes’ fleet since 2020. “Today it is still the only crane of this type in the State of Victoria and is delivering reliable, valuable services for us.” The Liebherr 450-tonne crane can be described as a large fast-erecting crane as it combines particularly good mobility with short set-up times on site. At the same time, it delivers incredible capacity with its long, powerful telescopic boom.. Restricted set-up area for the large craneFor the job in Maffra, the constricted area for the crane position and the set-up work posed something of a challenge to the team – the LTM 1450-8.1 had to be positioned so that it could complete the hoisting process over the side whilst remaining within the required working radius. The steep slope, uneven terrain and an underground water tunnel made the search for a suitable crane position even harder. By using additional crane mats, the Advanced Cranes team finally managed to level the LTM 1450-8.1 adequately.. Advanced Cranes set up the LTM 1450-8.1 with a 28 metre luffing lattice jib and total ballast of 134 tonnes for this job. VarioBallast® is one of the special features of the Liebherr crane. The ballast radius can be infinitely varied using a simple hydraulic slewing mechanism. At maximum radius, the lifting capacity is also at its maximum. The radius can be reduced in constricted conditions.Two core holes had been drilled into the 60 year old bridge before the crane started work. The attachment chains were threaded through these and connected using a 9 metre spreader bar. Ultimately the Advanced Cranes team and their LTM 1450-8.1 completed the hoisting work without any problems. They dismantled the existing gate lifting equipment for the weir and the reinforced concrete bridge. The heaviest load for the 8-axle crane was 32 tonnes plus 4 tonnes for rigging and hook at a 34-metre radius and a maximum hook height of 20 metres..

Liebherr L 586 XPower® wheel loaders perform impressively in load-and-carry operationsThe low fuel consumption is particularly worth noting because the wheel loaders, weighing more than 33 tonnes, are fitted with a range of special equipment for mining operations. The tyre protection chains are particularly distinctive and weigh up to 800 kilograms each depending on the version. Their main purpose is to improve traction in combination with the automatic self-locking differential. “The limestone soil in our quarries gets muddy and slippery particularly when it has been raining and this means we need the tyre protection chains,” explains Wilhelm Rinsche.. The main task of the wheel loader is to transport blasted material from the quarry face to the crusher. In this load-and-carry operation, the machines cover distances of up to 200 m. The wheel loaders also help with reloading. “Besides the low fuel consumption, we appreciate the consistently high power our Liebherr wheel loaders provide.

Smart support from Liebherr High-Top crane boosts production,Press releases |08/31/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/smart-support-from-liebherr-high-top-crane-boosts-production.html?page=58,"Powerful, space-saving and solid – this is how Antonio Basso S.p.A, an Italian manufacturer of pre-cast concrete parts, describes the 1000 EC-H 50 Litronic crane from Liebherr. The crane moves pre-cast concrete parts weighing several tonnes on a daily basis at the company’s headquarters in Treviso and is intelligently networked with the ERP system there. The incline of the on-site crane track also played a pivotal role in opting for the new machine from Liebherr.Find out more",Press releases,08/31/2021,"""The crane is like a Ferrari – it’s extremely fast,"" says managing director Giovanni Basso from Treviso. Antonio Basso S.p.A was the first customer in Italy to acquire a Liebherr 1000 EC-H 50 Litronic tower crane back in July 2019. Tower Crane Solutions (TCS) tailored the design of the crane to meet the requirements of the pre-cast concrete parts manufacturer. Giovanni Basso has been successfully deploying the largest standard crane in Liebherr’s EC-H series as a reliable part of the production process for two years now. He was the first customer in Italy and one of the first customers worldwide to receive the new-look 1000 EC-H 50 Litronic.Twelve hours a day, five days a week: The 1000 EC-H 50 Litronic is in constant operation and is at its busiest in summer. The tower crane moves up to 45 tonnes during its work, which involves picking up pre-cast elements from production, delivering them to the storage area and then loading the parts onto trucks later on. “We produce the parts for foundations, floors, roofs and chimneys,"" explains Giovanni Basso. Façades in various designs and specially shaped bridge sections round off the company’s product portfolio.. Portal enables efficient operationThe crane is mounted on a 10-metre portal, has a jib length of 50 metres and a hook height of approx. 33 metres. The portal runs on rails so that the company can use the crane to cover every corner of the storage yard. “We have the ability to move pre-cast elements much faster than before thanks to the tower crane being on a rail-mounted portal, plus we have extra storage space underneath,"" says Giovanni Basso. “We don’t waste a single square metre of storage space. Thanks to the optimal use of space and the high handling capacity, we can achieve higher production volumes than before."" He also has other Liebherr machines like concrete mixing plants.The portal solution was one of the main reasons why the customer opted for the 1000 EC-H 50 Litronic. According to Giovanni Basso, Liebherr was the only supplier who came up with a suitable and complete solution regarding the incline of the on-site crane track. As a result of extensive calculations beforehand, the crane can now be operated safely and reliably anywhere within the yard. “We’re also very satisfied with the modern crane control system with PLC and especially the control of the slewing gears,"" says the managing director, adding that operation is easy and precise despite the crane’s enormous size.. Coordinated networking of systems For the hoist unit, the ideal choice was the 110 kW version. “As a large number of trucks are loaded each day, the handling of materials needs to run smoothly and quickly,"" he explains. For the most part, the team operates the crane from inside its cabin: “It’s a much more comfortable experience up there. You have a better overview and can feel the crane – that’s not possible with a remote control."" An interface between the crane control and the administrative production system ensures that every handled part can be tracked. “We’re living Industry 4.0,"" says Giovanni Basso enthusiastically.The strong gusts of wind that the region experiences, which can reach speeds of over 180 kilometres per hour, were an additional consideration. To address this, the crane is secured with special rail clamps each evening to ensure that it stays in place. In the event of a severe storm, the Portal can also be secured with steel ropes to a foundation embedded in the ground. Giovanni Basso concludes, “Our production process wouldn’t work without the crane. It’s at the heart of our family business."". Father founded the company almost 50 years ago Giovanni Basso’s father built up the company. Antonio Basso initially started out as a civil engineering contractor in 1972 and expanded his business to include the production of pre-cast concrete elements in 1976. At the end of the ’80s, the company experienced rapid growth thanks to a patent for an innovative roofing system for industrial buildings. The company’s headquarters and production facility are located near Treviso.

Liebherr: MK 88 Plus achieves 300 lifts in three days,Press releases |08/30/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-mk-88-plus-achieves-300-lifts-in-three-days.html?page=58,"An MK 88 Plus belonging to crane service provider Nolte Auto-Krane has completed a veritable lifting marathon as part of a structural inspection of the North Sea barrage near Husum. During its tough eight-week assignment, the Liebherr crane lifted more than 1,800 loads of various types. The placing of the stop gates alone entailed the machine completing 300 lifts in just three days.Find out more",Press releases,08/30/2021,"""The MK crane proved a great success”, reflects Oliver Andritter, who headed the steel work at the Husum harbour barrage, which was built back in 1975 to protect against storm surges. After 46 years, the time had come for the North Sea installation to undergo a thorough inspection. For this to happen, all water had to be removed from inside the barrage.Stop gates (also known as emergency gates) had to be erected first to ensure a dry working area. The MK 88 placed a total of around 300 stop logs and intermediate posts to keep the water out. It only took three days for the MK to place all elements in the water with absolute precision.. Quick positioning of postsCommercial divers provided instructions to guide the crane’s operators. Their common goal: to manoeuvre the 11-metre-long and 36 centimetre-wide posts into their correct positions at the base of the barrage. “The ability to move loads quickly via the trolley on the horizontal jib and the prompt, safe positioning of posts were both great advantages compared to what a telescopic crane could offer”, explains Andritter.Delivering the posts with centimetre precision was essential as the divers were working in murky waters with little visibility and, in some cases, at night. “I’m also very impressed that the crane can be dismantled in fifteen minutes and then swiftly moved to another position on site”, says Andritter, adding, “And its working speed is equally impressive.”. Faster completionThe excellent handling capacity of Liebherr mobile construction cranes was another factor that prompted Jürgen Peters to send an MK 88 Plus to the site. “We’d already had positive experiences with this crane on a similar job in Büsum three years before”, he explains. “We’re simply much faster with an MK on this type of assignment than we are with a regular telescopic crane.”Peters plans and is responsible for major crane projects at Nolte. As was the case in Büsum, he had a powerful heavy-duty crane at his disposal alongside the mobile construction crane, “We needed our Liebherr LG 1750 lattice tower crane to lift the flood protection gate wings, weighing up to 65 tonnes, off their hinges. The MK was responsible for the construction and dismantling of the gates and supplied the 13 metre-deep construction site chambers with everything that was needed.”Chris Kubinski and Manuel Krüger used their MK 88 Plus to lift pumps, generators, scaffolding parts, tools and even cherry pickers down to the engineers and labourers working in the emptied barrage chambers. The two experienced crane operators worked in shifts aboard the modern crane cabin.. Infinitely height-adjustable elevating cab is a hit“We were able to reach and do everything with the 45-metre jib from just two positions”, reports Chris Kubinski, who has previously worked with telescopic cranes. He now doesn’t want to part with the Liebherr mobile construction crane. The infinitely height-adjustable elevating cab, the crane’s fast assembly/disassembly (“It only takes me eleven minutes – that’s simply unbeatable!”) and its high working speed have made him a huge MK fan.“The way the mobile construction crane works has totally won me over”, says the crane operator, who mainly tackles balcony assemblies, façade work and, of course, roof projects with his MK 88 Plus. “Projecting edges aren’t a problem any more and it's much easier to keep the safety distance required when working near power lines.”But what excites him most is being able to move his loads safely from within the crane cabin, which can be positioned at hook height to provide a clear view of the action. He also likes the option of operating the crane via radio remote control, “It’s particularly ideal for assembling glass roofing or façades as I can stand right next to the fitters. Sometimes it’s all down to millimetre precision”, Kubinski says from experience. “I simply enjoy working with all the great options the crane offers.”. Mobile construction cranes always in operation“We’ve got three MK 88 cranes and a large MK 140 in our fleet”, shares Jürgen Peters. From Nolte Auto-Krane’s location in Hannover, he supplies construction sites all over Germany with some 30 Liebherr machines. His four mobile construction cranes are always in use. “MK cranes are being requested more and more often. Once site managers get to know this crane system, they often don’t want to use anything else for some jobs.”It was a very similar situation in Husum. It was expected that Peters would deploy the MK 88 Plus on site and especially for the assembly and dismantling of the emergency gates due to the crane’s optimal handling capacity. The 2.2 million Euro barrage project was completed faster than planned, not least because of the crane’s impressive handling performance. The passage to Husum harbour was reopened for skippers and boat owners a whole four days earlier than planned.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Here the 9-axle-crane debuts its operations in maintenance of a thermoelectric plant in the northeast of the country. Darcy Pacheco ordered the heavy-duty crane with telescopic boom extension and 91 metre luffing jib.Find out more",Press releases,08/30/2021,"Industrial maintenance increasingly demands equipment capable of operating in more restricted areas. What could easily be done with crawler cranes, due to their high lifting capacity at large radii, now often needs machines that are more compact and powerful at the same time. “When we choose for the LTM 1750-9.1, we had its high load capacities at large radii in mind,” says Eduardo Silva, maintenance director for Darcy Pacheco. “With this 800-tonne crane, we are able to perform services that we used to perform with crawler cranes, benefiting from greater mobility and the possibility of operating in more restricted locations”, he adds. The LTM 1750-9.1 mobile crane will operate mainly in the maintenance of industrial plants, such as petrochemicals, pulp industry and maintenance of wind farms.. Darcy Pacheco's LTM 1750-9.1 mobile crane arrived in Brazil equipped with the exclusive Liebherr VarioBase® system. With this variable supporting system, crane work is secured via the LICCON control system even when the crane outriggers are not fully extended, for example in restricted areas. The 800-tonne crane also has ECOdrive: The additional eco mode delivers enhanced drive properties which both save fuel and reduce noise.“Our partnership with Liebherr has been going on for years. We already had mobile cranes with capacities between 100 and 500 tonnes, and 400 to 750 tonnes crawler cranes in our fleet. Now we have increased capacity with this 800 tonne mobile crane”, as Eduardo Silva highlights about the acquisition of the new LTM 1750-9.1. “We are excited about the possibilities this crane offers. Furthermore, technical support, product quality and the excellent relationship we have with Liebherr are always factors that we take into account when making a decision for the manufacturer.”.

Real-time, fast and effective support is provided by Liebherr experts worldwide with second level backup support with OEM. Increased availability, longer service life, and reduced service costs are the advantages for each machine registered with XpertAssist.A new service eraFollowing the success and high demand of the Remote Service tool that was introduced last year, Liebherr has further enhanced its remote portfolio taking service to the next level. XpertAssist combines real-time expert advice from experienced technicians with a wide range of technical tools through an audio-visual connection. Immediate qualified fault analysis and online troubleshooting backed by step-by-step instructions mean assistance can be maximised and on-site attendances can be reduced to a minimum.

A debriefing via audio-video conference call to explain the work done, or to address possible findings is part and parcel of this new product. The mean time to repair is reduced by up to 50 %, and field service costs cut by up to 20 % per annum.. The next level of serviceXpertAssist extends to predictive maintenance advice and reports on individual machines or entire fleets, for example, reports on safety or machine and engine utilisation. The interactive performance review and advice on preventive maintenance ensure high machine availability and early budget planning. Service technicians normally spend up to 45 % of their time just travelling to/from site - both time-consuming and costly for all parties. Thanks to XpertAssist, availability of experts is increased through elimination of avoidable travel giving them more time to do their actual job – attending to customer needs. Less travel, less CO2 emissions - the environment also benefits through the reduced carbon footprint. An increasingly important factor in today’s world.Recent experience in the Middle East underlines the importance of quick and efficient technology when projects are thousands of kilometres away from base. “For our company, which has all operations and projects outside our home country of Turkey, such remote service is perfect,” explains Levent EKMEKÇİOĞLU, Company Manager of rem engineering, construction and trade co. ltd. He continues, “Assistance was provided by Liebherr remotely in Jordan with no travel or accommodation costs and no time delays.

Compact crane – Leitl adds LTC 1050-3.1 to its crane fleet,Press releases |08/16/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/compact-crane-leitl-adds-ltc-1050-3-1-to-its-crane-fleet.html?page=59,LK Leitl GmbH & Co. Kran KG based in Eggenfelden has extended its fleet with the purchase of a Liebherr LTC 1050 3.1 compact crane. The company plans to use this new crane particularly for jobs inside industrial buildings and in constricted environments. The Bavarian contractor decided to buy the elevating cab option which provides the crane operator with improved visibility of the site situation.Find out more,Press releases,08/16/2021,"Crane jobs in factory buildings often pose a real challenge as there is very little space either for driving or supporting a mobile crane. These jobs therefore require particularly compact cranes. Shareholder Sandro Leitl explains: “We decided to buy the LTC 1050-3.1 because we wanted it to enable us to tackle jobs inside industrial buildings and on constricted sites. It is perfect for hoisting work in tight spaces. And if things get even tighter, the front storage box can simply be removed. Furthermore, the compact Liebherr crane will even pass through clearance heights of just three metres. The LTC 1050-3.1 rounds off our fleet perfectly due to its flexibility.”. Variable single-cab craneThe cab concept used on the LTC 1050-3.1 is unique on mobile cranes. For driving on the road the cab is moved to the front of the vehicle using a telescopic arm. In this position the crane driver has better visibility and a good driving position, particularly at high speed. The elevating cab, which can take the crane operator to an eye level of 7.8 m, opens up whole new possibilities and some significant benefits compared to conventional machines. The drastically improved visibility in a site situation enhances safety for many crane jobs. Leitl therefore decided to buy the elevating cab. Operations Manager Alexander Krapf reports: “The operator telescopes the cab to the precise position that gives him the best view. That was another important criterion for us when we decided to buy the LTC 1050- 3.1”.. First job erecting a prefabricated houseAt its very first job, the LTC 1050-3.1 was able to demonstrate that its strengths are not restricted to jobs inside factory buildings, managing to drive along the narrow access road through a residential estate with a tight turning circle to a prefabricated house site in Bad Birnbach with consummate ease.The weight of the prefabricated components also presented no challenge for the 50 tonne crane. Crane Operator Stefan Wick, who was using the elevating cab for the first time, was delighted: “The height takes a bit of getting used to, but the visibility really is significantly better. It makes things so much easier”.The Leitl GroupThe Leitl Group has been established for more than 40 years and is a reliable partner for recycling, crane hire, forwarding and commercial vehicles. Leitl currently has a 55-strong workforce. All six of the company’s mobile cranes have been purchased from Liebherr.

At 66 metres, the 120 tonne crane has the longest telescopic boom in the 4-axle class and can hoist loads which were previously the domain of 5-axle cranes.Find out more",Press releases,08/11/2021,"The Sarlux refinery on an industrial estate in Sarroch on the south coast of Sardinia, west of the capital Cagliari, is one of the largest refineries on the Mediterranean. It is just a few kilometres away from headquarters of Mintor, which is involved in the fields of technical consultancy, production, assembly and maintenance of industrial plants in many different sectors of industry. The company has been working in the oil and gas industry, petrochemicals, chemicals, electricity and food production for over twenty years.. LTM 1120-4.1 perfect for jobs in petrochemical plantsMintor's cranes find a wide field of activity at the Sarlux refinery. The LTM 1120-4.1 is one of the newest mobile cranes and features a compact design together with a long, powerful telescopic boom. That makes it perfect for working in the petrochemicals industry. Giorgio Aru, Purchasing Manager at Mintor, explains: “We value the flexibility and reliability of the Liebherr 120 tonne crane. The precision of the crane movements is extremely important for working in oil and gas plants. High safety standards are essential for our company.”. A hoist height of 58 metres was required for the job on the flue’s emission system at the refinery. The 66 metre telescopic boom was easily long enough to reach this height. This meant that there was no need to erect lattice extensions to reach the hoist height, although this would normally have been necessary. Hoisting just half a tonne at a radius of 18.4 metres also failed to challenge the LTM 1120-4.1. Only 15.4 tonnes ballast had to be used, around half the maximum possible counterweight. However, the constricted conditions in the refinery certainly proved challenging. This meant that the option of using a compact 4-axle mobile crane was a major benefit.. Great economy and flexibilityThe Liebherr LTM 1120-4.1 can tackle jobs which normally would require a 5-axle crane, eliminating all the logistics work needed for the larger model. Because a 4-axle crane delivers benefits in terms of licensing and road permits, it can tackle jobs faster and with greater flexibility. The design of a 4-axle crane also enables it to tackle jobs where there is insufficient space for larger cranes. On constricted sites, in particular, Liebherr’s VarioBallast® and VarioBase® innovations deliver enhanced performance, flexibility and safety for this new crane model.. The VarioBallast® on the LTM 1120-4.1 enables the crane to operate with a ballast radius of 3.83 or 4.77 metres. The ballast radius can be reduced by 940 millimetres quickly and easily using standard, mechanically adjustable ballasting cylinders when site conditions get tight. The large ballast radius delivers higher performance and often also cost benefits by reducing ballast transport, as many crane jobs can be completed with fewer counterweights.The VarioBase® variable support base makes it possible to working constricted areas safely. The maximum lifting capacities are calculated individually and precisely for every situation. This ensures safe working practice with any chosen support base..

Number two: Paradiso takes delivery of Liebherr LG 1750 lattice boom mobile crane,Press releases |08/10/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/number-two-paradiso-takes-delivery-of-liebherr-lg-1750-lattice-boom-mobile-crane.html?page=59,The crane rental company Fratelli Paradiso S.r.l. has taken delivery of a Liebherr LG 1750 lattice boom mobile crane. It is already the second crane of this type in the fleet of the company from the Apulia region in the south of Italy. It will be used mainly for the assembly of wind turbines. The high demand in this area in Italy and the good experience with this type of crane were the reasons for the decision to purchase another LG 1750.Find out more,Press releases,08/10/2021,"In recent years, Fratelli Paradiso S.r.l. has focused its activities on the growing renewable energy market, especially wind energy. Michele Paradiso, owner and CEO of the company, explains, ""We recognize a higher demand for high performance cranes in Italy and we want to grow further by focusing on large cranes and investing in Liebherr products and the Liebherr brand."". He describes the 8-axle LG 1750 as the ""queen"" of cranes for the wind energy industry in the 750-tonne class. For several years, Paradiso has successfully operated the world's strongest lattice boom mobile crane, which led to the decision to purchase another crane of this type.The LG 1750 lattice boom mobile crane offers the flexibility of a 750 tonne crawler crane combined with the mobility of a high-speed truck crane. It thus combines the advantages of both crane types in one concept. For the LG 1750, Liebherr uses the crane slewing platform and boom system of the LR 1750 crawler crane as well as an eight-axle chassis of the latest design with speed-dependent rear-axle steering. The lattice boom mobile crane is therefore ideal for fast assembly operations in wind power, industrial construction or infrastructure. The chassis travels to the construction site with all four outriggers at a total weight of 96 tonnes. If required, the outriggers of the LG 1750 can be removed, thus reducing the weight to 48 tonnes.Liebherr offers a wide range of special wind power boom systems for the LG 1750, which are optimized for smaller and medium-sized turbines as well as for the latest generation of wind turbines with tower heights of up to more than 160 meters. ""We have chosen the SL8HS configuration with 119 meters, which is ideal for small to medium-sized turbines. We don't have to set up a derrick system for this. That saves time and money. But we can easily extend the crane later, up to the new powerful SX3 system with 165 meters"", says Paradiso.Fratelli Paradiso S.r.l. was founded in 1967 by Vito Paradiso. The family business is run by the second generation, Michele, Francesca and Silvia Paradiso. It operates an extensive fleet of medium to large cranes, including ten Liebherr cranes over 230 tonnes. The company is a recognised reference for crane work in Italy, but also throughout Europe and North Africa, especially for wind power applications..

Liebherr sells its 2000th 34 K fast-erecting crane,Press releases |08/09/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-sells-its-2000th-34-k-fast-erecting-crane.html?page=59,Liebherr has sold its 2000th 34 K fast-erecting crane to Mathis Bau AG. The Swiss construction and transport company is a long-standing customer of the construction machinery manufacturer and already uses several Liebherr cranes in its diverse areas of operation.Find out more,Press releases,08/09/2021,"Liebherr has a reason to celebrate: 2000 34 K fast-erecting cranes have left the production halls since its market launch in 1998. The milestone crane went to a Swiss customer. This is now the sixth Liebherr fast-erecting crane for the company Mathis Bau AG. The handover of the milestone crane took place at Liebherr-Baumaschinen AG in Reiden, Switzerland. Company owner Daniel Mathis, who collected his new crane personally by truck, particularly appreciates the reliability of these cranes, “I need machines that I can trust and that’s why I opt for Liebherr; it's a quality brand that allows me to offer my customers a first-class service.” Mathis Bau AG often undertakes work on construction sites in difficult-to-reach mountainous areas.The crane has already completed its first job, which involved making full use of its four-tonne maximum lifting capacity. The crane lifted stair elements weighing almost four tonnes for a building extension in the Swiss municipality of Giswil, in the canton of Obwalden – a typical assignment for the Liebherr 34 K fast-erecting crane, which is mainly used for residential construction projects. Its impressive flexibility enables it to cover a broad spectrum of scenarios ranging from the construction of single-family homes and apartment buildings all the way to exclusive villas. The crane can also be found working on the construction of commercial premises and infrastructure projects. With a hook height of up to 26 metres, it’s suited to projects with a building height of up to approx. 20 metres. A somewhat more unusual job for the 34 K involved working on one of the tallest buildings in the Benelux region. . Fun facts and special features of the 34 KFun fact: If all 2,000 Liebherr fast-erecting cranes were stacked on top of each other, it would create a hypothetical hook height of approx. 50 kilometres. This would reach into the outer stratosphere, way beyond where planes are able to fly and where only space rockets can go any higher. Or, to put it another way: it’s the same height as taking the six largest mountains in the world, and stacking the 8,000 metre-high giants on top of each other.When the crane was first developed, it was ahead of its time and equipped with functions that are still in demand today. Its eleven different hook heights (12.7 m to 39.0 m) and three different jib lengths (25.5 m, 30 m, 33 m) give the 34 K great flexibility. They also make it possible to slew over other cranes on site and for the crane to be used close to adjacent buildings without problems arising.In addition, the crane’s frequency converter technology enables sensitive, precise operation. Assembly engineers are pretty satisfied with the crane as well; as jib assembly takes place high above ground, it can be unfolded over the top of any potential obstacles. Because the crane is extremely compact to transport, it can be used on space-restricted construction sites and if things get too tight, e.g. when an archway is involved, the jib can be dismantled to address this..

Liebherr fast-erecting crane 34 K at work on the tallest building in the Benelux region,Press releases |08/06/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-fast-erecting-crane-34-k-at-work-on-the-tallest-building-in-the-benelux-region.html?page=59,"The Liebherr 34 K crane, part of the rental fleet of Netherlands-based crane specialist Van der Spek Vianen B.V., had been commissioned to work on the tallest building in the Benelux region by customer Civiele technieken deBoer bv. An overhead crane had been used to lift the bottom-slewing crane 190 metres into the air, where the roof of a lifting platform was dismantled.Find out more",Press releases,08/06/2021,"The unique architectural landscape of the Dutch port city of Rotterdam laid at its feet: The 34 K, one of Liebherr’s fast-erecting cranes, was in operation at one of the tallest residential towers in Europe this summer, the Zalmhaven I. The De Zalmhaven development project along the Maas in Rotterdam’s Scheepvaartkwartier district is taking shape.Construction has been under way since November 2018 near the city’s Erasmus Bridge. De Zalmhaven has three towers in total, of which Zalmhaven I is the tallest with its height of 215 metres. The other two tower blocks, Zalmhaven II and III, are identical in height, measuring in at 70 metres.Designed by architectural firms Dam & Partners and KAAN Architects, the project encompasses 452 apartments and penthouses, 33 town houses, a multi-storey car park, offices, commercial space, a roof garden and a restaurant with views of the Rotterdam skyline. The development is scheduled for completion in 2022.. A hook height of 20 metresA Liebherr 34 K fast-erecting crane with a hook height of 20 metres had been in place on the roof of what will eventually be the restaurant since mid-June. Its job, working at a height of 190 metres, was to dismantle part of the lifting platform, which had been used during the construction of Zalmhaven I.The lifting platform extended upwards along with the tower, level by level, and was practically a moving workshop in which the engineers were able to work as they would do on the ground. Because of this concept, the Zalmhaven I site had so far managed without the use of a tower crane. But things changed with the assembly of the 34 K, which was operated via remote control.. Preparation using 3D simulationIt was the question of how the lifting platform’s roof could be dismantled without considerable repositioning that prompted this assignment with a view. The customer Civiele technieken deBoer bv was looking for a crane with a suitable reach. But how a crane could be assembled in such a confined space in the first place also had to be addressed.The crux of the matter was that the crane needed to fit inside the lifting platform structure. Engineers used a 3D simulation ahead of time to calculate how this could best be achieved and which parameters needed adjusting and how. An extra issue was that the space between the platform base and the overhead crane was extremely tight for a crane assembly.The longest possible reach but also as compact as possible – the solution to this challenge was a 34 K from Liebherr. Crane rental company Van der Spek Vianen B.V. recommended the fast-erecting crane to customer CT De Boer as an efficient and straightforward solution.. Logistical challengeMeasuring 3.5 metres in height when folded, the crane is small enough to fit into the platform structure. And with a jib length of 30 metres, it is large enough to be able to dismantle the roof without time-consuming relocations. With this information to hand, alternative lifting solutions were consequently discarded. The roof parts to be removed weighed between 1,200 and 1,500 kilograms.Although the experts were faced with a logistical challenge regarding assembly, this did in fact go smoothly thanks to extensive preparation. First of all, the overhead crane, which is a part of the lifting platform system, lifted ballast weighing more than 17 tonnes. This was followed by the 34 K, weighing in at 15 tonnes. The overhead crane is capable of lifting up to 23 tonnes at a time.. Automatic unfolding of the craneThe following day, the ballast was mounted and the crane unfolded itself above the rooftops of the Dutch port city. In contrast to a top-slewing crane, the fast-erecting crane assembles and disassembles itself without additional aid. It was positioned where the platform is open at the top so that the crane, including the jib, could protrude above the roof. Its dimensions mean the crane fitted perfectly through the gap in the roof of the structure. When the assignment was completed in mid-July, the overhead crane returned the 34 K to the ground.Once again, the K series impressed with its adaptability and flexibility. Designed primarily for projects such as the construction of single-family homes and apartment buildings as well as for industrial projects of various sizes, the 34 K found itself working on the tallest skyscraper in the Netherlands; an assignment that had its own particular appeal due to the extraordinary height involved..

Time-tested concept – Max Bögl Group takes delivery of another Liebherr LTR 1220 telescopic crawler crane ,Press releases |08/05/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/time-tested-concept-max-boegl-group-takes-delivery-of-another-liebherr-ltr-1220-telescopic-crawler-crane.html?page=59,"The Max Bögl Group based in Sengenthal is convinced of the telescopic crawler crane concept. As a result of its good experience with Liebherr machines in the 100 and 220 tonne class, the Bavarian company has now purchased another LTR 1220. It particularly shows its strengths in the assembly of prefabricated concrete components. The crane’s short set-up time on site was another key point behind the decision.Find out more",Press releases,08/05/2021,"Herbert Wieseckl, Group Leader of the Technical Machines Department at Max Bögl, explains: “The concept of the Liebherr telescopic crane has proven itself. We run several LTR 1100 and LTR 1220 cranes. We are delighted with how quickly they can be moved on site. The cranes are perfectly designed for the economical assembly of prefabricated concrete components, such as columns, girders and floors, and deliver some significant benefits compared to lattice boom cranes. For building logistics centres, for example, the floors may be installed and the LTR can nevertheless drive under them because it can retract its telescopic boom. That is simply not possible for a lattice boom crane.”. High flexibility and good off-road handlingThe LTR 1220 combines the advantages of a telescopic crane with those of a crawler crane. The crawler travel gear delivers outstanding off-road handling as well as manoeuvrability with excellent handling. In addition, the full load can be moved with the crane. The advantages of the telescopic crane over a lattice boom crane include the shorter set-up times, simpler transport and the variability of the boom system.The 60 metre telescopic boom on the LR 1220 can be extended and retracted to the required length quickly and fully automatically. This allows the machine to be driven under obstacles, for example. The telescopic crawler crane also enables large loads to be telescoped using the boom, a feature which is simply not possible with lattice booms. Since, unlike a mobile crane, a crawler crane does not need to be supported it can be relocated on the site quickly and is immediately ready for use again. Economical transport and erectionIn addition to the fact that it is very easy to use and provides excellent visibility with its multiple cameras, Herbert Wieseckl also praises the fast set-up time of the LTR 1220: “Both the clearance height and clearance width when supporting the basic machine are designed so that the trailer can travel underneath the crane for attachment. The crawler carriers and the entire crane can then be erected on site very quickly.”The crane is self-erecting. The basic machine is moved to the site on a flat-bed trailer and is then supported on the jack-up cylinders. The central ballast, cross carrier, crawler carrier and turntable ballast are installed without an auxiliary crane.The undercarriage of the LTR 1220 is hydraulically telescoped from the track carrier width of 4.5 m to the intermediate width of 5.88 m or the maximum width of 7.25 m. There are load charts in the LICCON control system for all three crawler widths. On uneven ground, the LTR 1220 can operate at all three widths, and even at a lateral angle of up to 4°, a feature which is also supported by the LICCON control system..

In the coming years, the cranes, which excel through their reliability and high operating speeds, will be used for power generation in the region. Another three cranes of the same type will be commissioned in West Africa for handling bauxite.Find out more",Press releases,08/05/2021,"Handling and transporting 100 million tonnes of cargo in 25 years: that is the goal of the NS2 project of Oldendorff Carriers, Germany´s largest bulk shipping company. To achieve this, Oldendorff Carriers' fleet will work with Liebherr floating cranes. The core of the North Vietnamese project is the power plant´s 2 x 600 megawatt power generation units, which supply the region with energy. The CBG-series ensures a continuous turnover of material for the power plant's operation. The deployed cranes are characterised by their long service life and low maintenance requirements, which are a decisive advantage especially on the open seas and in remote areas.Long-term partnershipLiebherr and Oldendorff Carriers can look back on decades of cooperation based on partnership and trust. Like Liebherr, Oldendorff Carriers is a family-owned company that has been operating successfully on the market for many years. For the large-scale project to supply energy to North Vietnam, they were looking for a low-maintenance handling solution. ""Oldendorff Carriers values the reliability of Liebherr products and is therefore also counting on high-performance Liebherr four-rope grab cranes, type CBG 360, for this major project,"" said Jan Breckling, Senior Sales Manager for transshipment and ship cranes at Liebherr Maritime Cranes, “the CBG is a heavy-duty crane designed for continuous operation. The new equipment will therefore play a crucial and at the same time permanent role in our customer's long-term transshipment project."". Extended action radiusEach of the four CBG 360 floating cranes is installed on a 10-metre-long eccentric platform. This allows an extended operating radius of 46 metres for a lifting capacity of 30 tons. The maximum lifting capacity of 36 tons can be utilized at up to 40 metres. The improved positioning and outreach creates more operational flexibility and makes the unloading of the cargo holds even more efficient.Captain Johannes van Dijk, Technical Director Projects at Oldendorff Carriers, said: “We needed a robust, reliable cargo handling system for our project in North Vietnam. For that reason, we chose Liebherr CBG 360 cranes, which are high-performance cranes designed for continuous operation.”The first transloader, “Calypso”, with two CBG 360 cranes went into service at the beginning of 2021 and start of work coincides with Oldendorff Carriers' 100th company anniversary. Like its sister vessel, it has a length of 145 metres and a deadweight capacity of 18,000 tonnes. In West Africa, the “Albert Oldendorff” with three CBG 360 is in operation for bauxite handling. This transshipment vessel is equipped with hoppers and a conveyor system, which leads to a faster turnover of the material. The cranes are installed side-mounted and directly discharge into the hopper conveyer belt system.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr in Ehingen switches to climate-neutral HVO fuel,Press releases |08/02/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-in-ehingen-switches-to-climate-neutral-hvo-fuel.html?page=60,"From September 2021, Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH will power its mobile and crawler cranes exclusively using pure HVO fuel. HVO fuels which comply with standard EN 15940 with a base of hydrated vegetable oils and other synthetic fuels produced using renewable energies can make a valuable contribution to reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases. All Liebherr engines up to the 560 KW power class are approved for operation with HVO.Find out more",Press releases,08/02/2021,"Modern HVO is a synthetic fuel manufactured mainly from vegetable and animal oil and fat waste from the food industry. This is converted into hydrocarbons by adding hydrogen. HVO is an abbreviation which stands for hydrogenated vegetable oils. The major benefit of HVO is that using it as a fuel instead of fossil diesel is essentially CO2-neutral. In the future, this fuel will be used in all Liebherr mobile and crawler cranes. One of Liebherr’s main focus is to ensure, in partnership with its HVO suppliers and manufacturers, that no foodstuffs, particularly palm oil, are used in the production of its HVO.. Liebherr mobile and crawler cranes – ready for action with HVOThe conversion from fossil diesel to HVO fuel will apply to the crane acceptance procedure and test drives as well as to the initial fuelling of cranes before delivery. Over the last few months, Liebherr has been working on preparing its entire range of mobile and crawler cranes for use with HVO. For this purpose, the diesel engines were first checked, certified and approved by the manufacturers. The cranes have also undergone extensive testing and trials with pure HVO by customers and in the company’s own Test Department.Dr. Ulrich Hamme, Managing Director Design and Development at Liebherr in Ehingen comments: “If we consider the entire life-cycle of a crane from cradle to grave, including its production, CO2 emissions from a five-axle crane using HVO fall by 74 percent compared to a crane powered by diesel. This was shown in a study and calculation carried out by business consultancy Frontier Economics. This is an important step in reducing CO2 emissions.” The main reduction in CO2 emissions is during the operating phase – which is particularly significant for Liebherr cranes due to their high quality and the resultant long service life. To achieve the maximum possible CO2 reductions, the crane must be powered permanently using pure HVO.. HVO is also an alternative fuel for existing fleetsHVO and synthetic fuels made using renewable energy sources are an interesting concept for Liebherr as they are suitable for use in existing machines right now. Liebherr attaches a great deal of value to the durability of its products. Alternative fuel types such as HVO enable older Liebherr machines with internal combustion engines to be operated in essentially climate-neutral form. For all Liebherr engines up to the 560 KW power class, for example, they are approved for operation with HVO. In Europe, but also in Asia, Africa or South America, lots of machines with internal combustion engines continue in use for a great many years and therefore also affect our climate. As HVO can be added to fossil diesel fuel in any ratio and used with conventional internal combustion engines, most of these machines in existing fleets all over the world can in fact be powered effectively with HVO right away. The CO2 saving is reduced accordingly with a lower HVO content in the fuel mixture.. Reductions in CO2 emissions by using HVO in vehicle at the plant in Ehingen Liebherr has also analysed all of its plant transport vehicles at the Ehingen site. The results show that the fleet can also be powered by HVO with a few exceptions. Liebherr is therefore planning to switch these vehicles to the climate-neutral fuel in the near future.“As a result, we will be able to save 2.5 million litres of fossil diesel per year by switching to HVO fuel. That will mean an annual reduction of around 6500 tonnes of CO2”, is how Heusel describes the expected result of the action at Liebherr’s Ehingen plant.One of the challenges, in part, is the practicability and availability of alternative fuels. “To make HVO or other synthetic fuels attractive for crane operators, they must be available nationwide and in plentiful quantities at filling stations, as is the case today with diesel. That will not be possible from one day to the next. But Liebherr is making a start, and we are hopeful that it will have a signal effect”, says Hamme.Production Director at Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH, Ulrich Heusel, continues: “Germany has included synthetic, paraffin-based fuels, which do not yet comply with EN 15940 (XTL), in its regulations relating to the quality of fuels. This is why HVO is not yet available at the filling station network. HVO is available at public filling stations for road vehicles in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium as an additive for fossil diesel fuel or in pure form.”.

Bruns Kranvermietung based in Lüneburg takes delivery of its first Liebherr mobile crane,Press releases |07/27/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/bruns-kranvermietung-based-in-lueneburg-takes-delivery-of-its-first-liebherr-mobile-crane.html?page=60,"Bruns Kranvermietung GmbH based in Lüneburg has taken delivery of its first Liebherr mobile crane, an LTM 1070-4.2. The mobility, flexibility and technical innovations on the Liebherr 70 tonne crane persuaded the company to buy it. Simpler driving permits with a 10 tonne axle load and the VarioBase® variable supporting base were major criteria behind the northern German company ordering its first mobile crane from Liebherr.Find out more",Press releases,07/27/2021,"A. Keck from Bruns Kranvermietung said: “The fact that the LTM 1070-4.2 can be driven with an axle load of just 10 tonnes delivers enormous benefits because we now face significant licensing conditions in the rural area around our company base for the usual 12 tonne axle load on mobile cranes.”In mobile crane development, Liebherr focuses on meeting different axle load requirements in order to be able to be economically mobile worldwide. In fact, even in countries and areas where mobile cranes with a 12 tonne axle load are permitted on the roads, crane operators have for some time been demanding cranes which can be driven with 10 tonnes per axle by simply removing the ballast. This version delivers major benefits for obtaining licences and route permits.The LTM 1070-4.2 can carry 10.7 tonnes of ballast and its double folding jib with an axle load of 12 tonnes, whilst it can still carry 3.8 tonnes of counterweights with a 10 tonne axle load. That enables it to carry out a whole host of crane jobs because with the boom fully raised its lifting capacity is hardly affected, even with reduced ballast.. State of the art crane technologyLiebherr originally launched the 70 tonne crane with its 50 metre telescopic boom with the model name LTM 1070-4.1. New technical features such as speed-dependent rear axle steering, disc brakes and the new LICCON2 controller were added in 2008 and the model name was changed to LTM 1070-4.2. Afterwards Liebherr continuously updated the model to keep it up with the state of the art in mobile crane technology. For example, technical innovations such as VarioBase®, ECOmode, new crane cabs, new one-piece steel wheel rims and the latest generation of disc brakes have been added to it. More than 2000 cranes of this model have now been delivered by Liebherr to customers all over the world.“Liebherr’s VarioBase® has an excellent reputation in the industry and is a pioneer among systems which enable cranes to operate safely with a reduced supporting base. That was a strong argument in favour of us buying from Liebherr. It enables us to react flexibly to a wide range of situations on sites. What is more, VarioBase® actually makes the crane more powerful if it can operate immediately above the outriggers”, said Keck.The operators, who received general and induction training on the new crane at the actual Liebherr plant in Ehingen, are full of praise for their new tool. Keck summed up their impressions: “Liebherr does a great deal for the crane operators. Everything is very comfortable, including the premium, air-conditioned seats. The driver's cab is very spacious and the crane cab delivers superb all-round visibility – a whole new level for operators. Setting up the crane using the BTT control console and its simple extension to complete remote control are unique.”. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

On the road to the digital transformation in production: Liebherr collaborating with startup ,News |07/14/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/on-the-road-to-the-digital-transformation-in-production-liebherr-collaborating-with-startup.html?page=61,"Liebherr is actively involved in a development program for startups that is being run by Bosch: The Bosch Startup Harbour. The purpose is to support talented teams in the development of their first business concept. Liebherr's collaboration with Bosch is aimed at shaping the factory of the future together with a startup on the basis of a specific application. At the same time, Liebherr sees this new collaboration format as an opportunity to gain external input and for testing and validating new technologies. This should accelerate the innovation process.Find out more",News,07/14/2021,"In February this year, Bosch and Liebherr launched the Co-Innovation Challenge with an appeal on social media. With the aim of shaping the factory of the future together, several startups applied with their innovations for three areas of interest defined by Liebherr in the context of the digital transformation in production. Liebherr ultimately decided to enter a collaboration with Continuum-Innovation, a young startup from Berlin. The six-strong team impressed us with its ""Cobot"" innovation, a collaborative robot arm that allows simple and low-threshold automation. What makes it so special: The arm and the gripper mechanism were modelled on an elephant's trunk. It uses visual sensors to monitor its surroundings, which gives the Cobot great flexibility and versatility in a wide range of different applications in production.. Since early May 2021, the collaboration has been running between Liebherr, Bosch and the startup Continuum-Innovation. In addition to a monthly bounty, the young startup will receive extensive training and individually tailored coaching and mentoring from Bosch for the duration of the program, which will be about six months. The contents should help the startup to develop a solid business model for its innovation. In addition, the startup will also be given direct points of contact to science and thus opportunities for an exchange with a large network of researchers at the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin, another cooperation partner of the Bosch Startup Harbour. The program is financially supported by the State of Berlin and the ESF (European Social Fund).. Liebherr is supporting and mentoring the startup in co-innovation with the conceptual development of its product innovation. To this end, workshops are planned with experts from the Earthmoving product segment. Here, the Cobot will be tested and optimised with the help of simulations on the basis of a specific application – the bolting of the slew ring on a wheeled excavator. For Liebherr, the co-innovation represents a new collaboration format. Besides the goal of developing a collaborative, working robot together with Continuum-Innovation, Liebherr sees the cooperation as an opportunity to gain new know-how through an exchange with specialists from science and research. These new working methods and technologies will bring Liebherr a step closer to the factory of the future."
Two top class models – column loaded by Liebherr tandem hoist,Press releases |07/13/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/two-top-class-models-column-loaded-by-liebherr-tandem-hoist.html?page=61,"A new Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 met up with its predecessor, the LTM 1500-8.1 (over 600 of which were manufactured) recently to load an enormous column in the River Rhine port of Andernach. Together, the two 8-axle cranes placed the 43 metre steel cylinder on a barge.Find out more",Press releases,07/13/2021,"“Everything has gone like clockwork up to now.” Marco Flossdorf, Managing Representative at Dietmar Flossdorf GmbH & Co. KG sums it up perfectly. The crane contractor based in Bad Neuenahr has now been working with its new LTM 1650-8.1 mobile crane for over three months. “Since then, we have used our new Liebherr mobile crane for bridge building, in refineries and to erect large silos,” says Flossdorf. For several weeks, the powerful mobile crane has been working at wind farms in East Germany, dismantling wind turbines. “It’s a powerful crane and really versatile. It makes us very flexible,” says a delighted Flossdorf. The company’s steadily growing fleet now comprises around 20 cranes. In addition to the new large crane, an LTM 1110-5.1 was also purchased from the Liebherr Plant in Ehingen. Marco Flossdorf: “We are adding two more at the end of the year. From Liebherr, of course.”. At the end of May the heavy load experts at Flossdorf received an order to load an enormous CO2 washer, a column over 40 metres in length, onto a barge at Andernach am Rhein. Another crane was required to handle the 140 tonne load. Working with the LTM 1500-8.1 from Autokrane Schares GmbH meant that the predecessor and successor of this crane class from Liebherr were working together on the quayside. The 500 tonne crane has been in production for over twenty years. The very final model left the production line at the factory in Ehingen during the last few days. With over 600 units, the LTM 1500-8.1 is the most successful large crane in this class.. Up to 70 percent increase in lifting capacity compared to its predecessor The two cranes managed the tandem job on the banks of the River Rhine in Andernach smoothly. During the job, the different quantities of slewing platform ballast made the technical progress made by the Liebherr crane developers very plain – for the gross load case of around 77 tonnes, which each of the cranes had to hoist at a radius of twenty metres, the LTM 1500-8.1 required ballast slabs with a gross weight of 165 tonnes on its slewing platform. Thorsten Mahlberg, the crane operator in the modern successor, set the ballast radius on his crane to its maximum distance using the hydraulic slewing mechanism, meaning that it only needed 125 tonnes of counterweight. That meant that 40 tonnes, in other words almost one-quarter of the ballast, did not have to be transported to the site at all. The imposing lifting capacities of the LTM 1650-8.1 catapult the performance parameters for many of its configurations upwards. On average, the new crane delivers an impressive 30 percent more lifting capacity than its predecessor and demonstrates its incredible power with its long boom which requires no guying in many settings – enabling it to increase the values by up to 70 percent. In many areas, the new crane, which is bursting with power, even matches the lifting capacity table values used by the nine-axle LTM 1750-9.1. This delivers very large logistical and monetary benefits for customers, as many jobs can be completed without the use of telescope guying..

Transnacional adds used LTM 1500-8.1 to its crane fleet,Press releases |07/12/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/transnacional-adds-used-ltm-1500-8-1-to-its-crane-fleet.html?page=61,"Crane and passenger transport contractor Transnacional has taken delivery of a used Liebherr LTM 1500-8.1 mobile crane. The 8-axle 500 tonne crane was supplied by Liebherr-Ibérica, S.L from Spain to the company based in the north-east of Brazil. The versatility of the LTM 1500-8.1 and the company’s deep confidence in the Liebherr brand were the main criteria behind the decision.Find out more",Press releases,07/12/2021,"Transnacional has been in business in Brazil for over 35 years. A wide-ranging crane fleet is enabling the company to expand its areas of work to the wind power industry. Transnational has already had plenty of good experience with Liebherr LTM 1500-8.1 all-terrain crane and was therefore looking for another Liebherr 500 tonne crane to add to its fleet. Liebherr was able to offer a used crane of this type and therefore react quickly to the enquiry.“Our team has been using the LTM 1500-8.1 in various markets for around 15 years”, says Napoleão Luna, Commercial Director at Transnacional. “We can offer our customers bespoke solutions in view of its wide range of configurations, the ability to move the fully erected crane and its high lifting capacities. That makes the LTM 1500-8.1 an outstanding machine for Transnacional.”. Used crane proves to be a good alternativeWhen the company contacted Liebherr, it was looking for an affordable LTM 1500 8.1 with a short delivery time. Liebherr therefore suggested the purchase of a second-hand crane that offered the desired performance, durability and reliability and could also be delivered quickly.Liebherr Brasil then found the ideal crane for its customer at Liebherr-Ibérica S.L. in Spain. “Our aim is to satisfy our customers’ needs. Access to the global Liebherr sales and service network for used machines opens up a whole new range of opportunities”, says Rene Porto, Mobile and Crawler Cranes Division Manager at Liebherr in Brazil.Liebherr’s global network makes it possible to look for cranes all over the world so that we can offer customers an ideal solution. “The lower cost of a used crane, particularly in view of the current exchange rates in our country, are a great advantage for our customers”, continues Porto. “Not only does Liebherr sell used cranes, but it can also value customers’ existing cranes on site so that they can be used in part exchange for a new crane. We also have a modern and complete service engineering area to serve our customers, prepared to carry out repairs or complete overhauls on the cranes.”. LTM 1500-8.1 is suitable for a wide range of possible usesDiscussing his company’s latest purchase, Napoleão Luna says: “We bought the crane with a complete configuration. We are mainly focused on the market for renewable energies, particularly projects involving the installation of new wind farms and for maintenance and repair work on wind turbines. As our crane operators are already familiar with the LTM 1500-8.1, we are well prepared for these types of jobs. They can be very complex as a result of the altitude, loads and the strength of the wind. Thanks to the machine's versatility, we also already have enquiries from customers in the mining, oil and gas and industrial plant maintenance sectors.”Napoleão Luna points out that in addition to the versatility of the LTM 1500-8.1 and the company’s familiarity with this crane model, the reliability and safety of Liebherr cranes, the company’s good relationship with the after sales team at Liebherr Brasil and the ready availability of spare parts were also major criteria behind the decision to choose Liebherr. “And our decision has proven to be absolutely correct to date – despite the difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Liebherr Brasil and Liebherr-Ibérica kept all their promises, which always seemed to be in jeopardy, even when faced with a snowstorm which hit Spain very hard right in the middle of the delivery process. Nevertheless, we received the crane and all the equipment in excellent condition. So now we are looking forward to the next step in our partnership with Liebherr, which will probably see us purchase another large crane in the near future.”Transnacional was founded over 35 years ago in Fortaleza in the north-east of Brazil by Julio Cesar Mourão, the company’s current Chairman. Originally, the company was focused on passenger transport. When looking for ways to diversify the business and put it on a more professional footing, Transnacional also started to invest in crane rental. The company now has a strong presence in both segments and by implementing quality, safety and environmental controls, it has become a benchmark company on the Brazilian market..

Everything remote: Distance not an issue for Liebherr,Press releases |07/08/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/everything-remote-distance-not-an-issue-for-liebherr.html?page=61,Remote products are the topic of the hour and due to the Covid-19 pandemic in greater demand than ever. All the better that the Liebherr Group has been working for a long time on such innovative solutions and is able to offer its customers appropriate products for various applications – for remote maintenance as well as for collaboration with local technicians.Find out more,Press releases,07/08/2021,"The coronavirus pandemic has given the digital transformation extraordinary impetus over the last year, demonstrating that there most certainly are solutions for performing work without being present on site. Such remote applications have many benefits and are currently experiencing a veritable boom. Liebherr has been working for many years on various remote products, now allowing the company to make use of these and to further expand its innovative technologies. Besides the application examples listed below, Liebherr also offers different solutions covering all product lines for making daily work easier and more efficient.Remote maintenance at the push of a buttonLiebherr's Remote Service app is especially well suited as a diagnosis tool for repairs or for remote maintenance on cranes, excavators and construction machines. It can be used around the world in real time and can transmit visual information, allowing fast and efficient customer support when it is needed. Liebherr also offers remote diagnostics for its cranes of the latest generation. If a problem occurs, a service engineer would connect to the crane control via an encrypted mobile phone connection. So they could support the customer by troubleshooting the issue. Both remote tools allow issues with the machine to be identified more quickly, avoiding unnecessary journeys for maintenance – an especially important factor in times of corona and travel restrictions. Precise fault diagnosis allows the correct parts to be ordered so that the crawler crane, rope excavator, maritime crane, deep foundation machine or mobile crane can quickly be put back into operation.. Smart glasses for the right perspectiveSmart glasses are a practical tool for providing fast assistance to customers in faraway places without having to send a technician around straight away. The glasses allow pictures to be simply shared and discussed. So this remote tool not only avoids the need for travel, but also saves substantial costs and makes customer service more efficient.Liebherr is also testing this capability in its internal engineering and production in the Aerospace division. Virtual and augmented reality allows final inspections to be performed on a landing gear assembly using these glasses. In this case, the 3D model is superimposed on reality, enabling the inspector to examine the machine virtually ""live"" and to improve the quality inspection process.Liebherr also uses smart glasses for earthmoving machines and material handling technology. This enables digital remote support for service and maintenance cases: the customer wears the smart glasses and a live image is transmitted directly to a Liebherr service technician. They then carry out a fault diagnosis and, ideally, find a solution to the problem.. Controlling container cranes from the officeLiebherr's Remote Operator Station (ROS) has been developed for use with all Liebherr container crane products and offers flexibility in operations. The ROS is ergonomically designed and fitted with multiple displays allowing the operator to perform all normal driving functions from a remote office environment. Furthermore, the move to automation with remote control brings operational benefits, with a single ROS operator being able to operate several cranes simultaneously. Additional benefits include faster and easier shift changes, and a more attractive work environment for employees.. Mobility of the futureBesides construction and logistics, Liebherr is also active in the field of rail vehicle technology, where it develops remote solutions. The Train Control and Monitoring System (TCMS) allows Liebherr real-time access to its various subsystems. In regular travel operation, the system states are monitored and intervention is also possible from the development location during servicing. At the same time, the system can be used to monitor the control response in a test environment for the customer, e.g. for air-conditioning systems. This enables customers in product development to actuate the air conditioning equipment at a Liebherr location from anywhere in the world and test various operational situations in combination with other systems on the train – totally without costly time spent on site.Liebherr story: New digital ways forward.

In the past year the company purchased 30 earthmoving machines, including nine Liebherr wheeled excavators of the same type. The machines are to be used in the future for large-scale projects in Nigeria. The acceptance of the first five machines of the current order recently took place in Kirchdorf an der Iller.Find out more",News,07/08/2021,"Due to the positive experience with the Liebherr wheeled excavators already deployed in Nigeria, the company decided on another large order. The machines have an operating weight of around 21,000 kilograms with an engine power of 129 kW / 175 hp in exhaust emissions category IIIA. High digging performances, high lift capacities and fast work cycles make them essential assistants in everyday construction site operation. Thanks to their mobile undercarriage and the good driving characteristics, the machines can be moved quickly and easily on the construction site. The robust undercarriage concept with stabiliser blade at the front, as well as support lugs at the rear, ensure secure positioning and high stability during applications even with full loads. The upper carriage concept with its optimal maintenance accessibility, the harmonised Liebherr hydraulic system and the powerful construction machine engine also impressed the customer.Julius Berger International GmbH and Julius Berger Nigeria Plc form the core of the Julius Berger Group, whose core technologies are in the construction and repair of diverse and complex civil engineering works. Some of the large-scale projects in Nigeria are construction projects with international importance. They include, for example, the upgrading and extension of the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Road, one of the most important road network connections in the country, or the infrastructure project ""Second River Niger Bridge"" in Asaba, which should eliminate the traffic congestion that passes over the Niger River.""In order to be able to successfully execute large-scale projects in Nigeria, we resorted to searching for reliable and powerful wheeled excavators"", says Peter Leuschner from Julius Berger International GmbH. Other criteria in the purchase decision were that the wheeled excavators can be used in diverse applications and at the same time are productive and efficient in everyday construction site operation."
Liebherr joins eFuel Alliance,News |07/07/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-joins-efuel-alliance.html?page=62,"Liebherr joined the eFuel Alliance e.V. on 1st of June 2021.

As the first representative from the off-highway sector, Liebherr, together with more than 135 companies and associations, is pursuing the goal of promoting the production and broad acceptance of eFuels as an alternative fuel in order to make a joint contribution to climate protection. Liebherr's membership demonstrates the Group's technology-open and future-oriented approach to research, development and promotion of alternative drive concepts.According to the EU's most recent climate protection programme from December 2020, the EU's internal greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990. Wherever vehicles or machines are used, the question of efficient and climate-neutral drives is currently being raised. Sustainable fuels are playing an increasingly important role, including eFuels, which are produced on the basis of electricity from renewable energy sources, water and carbon dioxide and can already be used in conjunction with existing combustion engines. The eFuel Alliance is working for greater acceptance and promotion of climate-neutral and thus promising synthetic fuels.Open approach to technology: Liebherr conducts research on alternative drive conceptsThe construction industry, and therefore Liebherr, is faced with the challenge of how mobile machinery and heavy-duty machines can be powered in the future in order to guarantee a contribution to achieving the EU climate targets. The enormous range of applications areas and fields of use of Liebherr construction machinery requires an equally large variance of suitable drives in order to best meet the needs of customers and the environmental demands. Depending on the type and location of use, a number of other alternative concepts are also possible in addition to electric drives in order to sustainably reduce emissions and promote climate neutrality on construction sites in the long term.Liebherr in the eFuel Alliance: Establishing and promoting climate-neutral electric fuelsClimate-friendly solutions that customers can already use today in conjunction with existing drives play a special role for Liebherr - for example, synthetic fuels that can drive conventional combustion engines in the form of admixtures or as pure fuels. This also includes eFuels that are produced using electricity, water and carbon dioxide (CO2). The electricity is obtained from renewable energy sources such as solar energy, wind energy or hydropower. The CO2 comes directly from the atmosphere or from industrial waste gases.The eFuel Alliance, with offices in Berlin, Germany, and Brussels, Belgium, took on the task of establishing and promoting these synthetic fuels based on renewable energies as a contribution to climate protection and thus helping them to be used worldwide. In doing so, the eFuel Alliance also aims to bring the advantages and benefits of eFuels to the attention of science, politics, authorities, the public and the media and to introduce eFuels into decision-making processes and debates. Currently, more than 135 companies, institutions, associations and individuals along the entire value chain belong to the association.Further information on the eFuel Alliance can be found here: Home - eFuel Alliance"
"1,300 maritime cranes – from Rostock to the world",Press releases |07/07/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/1-300-maritime-cranes-%E2%80%93-from-rostock-to-the-world.html?page=62,"Since the start of production in 2005, Liebherr-MCCtec Rostock GmbH has manufactured and delivered over 1,000 maritime cranes. Today, the numerous mobile harbour, ship and offshore cranes are in use in over 100 countries on all continents. Now the 1,300th crane has left the Rostock premises to its destination in Ghana.Find out more",Press releases,07/07/2021,"Slowly, ship cranes on the heavy-lift vessel BBC-Russia raise the new machine over the quay edge. The LHM 550 is one of two Liebherr mobile harbour cranes that will begin the 5,500-kilometre journey to Ghana. On receiving their new machines, the West African Port of Tema is expanding its fleet of cranes for container handling. This delivery marks the eighth mobile harbour crane from Rostock to the port operator: Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA).""We have a longstanding partnership with Liebherr. We are impressed with both Liebherr products and their service. It is not only the individual consulting but also the fast delivery that has promoted an expansion and increase of our business,"" says Ing. Stephen Kwamina Owiah, Port Logistics Manager GPHA.The berths next to the Liebherr factory in Rostock's port are accessible to ships with a draught of up to 13 metres and are free from shipping obstacles such as locks and bridges. The factory’s direct connection to the Baltic Sea makes it possible to load the fully assembled cranes, in working order. As such, the two machines boarding the BBC-Russia are timeously ready for use after arrival at the port of destination.""The Rostock international port offers us ideal conditions for shipping the often large-dimensioned equipment. We now load 60-65 percent of the cranes in fully assembled condition,"" says Gregor Levold, General Manager - Shipping and Heavy Lift Handling at Liebherr-MCCtec Rostock GmbH.An experienced team makes use of various loading options when shipping the cranes. An example is the roll on/roll off (RoRo) procedure on board special ships, which enables the machines to travel independently from the quay onto the vessel. The loading onto the BBC-Russia is being carried out in the lift on/lift off (LoLo) procedure. The LoLo procedure involves cargo being lifted up onto the ship using on-board cranes. However, road freight also offers advantages for many customers due to the immediate proximity of the Liebherr factory to the German motorway network.. World market leader in mobile harbour cranesIt is not only the good infrastructural links that ensure the success of Liebherr-MCCtec Rostock GmbH. One of the reasons Liebherr has been the world market leader of mobile harbour cranes for over ten years is their commitment to high customer satisfaction. Through worldwide customer service Liebherr takes care of customer machines, even in times of crisis, to ensure that ports are able to provide supplies to their people. Despite the worldwide lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Liebherr mobile harbour cranes remained functional in ports across the world.""More than 1,000 colleagues are close to our customers every day in our numerous service companies around the world. Together we are continuously developing our cranes,"" says Andreas Müller, Sales Director for Mobile Harbour Cranes at Liebherr-MCCtec Rostock GmbH.Innovations as a constant companionIn addition to the worldwide customer service network, it is the continuous technical development of the cranes and assistance systems that gives Liebherr's customers the decisive edge. In future, the mobile harbour crane series is set to run on the fossil-free HVO 100 diesel. The diesel reduces emissions by up to 90% and is derived from renewable raw materials. Additionally, a fundamentally revised hybrid drive for the Mobile Harbour Crane will be introduced shortly. The revision will allow users to switch between two different modes: the boost mode that provides extra power for faster handling, and the eco mode that significantly reduces fuel consumption. The future-oriented hybrid drive offers the user a high degree of flexibility.

Sand from Dubai for an experiment in Pinghu,News |07/06/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/sand-from-dubai-for-an-experiment-in-pinghu-news.html?page=62,Two Liebherr companies completed collaborative works for thorough testing of HVAC units designed for railway vehicles in the Middle East region.Find out more,News,07/06/2021,"Liebherr-Transportation Systems (China) Co., Ltd. in Pinghu has performed thorough testing on HVAC (heating-, ventilation and air conditioning) units regarding sand filtration and cooling capacity under extreme conditions for a passenger train project in the Middle East. The engineers in China were supported by the Liebherr-Aerospace and Transportation Systems team of Liebherr Middle East FZE in Dubai (U.A.E.): The team collected sand near the metropole and shipped it to Pinghu for advanced tests of the HVAC units.“Summer temperatures on the Saudi Arabian Peninsula can be extreme with the highest temperature close to 50°C. Wind and dust contribute as well to this typical desert climate. To guarantee the system’s functionality – even under extreme temperatures - and to prevent sand and dust to enter the passenger compartments, are therefore the two core challenges we are facing regarding the design and production as well as the reliability of our HVAC systems”, explains Senior System Engineer Lightman Lu at Liebherr-Transportation Systems (China), “We had to take into account that every sand consists of different particles. In order to achieve accurate and effective test data from our HVAC system, our colleagues in Dubai kindly sampled sand for us from an area close to the potential train operating site. We were thus able to simulate the actual conditions in our testing department in Pinghu.”During the test, two different types of inlet and outlet air modes of the HVAC units were examined regarding their sand removal capacity and operation reliability under extreme environmental conditions. Furthermore, the engineers took into account the HVAC systems’ service life as well as the energy consumption of other components.The test results helped the engineering team of Liebherr-Transportation Systems in China to optimize the design of the HVAC units for the benefit of potential customers in the Middle East."
“VarioBase® is the Ferrari of crane support systems”,Press releases |07/06/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/variobase-is-the-ferrari-of-crane-support-systems.html?page=62,"Hildesheim-based K&W Autokrane GmbH & CO.KG has a fleet of eight mobile cranes. To date, an LTM 1030-2.1 and a compact LTC 1050-3.1 were its only machines bearing the Liebherr logo. Now the company has ordered three LTM mobile cranes from the Ehingen-based crane manufacturer. The reason behind the change of manufacturer – the extremely successful VarioBase® crane support system.Find out more",Press releases,07/06/2021,"The first of the three ordered Liebherr mobile cranes are due to make the journey from the crane factory in Ehingen, southern Germany northwards at some point in August. It will be an LTM 1160-5.2. This 5 axle crane with lifting capacities of up to 180 tonnes will expand the portfolio of the Hildesheim-based company upwards and will be K&W’s new flagship. During the year, two additional cranes will follow in their black and yellow livery – an LTM 1110-5.1 and an LTM 1055-3.2.. Joint Managing Director Christoph Klein admits that the company’s only experience with Liebherr cranes to date has involved an LTM 1030-2.1 and the LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane. The LTC is true to its name as a compact lifting machine as it requires a minimal amount of space, particularly in adverse site conditions or in low industrial buildings. In the latter case, the powerful 3 axle crane has a short erection jib with a practical heavy duty hook. This enables it to attach loads or fastening equipment level with the jib. As a result of its design, this addition, whose angle can be adjusted, can reach a hoisting height up to just below the building roof or limiting levels – in contrast to jobs where a conventional hook block is used. This is a major benefit for installing tanks, assembling gantry cranes or positioning large machine tools. As is the telescoping elevating cab, which provides the crane operator with a perfect view at all times, ensuring a high level of safety during hoisting work.. A crane for a wide range of jobs“The LTC does everything for us,” says Klein. “From quick day jobs to long term sites to crane work inside buildings, the compact crane has been used universally by us for the last four years.” The VarioBase® system developed by Liebherr, which enables each outrigger to be extended to a different length has proven its worth in various situations, but particularly when working inside industrial buildings.This system, which is extremely popular and established within the market, has now become an essential part of crane operations. “Quite simply, VarioBase® is the Ferrari of crane support systems”, is how Christoph Klein describes the main feature behind his company’s switch to Liebherr cranes.Klein, who manages the company alongside Michael Wanjek, has crane customers within a radius of around 80 kilometres of the company’s based in Hildesheim. In addition to crane and industrial assembly work, K&W also provides heavy and special haulage services as well as recovery and towing services of all types..

A new addition to the “Tough Ones” series: The new 205 EC-B 10 Flat-Top crane from Liebherr,Press releases |07/05/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/a-new-addition-to-the-tough-ones-series-the-new-205-ec-b-10-flat-top-crane-from-liebherr.html?page=62,Liebherr launches the latest crane in the EC-B “Tough Ones” series. The 205 EC-B 10 Flat-Top crane extends the EC-B series in the 200 metre-tonne segment and closes the gap between the 172 EC-B 8 and the 220 EC-B 10.Find out more,Press releases,07/05/2021,"The 205 EC-B 10 is capable of lifting up to 2,100 kg at its head with a jib length of 65 metres and proves its strength with features such as a maximum load capacity of 10,000 kg. The new 205 EC-B 10 can operate with this maximum load capacity at full jib length with a radius of up to 18 metres. For precise site planning and increased flexibility, the jib can be graduated in 2.5 metre sections.The new Liebherr tower crane impresses with its compact design; the slewing section can be transported together with the full jib and ballast using just four transport units. As the transport units are not used to full capacity, there is also space available for tower sections or central ballast. In addition, the use of the time-tested pickaback system for counter-jib transport enables efficient, safe and economical assembly in just a few lifts.Easier assembly The 205 EC-B 10 delivers further advantages when it comes to handling. Slidable pins are used for connecting the slewing platform with the jib and counter-jib when assembling the crane’s upper section; hammering is no longer required. This ensures not only safer, but also significantly more economical and convenient crane assembly.Launched in June 2021, the 205 EC-B 10 features a 45 kW hoist unit, which offers an optimal balance between handling speed and energy consumption on the construction site. The first new 205 EC-B 10 cranes have already been sold in France and Italy.Available with LiCAB cabinWhen developing the new series, Liebherr also focused on the comfort of the crane operator and safety on the construction site; the already familiar LiCAB cabin, with its proven extensive field of vision, is once again used for the latest addition to the EC-B family.

Klema expands fleet with Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 mobile crane,Press releases |06/30/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/klema-expands-fleet-with-liebherr-ltm-1110-5-1-mobile-crane.html?page=63,Klema Kranverleih GmbH based in Oberschleissheim has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 mobile crane. The new 110-tonne model will expand the Bavarian company’s fleet. The main factors behind the decision included the high performance and great variability of the LTM 1110-5.1 in terms of axle loads and transport weight.Find out more,Press releases,06/30/2021,"Managing Director Henry Lewin explains: “We regard the new LTM 1110 5.1 as a sensible addition to our fleet, closing the gap between 100 and 130 tonnes. We decided to buy the Liebherr 110 tonne crane because its design makes it flexible on public roads, where it can carry 13.4 tonnes of ballast.”Long, powerful boom and great mobilityThe concept behind the LTM 1110-5.1 is designed to ensure it delivers high performance with a long telescopic boom along with great mobility. It has such a lightweight design that it has a gross weight of just 48 tonnes with axle loads of less than 10 tonnes. Even in countries where mobile cranes with a 12-tonne axle load are permitted on the roads, crane operators have for some time been demanding cranes which can be driven with 10 tonnes per axle by simply removing the ballast. This version delivers major benefits for obtaining licences and route permits, increasing flexibility for job planning. Despite its lightweight construction, its 60 metre telescopic boom enables the LTM 1110-5.1 to exceed the performance of comparable mobile cranes on the market.. First job with full ballast and double folding jibAt its very first job, Klema’s new LTM 1110-5.1 had to show exactly what it was made of – the maximum ballast of 29 tonnes was required to replace filter systems at Zolling power plant, around 50 kilometres north of Munich, and the crane had to be set up with its 19 metre double folding jib.Crane operator Thomas Feder is full of praise for his new machine: “It’s a great crane, fantastic handling, superb quality. The crane can be set up quickly and requires very little space. Bring on the next challenges”.A close partnership over many yearsLiebherr and Klema have a long term partnership. “Liebherr stands for quality and service, but the fact that we have had a good business relationship with the team there for many years makes our purchase decisions that much easier”, says Lewin.Klema Kranverleih GmbH first opened for business in 1965 when it bought a 6 tonne mobile crane and a forklift truck. Over the decades, this small business has developed into a modern company with more than 80 vehicles today, making it a strong partner for handling heavy loads. The company has several outlets in southern Germany.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

First job in the Netherlands – Sarens erects wind turbines using Liebherr LR 11000 crawler crane,Press releases |06/29/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/first-job-in-the-netherlands-sarens-erects-wind-turbines-using-liebherr-lr-11000-crawler-crane.html?page=63,"Global green and heavy haulage contractor Sarens, whose head office is in Wolvertem, Belgium, took delivery of a new LR 11000 crawler crane from Liebherr in the spring. For its first job, the new 1000 tonne crane was assembled at Oostpolder wind farm, which is currently being built to the south of the Dutch port of Eemshaven. Sarens received the order from there to erect Enercon E-136 EP5 wind turbines with a hub height of 155 metres.Find out more",Press releases,06/29/2021,"Sarens’ new LR 11000, featuring the very latest crawler crane equipment such as the SL10DF2BV wind power boom system, VarioTray and V-Frame, has everything it needs for erecting the 4.65 MW wind turbines in the north of the Netherlands. The heaviest component of the turbine is its generator, which weighs 120 tonnes and has to be installed on a tower around 155 metres in height. Sarens Project Manager Pascal van der Spoel explains: “We decided to purchase the LR 11000 because it has a very flexible derrick system with VarioTray and V-frame. What’s more, its boom length and capacity are ideal for the projects we have scheduled”.The special SL10DF2BV wind power boom system on the LR 11000 delivers maximum lifting capacities for the economical erection of the very latest generation of wind turbines with hub heights of up to 180 metres. For these turbines, the LR 11000 reaches a hook height of 192 metres and can hoist an impressive 110 tonnes. At the Oostpolder wind farm, Sarens assembled the new 1000 tonne crane with a 162 metre main boom and 12 metre fixed jib. This configuration enables the crane to hoist up to 156 tonnes with hook heights of up to 174 metres.. Innovative derrick ballast – VarioTray and V-FrameThe VarioTray detachable ballast pallet enables crane jobs to be completed particularly economically – after raising the lattice boom with the large derrick ballast, part of the ballast can be unbolted quickly and easily. Only a small proportion of the ballast is generally required for hoisting work with the boom fully or almost fully raised. This avoids the need for the tiresome stacking and unstacking of ballast slabs.The new V-frame ballasting system is used for the suspended ballast – a hydraulically adjustable frame enables the ballast radius to be adjusted to up to 30 metres. This means that a rigid ballast guide is no longer required for large radii.. New luffing jib based on the SL10 main boom lattice sectionsAs Sarens is a global company, it is important that its cranes can be used universally. The company therefore also ordered additional equipment for the LR 11000, which enables it to convert the wind power boom into a powerful luffing jib system for use in industrial environments.The long wind power boom contains a very large number of intermediate sections. These cannot be used in the standard luffing jib as it is designed to be lightweight and easy to transport. However, Liebherr has created a solution for using the existing lattice sections to create a particularly powerful luffing jib – the heavyweight sections of the wind power boom are used for the main boom and the slightly lighter ones for the luffing jib. Only the W assembly unit is then required as an additional module.The very strong boom with a powerful luffing jib created in this way can deliver lifting capacities close to those possible with the Powerboom combination (PDW3B system). To create the name, the “10” has been adopted from the SL10 boom – with the full combination being known as the S10DW4B. The new boom can also be used without a luffing jib in the form of the S10DB main boom which delivers excellent lifting capacities. The V-Frame is compatible with both systems..

ALL relies on two Liebherr cranes for dual pick at bridge in Cleveland ,Press releases |06/28/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/all-relies-on-two-liebherr-cranes-for-dual-pick-at-bridge-in-cleveland.html?page=63,"Building bridges is never an easy job. Especially if this bridge runs over busy railway tracks. ALL Crane, one of the largest crane rental companies in the United States, relies on Liebherr cranes to place the bridge span in an ambitious time frame. The LTM 1450-8.1 and the LTM 1250-6.1 mobile cranes were the cranes of choice for this project in Cleveland, Ohio.Find out more",Press releases,06/28/2021,"Maybe constructing a three-span pedestrian and bicycle bridge sounds easy enough. But what if it’s going over the third-busiest set of railroad tracks in the United States, with estimated traffic of 100 trains per day? In that case, you have to work closely with the railroad to get the critical work-clearance time you need to set spans. And it’s likely to be scheduled in extremely brief, single-hour increments. That would take a perfect combination of planning, materials, people, and cranes to get the job done.That was the scenario as a new hiking and biking bridge was constructed in Cleveland’s Wendy Park as part of an expansion of the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail. The 100-mile path connects Cleveland to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and cities to its south. ALL provided several pieces of equipment for the job site, including various aerials and a forklift, but the stars were the two cranes used to set bridge spans and the final arch that topped off the structure. The cranes were a 450 t capacity Liebherr LTM 1450-8.1 and a 250 t capacity Liebherr LTM 1250-6.1. Often, the units worked independently of each other in setting 38 m spans that weighed 38,5t. But, for one critical window, they came together to help set the two halves of the arch and hold them in position so Youngstown Bridge’s ironworkers could execute a mid-air splice.. Narrow timeframePlans for the lift were submitted months in advance to Norfolk Southern Railway, owner of the tracks and ALL specified the cranes. Once the plan was submitted, no changes could be made to the lift. And, when the approved work time finally came, the team on the ground would likely have just an hour to complete the placement of the arch. That is usually the maximum amount of time a railway operator can halt train traffic for lifting work to be performed.In the days leading up to lift day, Dan Lewis, project supervisor for Youngstown Bridge, had his team perform several pre-lift tests to make sure they would be ready to make the most of their time. “This gave our ironworkers the opportunity to fine-tune the rigging of each arch section, incorporating the actual crane configurations that would be used on lift day,” said Lewis. “This was important, given the time constraints. The team could know, well before the lift, that the two arches would be within a degree or two of each other at the splice point.” For these practice runs, Lewis also assigned zones on the arch to each of his ironworkers so they would know exactly where to focus their efforts and what tasks to perform during the actual splicing.The railway window was scheduled for mid-April then was suddenly moved up by three days. Lewis praised the flexibility of ALL Crane, noting how quickly they were able, on short notice, to mobilize the 250 t capacity LTM 1250-6.1 to have it assembled and ready for the lift. When the predetermined hour finally arrived to set the two arch sections, nearly eight months of planning came down to 60 minutes. The LTM 1450-8.1 was configured with 48 m main boom at a 15 m radius and the maximum of 134 t of counterweight. The LTM 1250-6.1 had 40 m of main boom at a 10 m radius.. Successful teamworkIn the days preceding, both cranes had already been quite busy. The two 38 m bridge spans were set on their respective abutments and temporary structures toward the middle, as well as a 75 m center span resting on the temporary structures. By installing the arch, which would assume the bulk of structural support duties for the entire bridge, the temporary structures below could be removed, and the bridge would be essentially complete. With the clock running, crane operators held each arch piece in position as a dozen ironworkers, six in man lifts and six on the ground, swarmed the area to install scores of bolts at critical splice points. There was a minimum number of bolts that had to be installed for the structure to support its own weight, and this became a crucial milestone. It meant that, should the work window start to close, the bridge would be stable enough to stand on its own. Otherwise, if the milestone wasn’t met, ironworkers would have to reverse course and disassemble the arch so they could try again another day. Given the difficulty in scheduling work windows, no one wanted this.At the 35-minute mark, when the threshold was reached, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Just 23 minutes later, at minute 58, the work was completed. There would be no need to schedule a second work window. The new hiking and biking bridge was now a reality..

Liebherr mobile crane helps place explosives at a height of 140 metres,Press releases |06/25/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-mobile-crane-helps-place-explosives-at-a-height-of-140-metres.html?page=63,"Two sites from a single location – whilst preparing explosives to demolish a coal-fired power station in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, the Liebherr mobile crane was working on another site at the same time due to high time pressure. Fitted with a luffing lattice jib with a maximum length of 91 metres, the new LTM 1650-8.1 from Bergheim-based crane contractor Wasel GmbH had to hoist explosives experts up to a platform on the chimney of the decommissioned power plant at a height of 140 metres. Façade components on the boilerhouse also had to be removed at the same time using radii of up to 80 metres.Find out more",Press releases,06/25/2021,"For crane operator Michael Müllers, this job with his new Liebherr crane was not exactly a comfortable one. The experienced crane operator in the cab of the LTM 1650-8.1 had to work on two sites at the same time for this demolition project. At the foot of the 250 metre chimney at the former coal-fired power plant, the crane was responsible for hoisting the explosives crew together with their drilling gear and explosives up to a work platform on the flue at a height of around 140 metres. Once there, they placed around 30 kilograms of explosives in 140 boreholes. As a result of its enormous height, the giant chimney could not simply be demolished by placing explosives at its base, and instead it had to be demolished using a single-folding method.. Required flexibility delivered by VarioBallast® The Liebherr crane had a total of 145 tonnes of slewing platform ballast to enable it to support the demolition work on the façade of the neighbouring building from the same location. Using its 91 metre luffing lattice jib, it was able to reach even the furthest points to help dismantle the façade. A large platform which held a team of workers and the salvaged material was hoisted in full over the neighbouring 70 metre high building. The platform was then used on the other side of the building at radii of up to 80 metres. The safety cage, personnel and demolition material created a gross load case of around eight tonnes for the powerful mobile crane with its impressively long luffing jib. To manage this large radius, Michael Müllers set the radius of the slewing platform ballast to the maximum value of 8.4 metres. For working on the chimney with radii of around 45 metres, the ballast distance simply had to be reduced to 6.4 metres using the hydraulic slewing mechanism.. Mandatory equipment – hydraulic unit for emergency take downA hydraulic unit was also on the site in the immediate vicinity of the crane in case of emergency. When working with safety cages and work platforms on the crane hook, a unit of this type is mandatory so that if the crane engine suffers a failure, the safety cage can be lowered safely at any time. However, it was not needed on the former power plant site. The crane, which, in fact, also has an integral emergency take down system of its own, functioned perfectly throughout the job which lasted several weeks.. After around six months in the operator’s cab of the LTM 1650-8.1, crane operator Michael Müllers is extremely satisfied with his new machine. Wasel GmbH is based in Bergheim near the River Rhine and, in addition to crane work, also provides heavy logistics, tower cranes and industrial assembly services. To date, the company has mainly used its new crane in refineries, for handling heavy goods and for jobs in industry. “The crane’s handling is really good, particularly setting it up,” says a delighted Müllers about the ease of use of the modern mobile crane. “And as far as lifting capacities are concerned, it represents a real quantum leap forwards. It’s a fantastic machine.”. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download.. Presseinformation Deutsch PDF (1.7 MB)Press Information EnglishPDF (1.6 MB)ImagesZIP (7.0 MB). .

Only truck-mounted cranes in the fleet – Krösche takes delivery of Liebherr LTF-1045 4.1 crane,Press releases |06/22/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/only-truck-mounted-cranes-in-the-fleet-kroesche-takes-delivery-of-liebherr-ltf-1045-4-1-crane.html?page=63,"Krösche-Kran Service GmbH has established itself as a special contractor for assembling prefabricated houses. The company’s headquarters are in Holzminden, Lower Saxony and exclusively uses telescopic cranes mounted on a standard truck chassis for its work throughout Germany. Liebherr handed over the second LTF 1045-4.1 truck-mounted telescopic crane this year to Krösche-Kran in May. They will replace old cranes in the fleet.Find out more",Press releases,06/22/2021,"Managing Director Joachim Ruthe explains: “For around 30 years, the Krösche-Kran fleet has consisted entirely truck-mounted cranes. The main factor for us is the flexibility of the concept as the cranes have comprehensive road permits. The LTF 1045-4.1 is the perfect example of this, because with five tonnes of ballast, its gross weight is still just 33 tonnes.”. Economical taxi cranesThe main areas of use for the truck-mounted crane is prefabricated house and industrial building assembly work. “Around 80 to 90 percent of all industrially manufactured prefabricated houses in Germany are assembled by Krösche. The permanent road licences provide us with flexibility in our job planning. That enables us to run the cranes economically, which is extremely important for smaller cranes. The long-distance driver's cabin of the truck chassis gives the crane driver the possibility to spend the night there. That means that we save on the administrative work for booking hotels as they travel the length and breadth of Germany”, says Ruthe.Truck-mounted telescopic cranes are economical alternatives in the taxi crane class for crane contractors who often cover long distances as a standard truck consumes less fuel than a similar all-terrain crane due to its design. Using a standard truck as the crane chassis also means lower costs for tyres and other wearing parts as they are mass produced.The LTF 1045-4.1 crane attains hook heights of up to 44 metres and radii of up to 42 metres with its 35 metre telescopic boom and folding jib. With its maximum ballast of nine tonnes, the gross weight of the 45 tonne crane is just 38 tonnes. The axle loads on the front axles are less than nine tonnes and less than ten tonnes on the rear axles.. Long term partnershipKrösche-Kran Service GmbH has been a Liebherr customer for almost 40 years and has made a major contribution to the development current LTF series. The company is also the biggest customer for Liebherr LFT cranes – over the last 15 years, it has expanded its fleet to around 60 cranes with lifting capacities ranging between 35 and 60 tonnes.Krösche first opened for business in 1899 as a forge. Today, the company has a 55-strong workforce and is the leading crane specialist for prefabricated construction assembly work, completing around 15,000 houses per year throughout Germany. In addition to its headquarters in Holzminden, the company currently has 30 additional mobile crane sites all over Germany.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr and GM to develop HYDROTEC fuel cell-based electrical power generation system for aerospace application,Press releases |06/17/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-and-gm-to-develop-hydrotec-fuel-cell-based-electrical-power-generation-system-for-aerospace-application.html?page=63,"General Motors and Liebherr-Aerospace have agreed to collaborate on development of a HYDTROTEC hydrogen fuel cell technology-based electrical power generation system for aircraft applications. The two companies will explore possibilities to leverage Liebherr’s strong position as a leading on-board aircraft system supplier, together with GM’s leadership in hydrogen fuel cell technology, to develop an integrated system, customized to the performance and economic requirements of commercial aircraft.Find out more",Press releases,06/17/2021,"Liebherr-Aerospace and GM have recently signed a joint development agreement covering the development of an electrical power generation system to demonstrate how hydrogen fuel cell-based power systems could be used in aircraft application. This demonstrator will be based on GM’s HYDROTEC hydrogen fuel cell technology. The construction and testing of this demonstrator will take place in a specialized laboratory multi-system integration testing at Liebherr-Aerospace in Toulouse (France). The demonstrator will incorporate GM’s precisely crafted fuel cells, HYDROTEC power cube and fuel cell system, along with the GM’s controls and models.GM, a leader in fuel cell technology, and Liebherr, with extensive expertise in technology integration in aircraft, are pooling their skills for this project. Lower emissions and lower noise than conventional aircraft operation: with these fuel cell advantages, among other things, both companies see a great opportunity for use in aviation. GM, through its relationship with Honda, is one of the world’s most advanced fuel cell developers in many industrial fields, now entering into aeronautics.GM’s fuel cell business benefits from decades of investment in engineering and manufacturing expertise with high volume processes that can bring economies of scale to fuel cell production.“Aircraft are a great litmus test for the strength and versatility of our HYDROTEC fuel cells,” said GM Executive Director – Global HYDROTEC Charlie Freese. “Our technology can address customer needs in a wide range of uses - on land, sea, air or rail, and this collaboration with Liebherr could open up new possibilities for aircraft, transitioning to alternative energy power sources.”Liebherr is one of the world’s leading suppliers of integrated on-board aircraft systems. Liebherr’s integrated aircraft system concept benefits from decades of investment in on-board thermal management and on-board power management.“The change from the conventional to a hydrogen technology-based electrical power generation system means major systems modifications on board the aircraft that could result in better, more efficient performance of the plane. This we want to prove and test thoroughly. The advantage of GM’s HYDROTEC fuel cell technology is that it has shown promise in extensive automotive and military programs, where it has shown to be reliable from the engineering and manufacturing perspectives.

In the future, Coamtra-Symco plans to use the two Liebherr cranes frequently for quick, safe tandem hoists, loading and unloading items at wind power sites.. 4-axle crane for a paper factory in UruguayCoamtra-Symco also ordered a Liebherr LTM 1120-4.1 for Uruguay, which is due to be delivered in June. “We selected a compact, versatile machine in the form of the 120 tonne model. Initially we will be using the LTM 1120-4.1 at a paper factory,” says commercial director Xavier De Bonis and continues: “This all-terrain crane requires very little space for the set-up process. It also has a long boom and outstanding lifting capacity values.” The large paper factory owned by Finnish company UPM is being built at Paso de los Toros, 260 kilometres to the north of Montevideo. Coamtra-Symco attaches a great deal of value to development and growth and sees its role in helping to contribute to the region.German de Bonis goes on: “We are supporting our customers and their projects by improving our services with quality, safety and economy. Our aim is to provide them with the best possible equipment for moving their loads. We were part of other construction and lifting projects in Uruguay, such as in the port of Montevideo where we participated in the construction of the new viaduct of the port promenade to improve circulation in the area and we participated with our cranes in the construction of a 57,000 square meters cellulose warehouse of UPM, as well as maintenance work in wind farms.”. About Coamtra-SymcoCoamtra-Symco is a leading heavy haulage and heavy hoisting contractor in Argentina. The company’s main areas of work include the energy industry, oil and gas, mining and manufacturing industry. German De Bonis, the group’s CFO says: “Despite the difficult situation at the moment due to the global pandemic, we are continuing to develop our company and are looking for new business in Latin America.” Coamtra-Symco mainly uses Liebherr cranes, as German De Bonis confirms: “Liebherr always provides us with the support we need. The after-sale service in Argentina and Latin America is both fast and reliable. What is more, Liebherr cranes feature excellent quality, performance and technology.”.

The latest purchase by the Dubai-based crane contractor is an LR 1500. It follows LR 1400, LR 1600/2 and LR 1800-1.0 cranes. High lifting capacities with compact dimensions designed for economical transport were the main criteria behind the decision to buy the Liebherr 500 tonne crane.Find out more",Press releases,06/15/2021,"Al Faris is one of the largest Liebherr customers in the world and invests significant amounts of money every year in the modernisation and expansion of its crane fleet. The current expansion of its crawler crane portfolio forms part of this strategy. Hillary Pinto, the Managing Partner at the company, says: “The LR 1500 fits perfectly into our fleet of Liebherr crawler cranes, which currently comprises three LR 1280 models, two LR 1400 and two LR 1600/2 cranes, an LR 1800 1.0 and an LR 11000. We plan to purchase more crawler cranes in the future”.. LR 1500 – compact, powerful and simpleIn the development of the LR 1500, Liebherr pursued the concept of “powerful – compact – smart”. It delivers the lifting capacities of the 500 tonne crawler crane class throughout its operating range whilst having the dimensions and component weights, which have previously been standard in the 400 tonne class. It can be transported economically all over the world due to the low transport weights of its individual components. The overall concept of the LR 1500 is designed for simplicity in every respect.“The crane delivers very good lifting capacities whilst having compact, transport-friendly dimensions”, confirms Pinto. The latest crawler crane technology featured on the LR 1500 and the company’s high level of satisfaction with its other LR crawler cranes in the fleet were additional major criteria behind the decision.

Liebherr fast-erecting crane on the island of Mainau,Press releases |06/11/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-fast-erecting-crane-on-the-island-of-mainau.html?page=64,"A Liebherr L1-24 fast-erecting crane is being used to ensure the fastest possible rebuilding of a collapsed heritage wall on the island of Mainau. From the outset, special emphasis has been placed on ensuring that the island’s tourism trade won’t be affected.Find out more",Press releases,06/11/2021,"The island of Mainau in Southern Germany is known as Lake Constance’s “flowering isle” and shares its stunning vegetation with visitors from all around the world. Amongst its many attractions, the island is home to Germany’s second-largest butterfly house and its world-famous rose garden. It is here that a 20-metre-long section of a historic wall suffered damage through ill-fated building work.. In order for the restoration to begin, all damaged pieces of wall have to be lifted separately and removed. The stone masonry and sculpture company Eduard Schnell decided on a Liebherr L1-24 fast-erecting crane to carry out this work. It is being provided by the Liebherr rental fleet based in the Upper Swabia – Lake Constance area. Markus Zeiler, Head of Gardens at Mainau GmbH, emphasises, “It was important to us that everything related to this project runs smoothly. We ensure that everything we do here on Mainau is absolutely environmentally responsible and doesn’t interfere with the visitor experience.” So, in addition to its technical specifications and reliability, the crane’s multi-award-winning design was also one of the criteria for choosing the L1-24.. A different kind of building siteIn the run-up to the crane’s assembly, all those involved were made aware that conditions would be different from those on an average construction site. Before assembly began, the ground under where the crane was to be installed was assessed by the BfB-Büro für Baukonstruktionen in Karlsruhe, as the crane was to be positioned directly on top of the backfill of a historic rampart wall and useful information regarding the walls and their backfill wasn’t available.. Access arrangements were also clarified in detail. The site can only be reached via a bridge, the weight limit of which is insufficient for a tractor vehicle towing ballast and the crane. On the day of assembly, the fast-erecting crane was transported over the bridge using one of Mainau’s own tractors, towed past the castle and then assembled by service technicians at the Liebherr site in Stockach. As the condition of the substrate couldn’t be specified with absolute certainty, the best possible precautionary measures were taken. Large-format steel plates were placed under the supports to keep the corner pressure points as minimal as possible. The crane was also positioned as far as possible from the collapsed section of wall.. Safety firstAs the island of Mainau is now open to the public again, additional safety measures were put in place regarding visitors. Liebherr’s sales and rental partner had an ABB operating range limiting system installed in the crane specifically for this purpose. Thanks to the fast-erecting crane’s state-of-the-art control system, this was programmed on site in no time at all. The ABB system prevents the crane from overshooting defined areas with its load. This means that the stone masonry company’s employees can go about their work knowing the safety of the island’s visitors is ensured.It will be several months before the historic wall is restored to its former glory. Until then, the island of Mainau has an extra attraction – a L1-24 fast-erecting crane.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr-Aerospace: Eco-responsibility in MRO means performance ,Press releases |06/08/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-aerospace-eco-responsibility-in-mro-means-performance.html?page=64,Liebherr-Aerospace works on a performance plan which enables all customers of its products including its MRO services to benefit from an eco-responsible approach.Find out more,Press releases,06/08/2021,"The whole Customer Service network of Liebherr-Aerospace is working on a long-term sustainability approach all along its products lifecycle, and goes even beyond official regulations to meet the business and industrial performance, through new projects and innovative solutions.Repairable and recyclable productsAs an OEM highly involved in the maintenance of its products, Liebherr-Aerospace designs its products to be repairable and recyclable: these criteria are taken into account from the first phases of development. In order to minimize “scrap and replace”, all equipment are provided with associated documentation to perform OE approved maintenance and repairs. Moreover, the Liebherr teams are regularly developing salvage repairs solutions for piece parts through their Design Organization Approval (DOA) agreement. Solutions such as upgrades and modifications enable to extend on-wing life, to manage obsolescence, to optimize repairs and to reduce noise emissions and consumption while enhancing flight performances.The next major challenge for air transport will be to deal with intensive maintenance or high fuel consumption of aircraft coming to their end-of-life. To meet that challenge, the aircraft will be dismantled and still useable products will be induced into recycling: various Liebherr equipment will be extracted and repaired as needed to feed inventories and pools such as “USM by Liebherr” (Used Serviceable Materials).Green industrial processesAs its ISO 14001 certification attests, Liebherr-Aerospace is committed to reduce its environment impact, and to manage closely its environmental risks, may they be related to pollution, emissions or to dangerous products handling. The Customer Services teams are constantly working on optimizing the consumption of energy and raw materials, on improving industrial procedures, as well as on the reduction and treatment of wastes. An appropriate worldwide network of Liebherr’s own repair stations and MRO licensees offers local services and avoids unnecessary transits while shortening turnaround-times. All these actions and requirements are shared with Liebherr’s worldwide supply chain.In order to accelerate the process, a project team has been embedded in the Liebherr-Aerospace Customer Service network. Its objective is to develop a specific strategy in combination with implementing European REACh-compliant procedures in the network. That implies that Liebherr-Aerospace will go even further than the official regulation by deploying and implementing sustainable processes for the repair and the maintenance of its products in its network worldwide.Digital transformationIn parallel, the current digital transformation of the maintenance, repair and overhaul activity contributes also to changes in the environmental performance of Liebherr-Aerospace’s Customer Services. The traditional documentation for example is now paperless; a remarkable change, considering the volumes of manuals that are required to operate and repair aeronautical systems. Nowadays, in order to avoid printing and shipping, 450,000 pages of 3,000 documents are made available digitally for the customers within the Liebherr-Aerospace network.Furthermore, “Liebherr-Aerospace is deploying health management services that help our customers to optimize the localization and to adjust the dimensioning of the inventories. In parallel, our teams are working on state-of-the-art Digital Smart MRO solutions enabling to generate more value while consuming fewer resources due to leaner direct processes,” explains Sven Dicke, VP MRO Operation & Strategic Investment at Liebherr-Aerospace & Transportation SAS.All these initiatives of Liebherr-Aerospace combine performance with eco-responsibility, because they shorten turnaround time and lead to longer on-wing life, as well as reuse of existing equipment..

First Liebherr Mobile Harbour Crane with fossil-free diesel,Press releases |05/26/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/first-liebherr-mobile-harbour-crane-with-fossil-free-diesel.html?page=65,The Port of Södertälje underlines its efforts to become a Green Port with the acquisition of the first Liebherr mobile harbour crane running on fossil-free HVO100 diesel. The new LHM 420 mobile harbour crane was recently delivered to the port and will significantly improve handling capacity in the container and project cargo sector.Find out more,Press releases,05/26/2021,"Rostock (Germany), May 2021 – With its proximity to the good infrastructure of Stockholm and its metropolitan area, the Port of Södertälje has a unique location in one of the most expansive regions in Scandinavia.The Port of Södertälje purchased a new Liebherr mobile harbour crane, type LHM 420 in 2020. The new machine was delivered in March 2021 and is already in operation at the port. With its lifting capacity of up to 124 tonnes and its 360-degree mobility, the crane offers the port flexibility in handling a wide range of goods. In addition, the crane is fully loaded with various assistance systems that make container handling even more effective and safe. Liebherr assistance systems such as the Vertical Line Finder, the Teach-In system or the Advanced Container Control make the crane a partially automated and intelligent crane. In addition, due to the proximity of the port to the city, the LHM noise insulation is installed.“The timing for us to invest in a third mobile harbour crane is perfect. It means that we can offer our customers a more efficient handling and permits continuing growth within the container segment as well as project cargoes”, says Robert Tingvall, CEO at Port of Södertälje, “we have a very modern terminal, focusing on efficiency, automation, and digitisation. We are very pleased and happy about this new crane.”. Next to emission-free with HVO dieselBesides all the useful and efficiency-enhancing features, the real special characteristic of the new machine for Sweden is its type of fuel. The machine is the first Liebherr mobile harbour crane to run on HVO diesel, which is almost emission-free. HVO Renewable Diesel is a premium fossil free diesel product made of 100% renewable raw materials, which does not release any new carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It is produced by hydro-treatment of vegetable oils and/or organic fats. The result is a premium quality fuel with a chemical structure almost identical to regular diesel and can therefore fully replace fossil diesel. The Port of Södertälje was the first port in Sweden to convert to fossil-free fuels. Since 2016, the port uses the environmentally beneficial fuel HVO100 to run its vehicles, machinery, and cranes.However, the port will only use the diesel engine to move the crane at the terminal. Once the crane is at the desired location, the electric motor will be used for cargo handling. The port's electricity also comes from renewable sources, such as wind and solar power.“Up to 30% of the electricity we consume comes from our own photovoltaic system, which is on the roof of one of our warehouses. The rest is green electricity from sun, wind, and water,” says Robert Tingvall, CEO at Port of Södertälje.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Structural Unlimited‘s LR 1300.1 SX crawler crane provided high lifting capabilities for construction of the new CHKD Mental Healthcare facility parking garage,Press releases |05/20/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/structural-unlimited%E2%80%98s-lr-1300.1-sx-crawler-crane-provided-high-lifting-capabilities-for-construction-of-the-new-chkd-mental-healthcare-facility-parking-garage.html?page=65,"Structural Unlimited, LLC was subcontracted to install pre-cast double tee’s and wall panels to erect a parking garage for the new Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters (CHKD) mental healthcare facility located in Norfolk, Virginia.Find out more",Press releases,05/20/2021,"CHKD officials along with Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, state and local officials and W.M. Jordan Company broke ground on the brand new mental healthcare facility in Norfolk, Virginia in September 2019. The impressive new $224 million facility will be a 14-story, 60 bed facility that will offer the highest level of care, standing out among some of the nation’s top pediatric mental health hospitals, with innovative patient- and family-centered design, research-based treatments, academic training programs for the next generation of child psychiatrists, and unparalleled support and community involvement, according to a CHKD press release.The facility will provide in-patient and outpatient services and will feature an indoor and outdoor recreation area and expressive creativity center for individual and group therapy. The new hospital also includes a rooftop recreation center and healing garden, providing a safe and secure area for patients to connect with nature and enjoy fresh air. The new hospital will be an addition to the current CHKD and Sentara Norfolk General complex and is scheduled to open in 2022.Structural Unlimited LLC was tasked with constructing the parking garage structure for the new CHKD Mental Healthcare facility located on Gresham Drive. The first floor of the parking garage is 19 ft. 10.5 inches high to accommodate ambulance needs going to the facility.Structural Unlimited, LLC used one of their 330 ton Liebherr LR 1300.1 SX crawler cranes fitted with carbon fiber pendants to lift and set concrete wall panels in place for each level of the parking garage. The construction of the nine story parking garage began in January 2021 and was completed April 2021. The LR 1300 operated up to 12 hours a day handling the precast wall panels that weighed between 50,000 to 90,000 lbs. Each panel was lifted and placed side by side and then welded together.. The LR 1300.1 SX crawler crane has a lifting capacity of 330 ton with a possible hoist height of up to 664 ft. For special lifts, where a higher load chart is required, a super lift attachment can be attached. The crawler cranes high horsepower engine provides plenty power for simultaneous movements of swing, main boom and luffing jib without slowing down, which makes jobsite operations like steel hanging very fast. Furthermore the machine is designed to quickly assemble and disassemble. “We quite often disassemble, move and assemble a LR 1300.1 SX within the same day,” mentioned Andy Merrell, owner of Structural Unlimited LLC.The LR 1300.1 SX is used in various applications such as steel erection, pre-cast and infrastructure work. The LR 1300.1 SX was the best solution for the CHKD parking garage project because of the cranes ability to make a pick-up of 90,000 lbs. at 110 feet outreach. The LR 1300.1 SX’s outstanding load chart proved to be an advantage.Additionally, there are many innovative optional equipment features available for the LR 1300.1 SX. One of those features is the new Boom-up and down assistance system which increases operational safety during assembly and disassembly. This assistance system indicates the approach to the tipping point and automatically stops operation before the operator unintentionally enters an unsafe zone. It also takes the machine’s configuration as well as wind into consideration.At this specific job site, Structural Unlimited was faced with the challenge of making sure the luffing jib tip remained underneath the Liebherr tower crane working on the same jobsite. The LR 1300.1 SX was equipped with 95 ft. of main boom and 125ft of luffing jib. The LR 1300.1 SX luffing jib can also be outfitted with a 3-part/99,210 lbs. aux. jib/rooster which on this particular jobsite Structural Unlimited did not require.Andy Merrell, owner of Structural Unlimited LLC said, “Liebherr’s reputation for developing reliable, high performing products were part of my decision to purchase Liebherr LR 1300’s.” Structural Unlimited LLC currently owns four Liebherr LR 1300.1 SX, all equipped with carbon fiber pendants for increased capacity and operates them in the southeast United States.

Since half a century, the Liebherr Group is well known as a manufacturer of high-quality construction machinery and off-highway applications. However, did you know that Liebherr also develops and manufactures diesel fuel injection systems? In an interview, Paul Mercurio, Sales Manager for diesel fuel injection equipment at Liebherr USA, Co., speaks about Liebherr common rail systems and gives insights into the technology, his daily business in the US and the challenges he and the Components’ team are facing day by day. Q: Paul, you are the face of the Liebherr-Components Division in the US, representing the activities of the fuel injection business unit. Would you please introduce yourself and explain how you and your department support the fuel injection business in the North-American market?A: I am an engineer by trade and have over 30 years of experience in the automotive industry, with the last ten years spent in diesel systems. Over the years, I have acquired a thorough understanding about the scope and landscape of the diesel market in the US and have established many valuable contacts in the business. On the one hand, I therefore bring my commercial and technical expertise to my colleagues and help them determine, where our products fit. On the other hand, I also give insight into new product developments, expectations and requirements in the US market.Q: Paul, would you please tell us about the Liebherr-Components Division, and how one of its business units – fuel injection equipment – integrates into the Liebherr world?A: Liebherr is known in the USA as a construction machinery manufacturer. Less well known is that Liebherr also manufactures functionally relevant system components for its own engines and machines and offers them to the external market. The Liebherr-Components Division does not only develop and manufacture combustion engines, but also fuel injection systems as a core component. This is exactly what the business unit fuel injection equipment is bringing to the US market.Q: Would you please explain, why Liebherr-Components also decided for a local presence in the USA?A: We know that electric vehicles are coming to the US market. However, many studies show that due to power density, reliability and cost requirements, diesel will remain the prominent powertrain of heavy duty and off-highway vehicles for many years to come. As this trend continues, Liebherr has much expertise in the development and manufacturing of combustion engines, which helps to support the market. Therefore, it goes without saying that it was important to establish a sales office in the US. The Components Division has been present in the US for around ten years and now promotes the expertise in fuel injection among others.. Q: What common rail solutions bear, in your opinion, the largest potential for the US market? A: For the majority of heavy duty and off-highway diesel in the US market, we are well-positioned with pumps and injectors to support engines in the 500 to 1,000 hp range. Exactly here I see the biggest opportunity. In addition, we have products, already in series production, which cover the power range from 1,500 to 2,000 hp for large engines.Q: Knowing the customer's challenges and needs and offering suitable solutions is Liebherr's credo. What do you think are the pain points for engine manufacturers with regard to injection? How can engine manufacturers benefit from Liebherr solutions and services to master the challenges?A: Relying on decades of experience, we know exactly what it takes large machines to perform reliably. A major pain point in internal combustion technology is fuel economy and exhaust emission regulations. The key in managing this is high quality and precision injection nozzles. Did you know that nozzle spray holes are often thinner than a human hair? Still they must withstand pressures of 2,500 bar and even greater. Some of our experts on site deal with nothing other than the nozzles day by day. Our competence in micro-precision components proves a high level of expertise in manufacturing mass-produced components. They help to improve fuel control, as well as efficiency, and allow for considerable exhaust emission reduction.Q: In March 2020, Liebherr announced a strategic cooperation with Stanadyne for the global development and production of common rail systems for the on- and off-highway market. What has happened to this cooperation over the course of the last year?A: Despite the challenges we all have been facing since 2020, our cooperation has grown further, so that we have identified new strategic developments in the US market. This will enable us to expand our activities in the US, particularly in the view of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which came into effective in July 2020. The US manufacturers of heavy-duty engines and equipment will increasingly require local production, and we will be well-prepared to meet that.Q: Much of your work and that of your team was and is still affected by the pandemic. What were and probably still are your personal challenges in terms of collaboration with customers? A: Clearly, 2020 was challenging for everyone. However, I approached that not by dwelling on what we were not allowed to do, but rather on what we could do. During the first quarter of 2020, before the pandemic, we were able to meet with several customers and to establish new contacts and identify potential new projects. When the pandemic came, we switched over to virtual communication channels and managed to maintain regular communication with our customers. All of the time, the entire team did a great job, constantly supporting each other, and I would like to express my personal appreciation to my colleagues in Europe.Q: What were your personal challenges in terms of working with the team in Germany?A: Immediately after starting with Liebherr, I travelled to Deggendorf (Germany), where I met everyone I would be working with and even more. I toured the facilities and learned about the current and future planned products. Normally, such on-site visits would take place more frequently during the year, which is currently not possible because of the pandemic. However, this period showed us once again, how important clear and regular communication is. I have vast experience in working for German companies, so I understand the differences in our cultures and in the ways of doing business.Q: How do you see the future of (diesel) injection technology for North America? The world of fossil fuel combustion engines is undergoing a massive change worldwide. Does Liebherr already have plans for alternative fuels?A: As I mentioned previously, we know diesel will remain the prominent powertrain of heavy duty and off-highway vehicles for many years to come. And Liebherr has the right products to support that. Regarding alternative fuel and powertrains, Liebherr does offer injection systems for alternative fuel powered engines and is also working on injection systems for hydrogen powered engines. Regarding electrified mobility, Liebherr is also developing electrified powertrains for some specific off highway vehicle applications.Read more"

But despite all the challenges, the company believes that it was a wise decision to continue with its investment.Ever since it first opened for business, Grúas Ibarrondo has remained true to its policy of continuously updating its fleet so as to keep it up with the state of the art. This is the only way it can achieve its objective of offering its customers the best possible service at all times in the form of a modern fleet.This was also the main reason behind the investment in the Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 all-terrain crane. Managing Director Mikel Ibarrondo explains: “Purchasing this new Liebherr mobile crane is another step towards cementing our competitive position in our markets. The 8-axle crane will be profitable for us thanks to its high technical development. And then there is also the fact that the concept behind the LTM 1650-8.1 is designed for sustainability in the form of its ECOdrive.”With its wide range of equipment versions, the LTM 1650-8.1 is a flexible, versatile crane. “We can use the LTM 1650-8.1 for a wide range of jobs. This is essential for us as we operate in various, widely differing sectors, including public and private construction, industry, ports and wind farms”, Ibarrondo continues.The ultimate machine on 8 axlesIt is always a great challenge to be better than a predecessor, particularly as it had been such a massive success. The LTM 1650-8.1 is based on the same premises as its predecessor – high performance, but featuring the very latest crane technology. Depending on its equipment package, the new 8-axle crane is between 15 and 50 percent more powerful than the LTM 1500-8.1. That means it can also tackle challenging hosting work in the 700 tonne class. Technical developments have made this possible because the Liebherr plant in Ehingen has been working intensively on improvements and new developments in crane technology since the predecessor first went into production 20 years ago.The LTM 1650-8.1 has also inherited two important concepts from the LTM 1500-8.1 – firstly, it is available with two telescopic boom lengths, 54 metres and 80 metres, and secondly, it features Y-guying which has been specially developed for telescopic booms. This increases lifting capacity and improves lateral stability significantly. Furthermore, the crane has a 91 metre luffing jib and a 62 metre fixed jib.Grúas Ibarrondo has been placing its trust in Liebherr’s quality and service for many years. Mikel Ibarrondo comments: “Liebherr is a reliable, long term partner for us. That guarantees that we receive maximum quality and excellent after sales service, any time, any place. That is extremely valuable as our cranes sometimes have to operate in very demanding environments”.The LTM 1650-8.1 completes the Grúas Ibarrondo fleet, which comprises 66 cranes, 41 of which were supplied by Liebherr. They cover almost the entire range of the LTM portfolio, from the LTM 1030-2.1 to the LTM 1750-9.1. The fleet also includes the 750 tonne LG 1750 lattice boom crane..

The modern, coherent machine and design concept impressed the jury of international experts. Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH is proud to receive this prestigious award just a few months after the digital product presentation in which the articulated dump truck was unveiled to the public for the first time. The Red Dot Award is considered to be one of the most important international awards in the field of design.Find out more",Press releases,05/18/2021,"The Red Dot Award: Product Design is presented to the best products each year. ""In search of good design and innovation"" – around 50 competition jurors were looking for well designed and innovative products this year. This year, the jury of international experts considered more companies and design studios than ever before in the 60-year history of the design competition. Products from around 60 countries were scrutinised over the course of several days. The coveted quality seal is awarded exclusively to products with an outstanding design concept.. New machine concept combines functionality and design The new TA 230 articulated dump truck was developed primarily for transporting excavated materials in the mining industry and for use in major infrastructure projects. It is an extremely robust and powerful machine that is configured for maximum payload in continuous operation, including in difficult terrain. Besides this machine concept, which is conceived for maximum technical functionality, the TA 230 can also be found in the new, progressive design language of the Generation 8 machines of the Liebherr earthmoving program.The powerful, agile machine concept of the articulated dump truck continues consistently through all fields of design, characterising the new design with unique, edgy and yet dynamic lines. A thoroughly imposing machine silhouette that impressed the jury of international experts.Red Dot CEO and initiator Prof. Dr. Peter Zec congratulated on the success: ""The winners of the Red Dot Award: Product Design 2021 are especially impressive this year. The design of their products is outstanding – with respect to both aesthetics and functionality. It is not easy to succeed and impress our jury in such a strong field of participants."". Development with a focus on visibility, safety and comfortBesides maximum efficiency and productivity, development of the new articulated dump truck focussed in particular on optimizing the view from the driver's cab, on comfortable and thought-out machine operation and on optimum illumination of the driving and working areas.The newly developed driver's cab features excellent panoramic windows without any obstructing struts, and a short, inclined bonnet, giving the machine driver an optimal view of the driving, working and articulated joint area of the machine. At the same time, the spaciously designed cab impresses with its sophisticated interior equipment, including numerous stowage compartments, storage options, a mobile phone bracket, USB charging ports and an air-sprung driver's seat as standard for maximum comfort. The operating concept of the TA 230 is well thought-out and impresses with its automobile-like handling. The logically and neatly arranged control elements and the numerous assistance systems such as hill start assist, speed retention assist or automatic traction control support the driver in his everyday work. Additional driving comfort is provided by the speed-dependent steering, which allows light and precise manoeuvring at low speeds and sensitive steering a high speeds. At the same time, fewer steering corrections are needed when cornering.The new lighting concept features LED headlights, ensuring improved visibility and safety, both for the machine operator and for everyone around the machine. LED dipped-beam headlamps with integrated high beam illuminate the road and the extra powerful, optional LED headlights on the front of the cab illuminate the entire working area. The L-shaped multifunction light with animated light functions is a homage to the Liebherr brand name – a novelty in the construction machines sector..

The final crane entered service in April 2021 and brings the operational capacity of the new terminal to over 1.5 million TEU per annum. The cranes, which are the first Liebherr STS at Tanger Med, were erected at a remote site in Cadiz, Spain before being shipped two at a time to Morocco. The first cranes were commissioned in October 2020, with four more following in quick succession, allowing the terminal to open for business in January 2021 with six STS cranes.The cranes were designed and manufactured by Liebherr Container Cranes Ltd. in Ireland. They have an outreach of 72 m, a lift height over rail of 54 m, a span of 30.48 and a backreach of 22 m. Safe Working Load under twin-lift spreader is 65 t. The ultra large STS cranes are future-proofed as they can cater for vessels with up to 26 rows stowed across the deck and include Fibre optic cores in the cabling, fault monitoring and remote diagnostics. Safety features including laser and ultrasonic anti-collision systems as well as smart slowdowns are installed as standard.Liebherr Container Cranes contracted with ALE Heavylift Madrid (later Mammoet) to assist with the assembly and transportation of the cranes. The cranes were ordered between March and November 2019, with delivery scheduled to take place during 2020 and 2021. The Covid pandemic with its global lockdown and strict restrictions necessitated an agile approach to site assembly in Cadiz and commissioning in Tangier. Utilising local support, Mammoet’s personnel and experienced Liebherr engineers, the project was able to proceed with minimal interruption. The cranes bring to twelve, the number of Liebherr STS cranes in Morocco with four cranes already in operation in Casablanca.. Gerry Bunyan, Global Sales and Marketing Manager for Liebherr Container Cranes said “The handover of these cranes to Tanger Alliance, is a key moment for the port. Tanger Alliance’s investment in Liebherr STS cranes will be rewarded with industry-leading productivity, low operational costs and the knowledge that the cranes will be available as required, to work on the world’s largest vessels for many years to come. We look forward to seeing Tanger Alliance maximise the cranes potential.”Tanger Alliance container terminal is a global transhipment hub and gateway for direct import and export volumes.

“The future for the crane industry is emission free”,Press releases |05/12/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-future-for-the-crane-industry-is-emission-free.html?page=66,"With the unplugged series Liebherr recently launched the world’s first battery-powered crawler cranes. Only hours before the official unveiling in December 2020, the very first LR 1250.1 unplugged had its premiere at a jobsite in Oslo. Customer Kynningsrud Nordic Crane AS was using the crane for lifting operations to build a new sports centre. But the story with the first customer begins even before the crane was ever planned.Find out more",Press releases,05/12/2021,"Two years ago at a business lunch with Liebherr representatives, Eirik Kynningsrud asked the question that changed everything, “What’s new in Nenzing?”At this time it was still top secret. But a sneak preview for the long-time customer was okay. “We are working on a battery-powered crawler crane.” Eirik’s curiousity was aroused and he wondered. “Do you have a first customer?” “No, not yet.” “Well, now you have one.”At this time Eirik hadn’t seen any drawings or plans of the LR 1250.1 unplugged. Some weeks later at Bauma 2019 Liebherr could show him the LB 16 unplugged, the first battery-powered drilling rig in the world. The idea was to extend the alternative drive concept to the crane. Another six months later first customer Kynningsrud saw the initial drawings of his unplugged model for the very first time.. Liebherr: You ordered the LR 1250.1 unplugged before it was even designed. How crazy is that?Eirik Kynningsrud, General Manager Kynningsrud Nordic Crane AS: We don’t think it is crazy. In Norway, we have the challenge that our government want to have zero emission construction sites, and we want to be a leading company for these projects. We always try to be the green alternative.How did it come about? I have been interested in the crane since I heard about it during my visit to Austria. At Bauma we had a brief presentation of the concept. It was convincing, and we decided we wanted the first LR 1250.1 unplugged.How did your partners react to the idea of ordering a crane you’ve never seen before?The partners were very positive that we can work emission free, and of course it attracts quite some interest, giving us positive publicity.Why was it so important to you to be the first customer of the LR 1250.1 unplugged?We wanted to be the leading company that delivers emission-free cranes.Are you planning to extend your fleet with other unplugged cranes? Yes, the future for the crane industry in Norway is emission free.You probably know that we will launch the LR 1130 and LR 1160 in unplugged versions this year.This is very interesting because the LR 1250.1 unplugged with its 250 t load capacity is too big for many projects and is, therefore, also more costly for our customers.. The first jobsite of the LR 1250.1 unplugged was in Oslo. How was your first experience? Very good, and the crane is still on the project.What was particulary positive at the crane’s premiere? We had a good presentation in Norway. Even Ingjerd Schou, Vice-President of the Norwegian Parliament, was there and held a speech about the importance of construction sites with zero emission.How was the feedback from the operator?Very good. To begin with he missed the accelerator pedal on the floor to adjust the speed of movements, but now he is accustomed to using only the joysticks. By the way, the heating system is brilliant.Have you received any feedback from Norway’s/Oslo’s population?Not yet, but the contractors are very positive.How important is the reduced noise emission of the crane in such metropoles?It is also very positive together with zero emissions. It makes it easier to communicate and, in a way, safer on the construction site.How does the electrical supply for the crane work?It works very well. We had no problems getting the electrical supply on the construction site.Have you already planned the next projects for the LR 1250.1 unplugged? We are working on several projects, but have not yet decided which project we will attend.Kynningsrud supports a HSE strategy (Health, Safety and Environment). Can you explain this philosophy?Kynningsrud Nordic Crane shall contribute to an environmentally friendly and sustainable development. We shall achieve this by identifying our environmental aspects, implement preventive measures and ensure compliance and continuous improvement while simultaneously placing requirements on our selection of goods and suppliers of services.Our efforts to minimize our influence on the environment involves everyone in the company, and we shall follow all relevant laws, regulations and requirements. When we invest, we think green, and all new machines shall have the latest environmental classification. Our focus is on an environmentally friendly machinery park and reducing our carbon footprint. Our vision, “pleasure of being useful”, and our values “honest - loyal - enthusiastic” provide a guideline for our environmental efforts.What role does the unplugged crane play in this?That should be clear – we aim to minimize our influence on the environment, to reduce our carbon footprint, and as you see – we think green!Let’s talk about tenders for construction projects. Do you already see an increased demand for alternative drive systems for construction machinery? Yes, absolutely. Particularly in the Oslo region, there is a lot of focus on reducing emissions on construction sites.If so, you can expect more projects with unplugged cranes, right?Yes, definitely!How do you like the name “unplugged”? I like this name a lot!. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr adds LTR 1040 to its telescopic crawler crane series,Press releases |05/11/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-adds-ltr-1040-to-its-telescopic-crawler-crane-series.html?page=66,"Liebherr has followed the wishes of its customers and in future will be able to deliver a lightweight version of its 60 tonne LTR 1060 telescopic crawler crane in the form of the LTR 1040. As many projects and tenders call for telescopic crawler cranes in the 40 tonne class, Liebherr has extended its telescopic crawler crane portfolio downwards. Contractors can upgrade the LTR 1040 to make it into an LTR 1060 retrospectively if required.Find out more",Press releases,05/11/2021,"The main difference to the LTR 1060 is the significantly reduced ballast – the LTR 1040 weighs in at a total of 20 tonnes less. 10 tonnes of central ballast have been taken off the chassis whilst a further 10 tonnes of counterweights have been removed from the slewing platform. This new crane model therefore delivers outstanding value for money in the 40 tonne class – its lifting capacities up to a medium radius significantly surpass those of its competitors and its 40 metre telescopic boom is around 30 percent longer than the standard in the class. This means that most crane jobs can be carried out without a folding jib.. Long, powerful telescopic boomHigh lifting capacities are particularly important for assembling prefabricated components, one of the main areas of work for telescopic crawler cranes. For example, the LTR 1040 will hoist up to 8.6 tonnes with a radius of 10 metres throughout its entire 360° operating range. When it is fully raised, the lifting capacity of the 30.7 metre extended telescope is 18.8 tonnes and when fully extended, the 40 metre boom can hoist 10 tonnes. Using a 16 metre double folding jib, the LTR 1040 can achieve a maximum hoist height of 55 metres and can hoist a weight of 3.1 tonnes in this configuration. All of these are outstanding values, which are far above anything that has been achieved before in the 40 tonne class.Economical transport, fast set-up timesThe LTR 1040 can be transported particularly economically as it weighs just 43.5 tonnes, including its 5.6 tonnes of ballast. The axle loads for transport are less than 10 tonnes for a 3-axle tractor unit and a 4-axle semi low loader. By removing 5 tonnes of ballast, the LTR 1040’s weight can be reduced to 38.5 tonnes, which means it has a gross transport weight of less than 60 tonnes.The crawler travel gear is retracted to a width of 3.0 metres for transport. The low crane height of just 3.15 metres ensures that economical standard semi low loaders can be used.. Ideal for assembling prefabricated componentsIts construction and design make the LTR 1040 ideal for assembling prefabricated components. With a 2.5 metre erection jib and a second hoist unit, it can also carry out work in 2-hook mode. The load absorbed with the erection jib by the low loader is transferred to the second hook on the telescopic boom. This means that prefabricated components can be rotated into the correct position and moved to the installation site on the crawler travel gear.The LTR 1040 can hoist up to 17.7 tonnes with 4-line reeving of the hook block on the erection jib. The runner on the LTR 1040 can handle loads of up to 9 tonnes as it can also use a double reeving constellation.High safety standardsBeing able to travel with a full load on the hook is a major benefit of crawler cranes. To exploit this feature to the full, Liebherr provides lifting capacity tables for various ground inclines.The fine gradation of up to 0.3, 0.7, 1.5, 2.5 and 4 degrees ensures perfect lifting capacities even on uneven site terrain types. On constricted sites, the LTR 1040 can also operate with its crawler tracks retracted to a width of 3 metres. Special lifting capacity tables are provided for this type of operation.Liebherr has designed the access to the crane cab to be particularly safe and convenient. The crane operator can access his workplace in any slewing platform setting using folding ladders, a fixed platform on the crawler track and an extra-wide step on the cab. There is no need to climb over the crawler tracks and chains. This means that the LTR 1040 already meets the highest safety standards of the future which will come into force when the new EN13000 revision is enacted over the next few years..

Modernization: Crane Maier takes over Liebherr mobile crane LTM 1070-4.2,Press releases |05/04/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/modernization-crane-maier-takes-over-liebherr-mobile-crane-ltm-1070-4-2.html?page=66,Kran-Maier GmbH & Co. KG from Landshut has modernised its crane fleet with a Liebherr LTM 1070-4.2 mobile crane. The Bavarian crane rental company is replacing an older 60-tonne telescopic crane with the new 70-tonner. State-of-the-art technology was an important criterion in the decision.Find out more,Press releases,05/04/2021,"Managing Director Susanne Maier explains the decision in favour of the Liebherr LTM 1070-4.2 mobile crane: ""The LTM 1070-4.2 is not only a crane that has proven itself over many years, but is also at the cutting edge of crane technology. For example, it already complies with the new Stage V exhaust emissions directive and the currently attached counterweight is automatically detected. We also ordered the VarioBase® variable outrigger base and the radio remote control. It was also important for us that the delivery time of the crane was acceptable"".. State-of-the-art crane technologyLiebherr initially launched the 70-tonner with 50-metre telescopic boom on the market with the type designation LTM 1070-4.1. Technical innovations such as speed-dependent rear-axle steering, disc brakes and the new LICCON2 control system were integrated in 2008 and the type designation was changed to LTM 1070-4.2. Liebherr has continued to keep this model at the cutting edge of mobile crane technology ever since. Technical innovations such as VarioBase®, ECOmode, a new crane cab, new one-piece steel rims and the latest generation of disc brakes have always been incorporated. Liebherr has now delivered more than 2,000 cranes of this type worldwide.. First use: erecting high-voltage pylonsSince November last year, Deutsche Bahn has been having pylons on the high-voltage line between Buch and Eching replaced. The reason for this is the age of the pylons, which were built as early as 1926. This is a traction current line for supplying electrified railways. The new pylons will be placed on the existing foundation and brought up to the current state of the art.. Kran-Maier sent its new LTM 1070-4.2 to support this project immediately after delivery. It took over the erection of some masts between Eching and Viecht. Crane operator Bennet Kühl is full of praise for his new work equipment: ""The crane runs very smoothly and the control is precise. The remote control is great."" The assembly of precast concrete parts, lighter garages and steel construction are other fields of application that Kran-Maier is planning for the new 70-tonner.Susanne Maier, together with brother Florian and father Erich, is now the third generation to run the family business. The largest of the ten mobile cranes is a Liebherr LTM 1250-5.1. She says: ""We are attached to our cranes and keep the equipment a little longer. Customer service and the supply of spare parts are very important to us. Liebherr is exemplary here"".. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

As before, LIKUFIX is still available for the medium-sized Liebherr wheel loaders L 526, L 538 and L 546.. Thanks to LIKUFIX: Quick and safe equipment changes when operating a wheel loaderThe smaller Liebherr wheel loaders from the L 506 Compact to the L 509 Stereo are known as versatile all-rounders. With LIKUFIX the flexibility increases even further. The machine operator can switch, for example, between a hydraulic 4-in-1 folding shovel, a forklift or a sweeper within seconds at the push of a button. The hydraulic lines are connected automatically and reliably with LIKUFIX which means no valuable time is lost.. Working with hydraulic tools such as high dump buckets, buckets with hold-down devices, log grapplers or separator buckets is typical for larger Liebherr wheel loaders. This is why Liebherr also offers its fully automatic quick-change system for larger wheel loader models. LIKUFIX makes it possible for the machine operator to easily change these and other tools at the push of a button from the cab. This increases safety, because when changing equipment, there is no need to leave the cab and therefore no risk, for example, of going out into the site traffic at a recycling yard.. The LIKUFIX quick change system is prepared for tough requirements. The hydraulic coupling is supported by springs. The forces that act on the quick coupler are therefore not transferred to the coupling system. Even with long periods of use, the connections between the hydraulic circuits remain absolutely tight. To make maintenance easier, all moving parts are easily accessible. If necessary, customers can easily carry out cleaning and simple maintenance activities such as changing a seal themselves..

Fully operational for Swiss natural product: Liebherr LH 60 M Port Litronic material handler,Press releases |04/29/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/fully-operational-for-swiss-natural-product-liebherr-lh-60-m-port-litronic-material-handler.html?page=66,"An LH 60 M Port Litronic was recently handed over to Aarekies Brienz AG in Brienz, Switzerland. The Liebherr material handler is specially designed for the economical handling of bulk goods and general cargo. The machine will be in operation extracting and quarrying natural sand and gravel in the harbour of the gravel and concrete plant at Lake Brienz. A special Liebherr clamshell with water slots will be used to extract the harbour’s naturally occuring sand and gravel and feed it into the plant.Find out more",Press releases,04/29/2021,"The Liebherr LH 60 M Port material handling machine will have a very special assignment. It will be assuming a key role in the quarrying and production of the unique Brienzer Sand®, a Swiss natural product. The powerful machine will be handling natural sand and gravel directly at the harbour basin at Lake Brienz, and will also be responsible for the subsequent feeding of the gravel plant.The machine has just been handed over at the harbour of the gravel and concrete plant. Hans Ulrich Kern and Reto Studer of Liebherr-Baumaschinen AG in Reiden presented a symbolic key for the new Liebherr material handling machine to managing director Dominik Ghelma and the general manager of the gravel plant, Kaspar Thöni.. Coherent overall package Dominik Ghelma is enthusiastic about the new Liebherr material handling machine: ""We used to operate a rail-mounted 1970s-vintage cable excavator in the harbour. When we were looking for a replacement, we decided to purchase a Liebherr material handling machine. Quite simply, the overall package is optimally configured for us. We have found an extremely versatile machine with the right attachments for everyday operations in our harbour.""This overall package is rounded off by a Liebherr service agreement. ""Regular maintenance will ensure a long service life and high level of availability of the machine,"" stresses Reto Studer. ""The service agreement means that Liebherr will perform the maintenance work on the LH 60 M Port, allowing the customer to focus all his energy on his core operations,"" he adds.. Focus on handling performance For Kaspar Thöni, handling performance was especially important in the choice of machine which is expected to remove up to 80,000 tonnes of natural sand and gravel from the harbour basin on an annual basis. The harbour has a depth of up to 9 meters therefore it was a requirement that the operator be guaranteed a perfect view of his work area at each of the many different stages of the handling process. The Liebherr LH 60 M in the customer's configuration meets this essential criteria without problems.The material handler is powered by a 4-cylinder Liebherr diesel engine with Stage V emissions compliance which, in combination with the standard Liebherr ERC system, delivers an overall system output of up to 322 kW to guarantee maximum handling performance. Moreover, the LH 60 M features specially designed port equipment. The weight-optimised construction ensures that the machine can boast maximum lift capacities. The specially designed port equipment includes a 12.5 m cranked boom and a 10.8 m long stick which easily achieve the required grab depth and reach of up to 21 m. The hydraulic cab elevation can be variably adjusted to the corresponding work situation in the harbour to guarantee that the machine operator always has an optimum view of his working area.. Liebherr GMZ 80 clamshell The LH 60 M Port is equipped with a GMZ 80 clamshell specially configured to meet customer requirements. The GMZ 80 impresses with its optimum design and good penetration, guaranteeing excellent handling performance. The 1650 mm wide, 2.00 m³ clamshell buckets are equipped with teeth on the cutting edge, allowing natural sand and gravel on the bed of the lake to be easily detached and loosened. The water slots on the clamshell buckets allow the water to drain off efficiently during the extraction and handling process. A reinforcement set on the inside of the wear-resistant clamshell buckets enhances durability and at the same time extends the service life of the clamshell.This type of grab is primarily used with machines of the 60 to 80 tonne class. During the design phase, care was taken when calculating the forces acting on the components to ensure that the flow of forces was optimised and weight was minimised, enhancing the overall performance. This has a positive effect on the machine's fuel consumption. The 2-motor Liebherr slewing drive is equipped with a large-dimension anti-friction bearing and impresses with its high torque and lifting force of up to 50 t. This allows the grapple to work effortlessly, even under full load.. Aarekies Brienz AGAarekies Brienz AG is a Swiss company based in the town of Brienz. The gravel and concrete plant was founded in 1940 and has been part of the Ghelma Group since 2007. The company's speciality is the trademark product Brienzer Sand®, whose low calcium content and round grain shape resulting from geology make it unique in the whole of Switzerland. The crystalline stone comes from the Aarmassif and is carried a long distance by the River Aare into Lake Brienz. There, it is excavated by the Liebherr material handler and then processed in the gravel plant. Its special properties have caused Brienzer Sand® to be used for many years in the building sector as the optimum aggregate for floor beddings and mortar. In addition, it is also used for turf-bearing layers and top dressings and for maintaining sports fields, golf courses and riding grounds..

Greater lifting capacity with higher wind tolerance,Press releases |04/26/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/greater-lifting-capacity-with-higher-wind-tolerance.html?page=67,"More powerful and stable in the wind – that is a rough summary of the main benefits that Liebherr has delivered for its customers in the form of its innovative SX2 and SX3 boom systems for crawler and lattice boom cranes. The reinforced booms are particularly helpful for wind power crane operations. The SX3 version delivers a major increase in lifting capacity of 20 percent and significantly higher wind tolerance compared to the conventional SX version. A new Liebherr LG 1750 crane, which was fitted with the SX3 version, operating at a wind farm in February benefited from these features. The lattice boom mobile crane operated by Dutch crane contractor M. Verschoor B.V. erected two Vestas turbines in the north-east of Germany with hob heights of 170 metres.Find out more",Press releases,04/26/2021,"The Dutch crane contractor owned by Maarten Verschoor has significantly extended its crane fleet’s performance upwards by buying a Liebherr LG 1750. The mobile lattice boom crane was supplied with the SX3 boom system which was required for its first job at a wind farm to erect new wind turbine type with extremely heavy tower components. “The first four tower sections each weighed 120 tonnes, which, when combined with the hook block, meant a load case of around 123 tonnes. With a radius of 35 metres, that meant that we use the full lifting capacity of the crane for this job”, explains Johan Bezemer, crane operator and part of the four-strong Dutch team at the site close to the German-Polish border. “This crane with its SX3 boom enables us to increase our capacities, so that we can also erect these very large turbines”, says Bezemer proudly about the new addition to the fleet. “Its 165 metre main boom and 12 metre jib gives us a lifting capacity of 127 tonnes. That is really enormous.”. Boom reinforcement makes working in higher wind speeds possibleWith this boom system, on which the lower section of the lattice boom has been extended to a width of six metres, however, Liebherr is not just reacting to the ongoing increase in the weights of components and hoist heights for erecting wind turbines. The 28 or 42 metre boom reinforcement (which is also fully compatible with the Liebherr LR 1750/2 crawler crane) delivers significantly greater rigidity in the boom design and therefore results in less crane downtime due to wind. “The earlier systems used on the LG 1750 were calculated on the basis of a maximum wind speed of nine metres per second”, says Jens Könneker, Product Manager for Crawler Cranes at Liebherr in Ehingen. “The SX system now allows work to continue in wind speeds of up to ten, or in some cases even 11.2 metres per second.” This is not just a major benefit for cranes working in wind farms, but is certainly a big plus for them.. Higher wind tolerance saves three working daysOn the snowy site where the new Verschoor crane undertook its first job, around 100 kilometres north-east of Berlin, the wind gauge at the top of the boom often provided the answer to the question of whether work was possible on any given day. Bezemer counts up the number of times when the greater wind tolerance of the SX3 boom system meant that the Dutch team could continue to work with their crane: “I think we managed to save around three working days.”After all the tower segments had been assembled, the lattice jib had to be extended to 15 metres using an intermediate section so that the crane could provide the hoist height required for the other components, including the 100 tonne gondola. The team from Verschoor required just two hours to modify the jib. The time required to lower the massive lattice boom was definitely reduced to a minimum as the LG 1750 was also fitted with the “VarioTray” detachable ballast pallet. The 415 tonnes of suspended ballast were actually only required to raise or lower the gigantic boom. The centre section of the counterweight, which can be detached from the remainder using bolts and remains on the derrick boom, was all that was required for the actual hoisting work. “That saved us an enormous amount of time and effort”, says Bezemer. “We can get straight on with the job without having to first stack or remove all the ballast.”. Most powerful crane in the fleetAfter spending several weeks in Germany, the team from Verschoor returned to the Netherlands with their LG 1750. Since then, the crane has been working full-time on erecting wind turbines in the north of the kingdom using its SX2 boom.The new crane is now the most powerful machine in Verschoor’s fleet. “We will probably only use the LG 1750 for wind power jobs”, says Erik Hans van de Kop, the company’s Managing Director. The company has a total of 70 cranes and 115 employees divided between its headquarters in Sassenheim (between Amsterdam and Den Haag) and a branch office in Almere. In addition to crane work, Verschoor also provides heavy haulage services and is active in the used crane and crane component business..

Liebherr wins ESTA Award in the safety category ,Press releases |04/26/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-wins-esta-award-in-the-safety-category.html?page=67,"The winners of the ESTA Awards of Excellence 2021 were announced at an online ceremony on 22 April. Liebherr was awarded in the safety category for the development of special WindSpeed Load Charts. These offer increased safety and more operating time when operating the crane in windy conditions. The Liebherr engineers in Biberach, Ehingen and Nenzing have made a large number of new mobile and crawler cranes more stable for use in stormy weather.Find out more",Press releases,04/26/2021,"Christoph Kleiner, Sales Director of Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH, accepted the award virtually and says: "" It’s great to be awarded in the Safety category, as this is a win-win situation: Increasing safety while increasing uptime of the cranes. And a triple win as three Liebherr companies are involved in this”.. Advantages of using mobile, mobile construction and crawler cranesThe development started in the year 2000 for mobile construction cranes with the MK 80 and in 2008 for crawler cranes with the LR 1600/2. Since 2020, more recent All Terrain models such as the LTM 1650 8.1 and LTM 1120-4.1 as well as all MK models also feature these charts. The major benefits for customers include enhancing safety and planning reliability, reducing downtimes caused by wind and increasing profitability.The load charts for cranes generally apply to gust speeds of up to 9 m/s, or for a mobile construction crane of up to 14 m/s, measured at the top of the boom head with an area exposed to the wind (including cw value) on the load of 1.2 m² per tonne. This is the standard with which all our competitors also have to comply. The wind load calculated from this is 50 Newtons per square metre.. Load charts for additional maximum wind speedsTo ensure that work can continue safely in even higher wind speeds, Liebherr has calculated the load charts for additional maximum wind speeds and programmed them in the crane control system. For the LTM 1650-8.1, for example, it is 11.2 m/s and 13.4 m/s when using lattice equipment. In telescopic boom mode, the charts even allow for a wind speed of 15.6 m/s. For MK cranes, the values are 17 m/s with the boom raised and 20 m/s in a horizontal position. If the wind speed measured on the crane’s boom during a job exceeds the set chart wind speed, the crane operator can simply switch to a load chart with a higher maximum wind speed which will often allow the job to be continued.. The latest generation of LR crawler cranes are equipped with wind sensors on the main and luffing jib. Both the measured wind speed and the respective configuration of the crane (boom length, angle of the boom) are taken into account in order to calculate the current situation of the crane. If the wind conditions become too dangerous, the system issues a warning. The respective status is shown in the cabin at all times. At wind speeds of 10-16 m/s, the driver can automatically adjust the max. load capacity with a simple push on the control panel.And this enhanced safety and increased crane availability has been very well received. Customers say that the new WindSpeed load charts mean that the crane is no longer the limit for jobs like before. It enables the rental company to continue to work when normally a job would not be possible due to the wind.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

New Liebherr R 928 G8 crawler excavator: The new addition to the Generation 8 family,Press releases |04/22/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-liebherr-r-928-g8-crawler-excavator-the-new-addition-to-the-generation-8-family.html?page=67,"The R 928 G8 crawler excavator is a completely new model, developed and produced by Liebherr-France SAS in Colmar. The new model positioned between the R 926 G8 and the R 930 G8 complements the current Generation 8 series, which already includes 7 models with a gross vehicle weight of 22 to 45 tonnes. The modularity of the new Generation 8 facilitated the launch of this new model as its design is based on existing, high-performance components. This new, weight-optimised combination should significantly reduce the transport problems of many customers.Find out more",Press releases,04/22/2021,"The R 928 G8 has several features in common with the R 926 G8 and R 930 G8: The same superstructure and equipment as the R 926 G8 and the same LC or NLC undercarriage as the R 930 G8. The performance of the R 928 G8 lies between the R 926 G8 and the R 930 G8.. The R 928 G8 crawler excavator rounds off the current range of Generation 8 crawler excavators. It is characterised by high drawbar pull, excellent load-bearing capacity and a large bucket. Its optimised weight also makes it easier to solve earlier transport problems. The R 928 G8 can hold its own with machines that are heavier than the R 926 G8 and lighter than the R 930 G8.. Generation 8: Product of continuous improvementLiebherr Generation 8 crawler excavators are the result of constant research and improvement work. This new generation is set apart by a new design and architecture. It has been reworked with the aim of creating optimal ergonomics and performance as well as increased comfort and safety.. Generation 8 develops higher tear and breakout forces compared to the previous generation. The torque of the superstructure has also been increased. This means that the new crawler excavators achieve higher levels of performance under site conditions. In addition, a new equipment concept enables the load curve to be optimised and the inertia in the rotary drive to be improved, reducing fuel consumption. The new, robust X-form undercarriages ensure greater stability. The automatic central lubrication ensures a longer service life of the parts and improves the productivity of the machines.The spacious, air-conditioned work cab is another feature of Generation 8. The operator enjoys a fully retractable front window, a pneumatic seat with vertical and longitudinal damping and an easy-to-use, high-resolution touchscreen. The use of LED technology reduces power consumption and improves lighting quality. The excellent all-round vision as well as the rear and side surveillance cameras maximise safety in the working environment.The cab is easily accessible thanks to the raisable control unit, the rear window also serves as an emergency exit. In order to improve safety during maintenance work, access to the superstructure and the maintenance platform has been widened and is now located at the side.Comfort and safety are thus guaranteed over the entire operation cycle of the Generation 8 machines..

Sycratronic as trailblazer for the wind industry,Press releases |04/21/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/sycratronic-as-trailblazer-for-the-wind-industry.html?page=67,The Liebherr Sycratronic tandem lifting system is used in the growing onshore and offshore wind industry. Liebherr mobile harbour cranes equipped with Sycratronic are increasingly being used for long and heavy components such as rotor blades or turbines. Nantes Saint-Nazaire Port has also recently started using two new LHM 550 and LHM 600 mobile harbour cranes. Both machines are equipped with Sycratronic and will handle parts for an offshore wind farm under construction off the French coast.Find out more,Press releases,04/21/2021,"The Sycratronic system improves the safety of tandem operation and makes it easier for terminal operators to increase their lifting capacities when combining two Liebherr mobile harbour cranes. While the system is developed to improve crane operations in all heavy-lift sectors, it is particularly useful in the on- and offshore wind industry where long components like rotor blades and heavy parts like wind turbines have become the norm. Tandem lifts are ideal for such applications and this is where Sycratronic comes in.Nantes Saint-Nazaire Port relies on Liebherr technologyNantes-Saint Nazaire Port is a new Liebherr customer. The terminal is modernising its old equipment with Liebherr mobile harbour crane technology. One of the most important criteria is the mobility of the machines and the ability to do tandem lifts. The terminal opted for an LHM 550 with up to 154 tonnes capacity and an LHM 600 with up to 208 tonnes maximum lifting capacity.The two new cranes will handle offshore wind turbines parts and assemble them for the offshore wind farm “Parc du Banc de Guérande”. The new windfarm from General Electrics is located twelve kilometres off the Loire-Atlantique coast and is scheduled to become operational in 2022. The windfarm consists of 80 offshore wind turbines with six mega watts per unit and total of 480 mega volts. Wind turbine parts, rotor blades with a length of 75 metres, generators, and monopiles will be assembled and stored in Saint-Nazaire before shipment to Parc du Banc de Guérande in 2022.""These new cranes meet our new needs related to the development of the marine renewable energy sector. The combination of the LHM 600 and LHM 550 cranes provides reliability and safety in the handling of XXL components such as masts or blades of offshore wind turbines,"" explains Ludovic Bocquier, in charge of Energy Sector Business Unit at Nantes Saint-Nazaire Port.Increased safety with full utilisation of the cranesThe biggest benefits of Sycratronic are improved efficiency and increased safety. Due to its advanced algorithms and built-in safety systems, Sycratronic allows the crane driver to fully utilise the load curve of the cranes. Often, during tandem lifts, lifting capacity can be restricted by regulations to 75%. Sycratronic overcomes this, allowing the two cranes to be treated as one, and so the usable lift capacity of each crane can increase by 25%, a huge advantage. The system also improves safety. The Sycratronic system monitors possible shifts of the center of gravity of the load and automatically corrects to ensure the best stability. The biggest advantage however, is the elimination of human communication errors between two crane operators, which can result in accidents, especially during tandem lift operations.How it worksUsing a Controller Area Network (CAN bus), the Sycratronic system connects two cranes and enables their central processing units (CPU) to communicate with each other. This allows the leading machine to provide input like the slewing angle, hoisting height and the weight on the hook to the following machine. This means that the following crane does not just simply follow its leader. Movements are automatically calculated and implemented.This makes it possible for one crane driver to operate both cranes simultaneously. In some circumstances, this may not be allowed for insurance reasons or national requirements. However companies can man the following machine with less experienced crane drivers, allowing them to use their experienced operators more efficiently.Synchronised lifting with Sycratronic.

New maximum: Flossdorf adds Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 mobile crane ,Press releases |04/21/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-maximum-flossdorf-adds-liebherr-ltm-1650-8-1-mobile-crane.html?page=68,"Dietmar Flossdorf GmbH ventured into the large crane class in 2017 with the LTM 1500-8.1. Now, four years later, the next step is being taken with the LTM 1650 8.1: the crane and heavy transport specialist from Bad Neuenahr in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate is increasingly receiving inquiries for situations where the performance of the 500-tonner no longer suffices.Find out more",Press releases,04/21/2021,"Company owner Dietmar Flossdorf visited the Liebherr plant in Ehingen with his authorised signatories Marco Flossdorf and Stephan Wassmuth to add the new, biggest crane to his fleet. Flossdorf had already ordered the LTM 1650-8.1 at Bauma 2019, having been instantly convinced by the concept of the new 8-axle Liebherr crane.. Marco Flossdorf even talks of a quantum leap. And the predecessor LTM 1500-8.1 is the most successful large crane of all time, with over 600 units sold. “Not only the much higher load capacity of our new crane, but also the new technology, such as the VarioBase® and VarioBallast®, are impressive.”Stephan Wassmuth agrees, saying: “The LTM 1500-8.1 was our most successful venture into the world of large cranes, but is no longer sufficient for many projects. We are therefore replacing it with the LTM 1650-8.1. It offers us a wide range of applications for hoisting heavy loads, transferring goods to barges, assembling concrete components, carrying out service activities on wind turbines, and in industrial activities such as lifting components into plants using a long luffing jib.”. Flossdorf purchased the LTM 1650-8.1 with the complete range of equipment and even opted for both telescopic booms – 54 and 80 metres in length respectively. “That offers us maximum flexibility and a particularly wide range of applications. The long mast, for example, is ideal for assembling construction cranes,” says Dietmar Flossdorf.Flossdorf was founded in 1953 and now has a 50-strong workforce. Flossdorf already has more than 50 years of experience with cranes, as it bought its first mobile crane in 1967. In addition to mobile crane rental, Dietmar Flossdorf GmbH also provides heavy transport, work platforms as well as rescue, breakdown and towing services. The company has a fleet comprising around 20 cranes and ten heavy-duty tractor units to cover all these different types of work..

Signed and sealed – Liebherr to kick off assembly of hydraulic cylinders in China,Press releases |04/20/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/signed-and-sealed-%E2%80%93-liebherr-to-kick-off-assembly-of-hydraulic-cylinders-in-china.html?page=68,"With an assembly line in China, Liebherr is expanding its capacity for the production of hydraulic cylinders in the Components Division. These are destined for the Chinese market and can from now on be manufactured directly in Asia.Find out more",Press releases,04/20/2021,"Liebherr currently manufactures earthmoving machinery and drive components at its Dalian site. With the TÜV certification of the Chinese production site, the Components Division is further expanding its global presence: In the future, hydraulic cylinders for the Chinese market will leave the Dalian plant in addition to drive components. Adding to an automatic washing system, part of this assembly line is also a painting system. Here the hydraulic cylinders can be painted in a suspended state on a conveyor. Another highlight is the assembly stand, which directly integrates final inspection for hydraulic cylinders.The hydraulic cylinder portfolio for the Chinese market consists of products for a wide variety of stationary and mobile applications, such as plant engineering or construction machinery. Liebherr will also produce cylinders for the rotor blade adjustment of wind turbines on site. The earthmoving product segment is currently producing a well-graded range of crawler excavators and wheel loaders for China and other export markets at the same plant. Assembly will start with hydraulic cylinders of the ""standard 380 bar series-production range"" for Liebherr crawler excavators from Dalian. In addition, the locally manufactured components will also be used in the wheel loaders produced on site in the future.. Liebherr promotes local value creationBoth European and Chinese customers are increasingly valuing the importance of local supply for their production companies. The company is therefore pursuing a ""local for local"" approach in two respects. On the one hand, the hydraulic cylinders assembled in Dalian are destined for the Chinese market. On the other, selected, proven local partners supply the mechanically machined individual components for the cylinders. This means that short delivery times can be assured. Those responsible for assembly in Dalian work closely with their colleagues at Liebherr-Components Kirchdorf GmbH. For example, all hydraulic cylinders produced in Dalian are developed in the Iller valley. There, initial sample testing of individual parts also takes place during the production startup.Part of an internationalisation strategyBeing close to the customer while tapping the full potential are the goals Liebherr is pursuing with the assembly of hydraulic cylinders in China. By producing cylinders in Dalian that were previously exported from the main plant to China, the Components Division will be able to optimally supply other Liebherr companies locally with hydraulic cylinders and grow in the external Chinese market. While doing so, jobs at the Kirchdorf site will be retained. At the same time, additional capacity is being created at the German plant in order to implement current portfolio expansion projects. These include new developments for industrial applications or additional hydraulic components, such as hydraulic power units and piston accumulators..

Replacement after 23 years: RMT rounds off all-terrain crane fleet with Liebherr LTM 1130 5.1,Press releases |04/20/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/replacement-after-23-years-rmt-rounds-off-all-terrain-crane-fleet-with-liebherr-ltm-1130-5-1.html?page=68,"RMT Albert Regel Logistik GmbH has taken delivery of a new LTM 1130-5.1 at the Liebherr plant in Ehingen. The specialist for heavy transport, crane and assembly logistics from Baunatal in the German state of Hessen is replacing a 23-year-old LTM 1120, previously the smallest mobile crane in the fleet, with the Liebherr 130-tonner. The new crane has a 15 metre-longer telescopic boom for a total length of 60 metres.Find out more",Press releases,04/20/2021,"Frank George, managing partner of RMT, came with his wife Marite, who is responsible for crane scheduling, and responsible crane drivers and truck drivers to the Liebherr manufacturing plant in Ehingen for the collection and instruction of the new 130-tonne crane. He commented: “The LTM 1120 was a powerful and reliable crane that experienced very few problems throughout its 23 years of service. However, its 45-metre telescopic boom was limited in terms of lifting height. So we’re looking forward to the 60-metre boom of the LTM 1130-5.1, which is also an awesome crane in its class.”The new LTM 1130-5.1 will have to prove its strengths on one of its first deployments: it will be used to erect a multi-storey office building in Stuttgart over a period of 16 weeks. “The boom length is obviously really important here. Given the large numbers of orders we have involving the assembly of prefabricated concrete elements, we also ordered a second winch and a heavy-duty jib. So we can turn parts in the air without any problem. We are able to cover a very wide range of applications with the LTM 1130-5.1,” said George.. Diversified crane fleet: four crane types with seven crane modelsThe diversification of the RMT crane fleet is impressive. Apart from the two universal all-terrain cranes LTM 1130-5.1 and LTM 1300-6.1, RMT also works with the off-road telescopic crawler cranes LTR 1100 and LTR 1220, as well as the compact lattice boom crawler crane LR 1200 from the Liebherr plant in Nenzing. Special find in the fleet: two 43-year-old lattice boom mobile cranes – a 6-axle Liebherr LG 1130 and a 7-axle AK 210 from Gottwald, a legendary crane manufacturer that long since stopped building mobile cranes. Frank George and his team know the benefits of each type of crane and deploy their seven machines to suit the task at hand.George explains the decision to keep on buying Liebherr cranes: “Liebherr offers us not only high-quality products, but also the best service. We always have a single contact person who can quickly come to our aid. Even for our vintage cranes, we still get replacement parts and support.”.

Liebherr: The Liebherr Group achieves over ten billion euros in annual turnover,Press releases |04/19/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-the-liebherr-group-achieves-over-ten-billion-euros-in-annual-turnover.html?page=68,"In 2020, the Liebherr Group achieved a turnover of € 10,341 million.Find out more",Press releases,04/19/2021,"Despite the modest slowdown of the global economy, Liebherr registered a strong volume of orders in the first quarter of 2020. Starting at the end of the first quarter, the coronavirus pandemic began to affect business activities in many markets. This also had an impact on the Group's sales revenues. With the exception of Refrigeration and Freezing, every product segment experienced a decline in turnover.. Revenues in the Earthmoving, Material Handling Technology, Deep Foundation Machines, Mobile and Crawler Cranes, Tower Cranes, Concrete Technology and Mining product segments were 10.4 % lower than in the previous year at € 6,848 million. Revenues outside construction and mining machines also fell. With the other product segments, including Maritime Cranes, Aerospace and Transportation Systems, Gear Technology and Automation Systems, Refrigeration and Freezing, as well as Components and Hotels, Liebherr achieved a turnover of € 3,493 million, a 15 % decrease compared to the previous year.. There was a downturn in sales in the European Union, which has traditionally been the Group's strongest sales region. This was primarily due to declining sales in Germany and France; by contrast, business grew in Austria and Poland. Sales in non-EU countries as well as in North America also declined. Central and South America, Africa, and the Near and Middle East reported significantly lower turnover than the year before. Meanwhile, business was stable throughout the year in Asia and Oceania. This was thanks largely to strong demand from China and Australia.. In 2020, the Liebherr Group achieved a net profit for the year of € 7 million. Operating results and the financial result also fell compared to 2019. In view of the year’s special challenges and extraordinary conditions, this can nevertheless be considered a success. Despite the significant decrease in turnover, the number of employees remained stable: At the end of 2020, Liebherr employed 47,925 people worldwide, that is just 124 employees fewer compared to the previous year.. Traditionally high investments in research and developmentAs a high-tech company, the Liebherr Group pursues the goal of making a decisive contribution to shaping the technological progress in sectors relevant to the Group. Liebherr invested € 512 million in research and development last year. The bulk of this was used in the development of new products. A large number of joint research projects with universities, other higher education institutions and research institutes were initiated and continued. These research projects focused heavily on the topic of alternative drivetrain technologies. In 2020 Liebherr expanded its product portfolio with several fully and partially electric machines and components in product segments such as Mobile and Crawler Cranes, Concrete Technology, Mining and Aerospace and Transportation Systems.. Digitalisation was another focal point of R&D activities. With the help of the Liebherr Remote Service App, a LHM 420 mobile harbour crane was put to work in Argentina – remotely from Germany for the first time ever. In the Refrigeration and Freezing product segment, it is worth noting that smart monitoring allows for the monitoring of appliances with a web-based dashboard in research and laboratories.. Liebherr is a founding member of the “Center Construction Robotics” project, which was granted a 10,000 m² plot by RWTH Aachen University in 2020 for a model construction site. Here, an interdisciplinary team of scientists from RWTH Aachen will work with a consortium of European industry leaders to study new construction processes, products, connected machines, robotics and software solutions as well as new training, working and communications concepts.. Investments in production, sales and serviceThe Group invested € 605 million in its production sites and its global distribution and service networks. The level of investment decreased by € 151 million compared to last year. Offset against this was depreciation of € 543 million. In Kempten (Germany) Liebherr-Verzahntechnik GmbH opened the “Liebherr Tech-Center”, where high-quality automation systems are tested and demonstrated in a 700 m² test hall. In the Refrigeration and Freezing product segment, Liebherr also opened a new site in Ulm (Germany), from where sales and service for Germany and digitalisation departments operate.. Outside Europe Liebherr invested in the construction of the new headquarters of Liebherr Panama S.A. in Panama City. In the Aerospace and Transportation Systems product segment, Liebherr-Transportation Systems (China) Co., Ltd. started operations at its new production site in Pinghu (Zhejiang Province). To meet demand in the Components product segment in the Asian market, a new factory for components is to be built in China. In addition, preparations are under way to begin the assembly of gears in India.. Outlook for 2021In the first quarter of 2021, order intake has already developed favourably across various product segments of the Liebherr Group, indicating a significant increase in sales in 2021. Overall economic opportunities arise from the global recovery of various industrial sectors in which the Liebherr Group is active in. At the same time, there is still uncertainty about the speed of macroeconomic recovery. For instance, it is unclear whether international trade will pick up or continue to decline, or whether the economic policies implemented by many governments can prevent debt from spiralling.. On Monday, 19 April 2021, the Liebherr Group publishes its current annual report. In addition to detailed figures, it contains a magazine section reviewing the past financial year.

More with the same – I.V. Guindastes upgrades LR 1600/2-W,Press releases |04/13/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/more-with-the-same-i-v-guindastes-upgrades-lr-1600-2-w.html?page=69,"To do more with less or with the same is what everyone is looking for in terms of operational efficiency. With the option to upgrade LR 1600/2-W narrow track crawler cranes, Brazilian crane contractor I.V. Guindastes started operating in even higher and larger wind power towers using the equipment they already had in their fleet.Find out more",Press releases,04/13/2021,"I.V. Guindastes has a wide fleet of Liebherr mobile and crawler cranes. Two LR 1600/2-W narrow track crawler cranes, which have completed eight years at the company, are dedicated to operation in large wind farms. For Ivo Boff Junior, Supply Director at I.V. Guindastes, the possibility of increasing the load capacity of the equipment, as well as the long-term partnership with Liebherr, were decisive factors when opting for the upgrade.. The upgrade of the LR 1600/2-W consists of extra lattice sections, and a software update, which allows operating with maximum control and safety with the new boom configuration SL13. With the upgrade, the LR 1600/2-W can reach a hook height of 165 meters and a maximum capacity of 73 tonnes within a radius of 22 meters, which meets the current demand from wind farms.“The possibility of increasing the load tables of our equipment was what at first drew our attention to this solution,” informs Ivo Boff Junior. “In some situations, with the upgrade, we can have heights even greater than we have with an 800 tonne crane and maintain the ease of operation the LR 1600/2-W have in the wind farm, which normally has narrower accesses. In this sense, having a leaner crane, with wider capacities, helps a lot in the work.”The 600 tonne crawler crane LR 1600/2-W is developed especially to serve the wind power generation industry. It has a narrower chassis with in total 5.8 metres, improving accessibility to wind farms, and boom systems that allow semi-assembled translation, making them more agile for this operation.. I.V. Guindastes has already acquired the second upgrade to the LR 1600/2-W in a period of 12 months. “With this upgrade, in addition to being able to use the LR 1600/2-W in wind farms on the new generation of wind power towers, which have generation capacity from 4MW to 6MW, with heights that can vary from 100 meters to 130 meters, we can also use this equipment in other applications, such as in the pulp and paper industry and in the Oil & Gas market,” Ivo Boff Junior adds.Charles Boff, I.V. Guindastes Commercial Director highlights: “With the upgrade we were able to have a new range of contracts, due to the new capabilities of the equipment, which until then were limited to the use of mobile lattice boom cranes LG 1750. With the upgrade, we reached capacities very close to that, expanding our application possibilities and, consequently, improving our offer to our customers.”The upgrade of the LR 1600/2-W also brought an improvement in the process of I.V. Guindastes: the possibility to lift the complete nacelle up to the top of the tower, which was already showing a trend in good practices in the assembly of wind towers. Igor Boff, I.V. Guindastes Technical Director explains: “Without the upgrade, we would lift each part of the nacelle individually and finish its assembly there, at the top of the tower. The great advantage of hoisting the fully assembled nacelle to the top is the saving of time. In a wind farm, the wind windows that enable the execution of the assembly and maintenance projects are short, so, lifting it completely, saves us time and improves operational efficiency.”. I.V. Guindastes and Liebherr have been in a partnership since 1993. “We have Liebherr as our main equipment supplier, since we started working with cranes. We opted for the brand and today we see that it is the company that has the best products for wind projects works,” explains Ivo Boff Junior. “Among the biggest benefits we highlight the customer service area, service engineering – which provides technical backup for complex applications from the factory engineering, and fast parts logistics”.I.V. Guindastes was founded in 1986, by Mr. Ivo Boff (i.m.) and today is managed by his sons, Charles, Igor and Ivo. The rental company has a fleet of 30 cranes, which feature two LR 1600/2-W and four all-terrain mobile cranes, LTM 1500-8.1. With about 200 employees, I.V. Guindastes today focuses its activities in the area of Lifting, Assemblies, Commissioning and Maintenance of wind towers.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Yet, there are still similarities. The Liebherr LPI gearbox series make a clear contribution to it.One of the most important key figures in motorsports is power density. The ratio between weight and torque is decisive for the development of power and speed. It is for good reason that in motorsports, the aim is to save every single kilogramme, ultimately resulting in a lightweight construction. In tracked vehicles, this might look a bit strange at first glance. Here, too, the saving of kilos plays a crucial role in certain applications.The Liebherr gearboxes from the new LPI series make a clear contribution to weight saving. Completely redesigned, they feature new materials, a significantly more compact design and a significantly lighter final weight. The result is a considerably increased torque density.For design engineers, this means that they can often install an entire gearbox size smaller than the conventional travel drives in their crawler undercarriages. This is possible thanks to this increase in the required output torque of the new gearboxes. A drive pair - two gearboxes in only one size smaller - helps to save up to 500 kg in weight even on a medium-sized crawler. This already amounts to a weight saving of half a ton. This creates new, interesting aspects, especially when it comes to developing tracked all-terrain vehicles or snow groomers. These machines should have relatively agile driving characteristics with the lowest possible fuel consumption, which is made possible by saving weight and installation space. Such a reduction also helps, if the payload is to be increased and the permissible total weight must not be exceeded.Seven basic gearboxes with a transmission range between 15 and 750 cover a torque array from 20,000 NM to 380,000 NM. They are available with two, three or four planetary stages. Robustly designed, they incorporate decades of experience from the heavy-duty travel drives of Liebherr's own mining machines.A powertrain consisting of electric or hydraulic motors with the lightweight LPI travel drives thus opens up completely new possibilities. Therefore, even heavy machines for mobile applications with a payload of several hundred tons can reach their top speeds even more easily. These may not be particularly high, but in terms of payload at maximum load, they are a remarkable result. ""In principle, it is similar to motorsports. Like in a racing car, weight reduction plays a very important role in chain-driven applications, especially when mobility is one of the main requirements. It's just all a bit bigger,"" says Enrico Menozzi, Head of Sales Europe at Liebherr-Components AG, with a wink.Another special advantage of the LPI gearbox series is its great flexibility. In addition to electric drives, they can also be used as original equipment or as a retrofit for hydraulic motors. In combination with hydraulic motors, such weight saving leads to a significantly lower fuel consumption and less harmful emissions for the environment.Read more"
Beyond borders: services for the wind industry ,News |04/12/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/beyond-borders-services-for-the-wind-industry-news.html?page=69,"Russia has made significant progress in the generation of wind power in recent years, although largely unnoticed. When the Russian government decided to increasingly promote renewable energy in 2017, new opportunities opened up for wind turbine manufacturers. At that time, the share of wind energy in Russia made up 0.02 % of the overall energy consumption. By 2035, the Russian Ministry of Energy is aiming to further expand wind energy capacity to nine gigawatts - enough to supply around eight million households. In order to build wind turbines in Russia, manufacturers must meet the requirements for local production, which serve to strengthen the local labour market.Find out more",News,04/12/2021,"At that time, the share of wind energy in Russia made up 0.02 % of the overall energy consumption. By 2035, the Russian Ministry of Energy is aiming to further expand wind energy capacity to nine gigawatts - enough to supply around eight million households. In order to build wind turbines in Russia, manufacturers must meet the requirements for local production, which serve to strengthen the local labour market.In view of this fact, Vestas, one of the leading manufacturers of wind turbines, reached out to Liebherr-Components four years ago to discuss the possibility of a potential support in entering the Russian market. It was no coincidence that Vestas chose Liebherr. Its 120-hectare site in Dzerzhinsk near Nizhny Novgorod was founded in 2006. There, Liebherr has been manufacturing steel assemblies for earthmoving equipment and cranes, as well as key components for the aerospace industry to the highest quality standards and customer-specific requirements for the Russian market for over ten years. Due to the technological expertise, industry knowledge and an ideal infrastructure on site, Liebherr was able to offer the customer a fast and flexible solution. As it was unclear at the time how the Russian market for wind turbines would develop, Liebherr offered the customer a welcome alternative to setting up their own local production.. Vestas promptly trained Liebherr's highly qualified employees in the assembly process. As a result, the assembly of the first nacelles for the wind turbines could start in mid-2018. The favourable location of the Liebherr plant near the Volga River also offers the possibility of transporting the finished nacelles by ship to the south of Russia – which is where many Russian wind farms are being built. In the meantime, nacelles for more than 150 wind turbines have been assembled at the Liebherr plant in Russia.As wind energy expands, more and more countries are placing demands on local value creation. ""Even outside of Russia, we offer flexible solutions for local production at our locations worldwide. The individual requirements of our customers are always in the forefront and are implemented together,"" explains Stephan Lausmann, Sales Director Wind Energy at Liebherr-Components AG. Liebherr-Components AG's unique serviceportfolio for the wind power industry is proving to be a major advantage in this regard. In addition to an extensive component portfolio ranging from slewing bearings to drives and pitch cylinders, Liebherr also offers various services to support its customers' development."

This function is intended for loading work, where the lifting gear is to be repeatedly raised or lowered to a certain height. Once the set position is reached, the lifting or lowering stops automatically.Likewise, a position can also be stored for tipping of the loading bucket in and out, which can be automatically controlled via the hydraulic sensor.. Unique measuring principleThe position transducer consists of the processing electronics and two probes. LiView measures the cylinder’s scattering parameters using signals at different frequencies injected onto the cylinder itself. Piston position and speed are calculated in real-time by the processing electronics. That allows for dynamic automation of machines.The LR 636 G8's areas of application include earthworks and landfill sites. It is suitable for applications that require extremely high breakout forces. LiView is the ideal partner here. The position transducer uses the cylinder itself as an extremely robust sensing element, making it ideally suited to the high demands of the LR 636 G8.Simple integrationLiView impresses with its quick and easy mechanical integration. The processing electronics can be installed either directly on the outside of the cylinder or at any location near the cylinder. In the LR 636 G8, the LiView electronics module is installed under the cab.Perfect interaction with Liebherr hydraulic cylindersIn the LR 636 G8 crawler, LiView measures the position of the Liebherr cylinders. As with the electronics, Liebherr also offers high quality and durability in the manufacture of its cylinders. The cylinder manufacturer installs the LiView probes and checks the cylinder with an integrated position transducer. The OEM receives a fully tested cylinder and can connect the electronics module directly. Thus, the fully equipped component can be put into operation easily and quickly.Liebherr hydraulic cylinders from the 380 bar series production range can be ordered with the position transducer already integrated. In addition to Liebherr's own cylinders, LiView is also suitable for numerous other cylinder types. Compatibility with new cylinders can be checked rapidly based on drawings and 3D models..

Bulet takes delivery of the first Liebherr LRT 1090-2.1 rough terrain crane in Nigeria,Press releases |04/06/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/bulet-takes-delivery-of-the-first-liebherr-lrt-1090-2-1-rough-terrain-crane-in-nigeria.html?page=69,Construction contractor Bulet International Nigeria Ltd has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LRT 1090-2.1. This is the first Liebherr LRT series rough terrain crane in Nigeria. The high safety standards and VarioBase® variable support base as well as Liebherr’s familiar good service were important criteria behind the decision to buy the rough terrain crane for the company based in the capital Abuja.Find out more,Press releases,04/06/2021,"Aliyu Isa, CEO at Bulet explains: “The new Liebherr crane will help us pursue our growth policy. At the same time, it will enhance safety on our sites”.""Safety first"" - safety equipment sets new standardsHigh safety levels in every respect are the main priority for the design of Liebherr’s new series of LRT cranes. They feature an outrigger monitoring system as standard. The outrigger status, on tyres or supports, is detected automatically and saved to the crane controller. The attachment of the ballast to the turntable and the installation of the optional double folding jib including its angle adjustment system are also recorded and monitored.The VarioBase® variable support base developed by Liebherr, which is standard on LRT cranes, makes a major contribution to enhancing safety. VarioBase® allows each individual crane outrigger to be extended to any length. The crane’s operations are protected by the LICCON controlled load moment limiter. This prevents accidents caused by human error during the assembly process and when hoisting loads. VarioBase® also delivers greater flexibility on site – as a result of the increased lifting capacities when hoisting over the outriggers, the crane can hoist loads normally reserved for the next higher crane class. Safety is also enhanced by providing greater comfort for the operating personnel. For example, the crane cabin on LRT cranes is 220 mm wider than other standard cabins on the market. It can be tilted backwards to provide greater comfort when hoisting loads to great heights. Clear, self-explanatory controls make the crane easy to handle.The whole concept also impressed Bulet. “We needed a crane for our workforce which is safe and easy to operate and provides very good visibility from the crane cabin. Furthermore, VarioBase® makes us more flexible on site, enabling us to complete hoists safely in constricted areas”, says Aliyu Isa.Among other things, Bulet plans to use the LRT 1090-2.1 on its sites to help with tower crane assembly and for hoisting work for which pick & carry operations are required. The LRT cranes are powered by a Cummins diesel engine which develops 194 kW (264 bhp) and delivers a maximum torque of 990 Nm. A 6-speed powershift transmission from Dana and large 29.5 R 25 tyres guarantee the required off-road capability.Familiar Liebherr quality and first class after-sales serviceBulet International Nigeria Ltd, with its workforce of around 1500, is one of the leading construction contractors in Nigeria. It has built the majority of the infrastructure and government buildings in the capital Abuja. Currently, Bulet has 15 mobile cranes. Aliyu Isa continues: “We hope that after the pandemic, we will be able to convert our fleet of mobile cranes to Liebherr rough terrain cranes. We also just started a new project involving two Liebherr NC-B 6-62 tower cranes and we also hope to add to their number. In addition, we have ten Liebherr concrete mixers and an outstanding purchase order for twelve additional mixers, ten Liebherr excavators and five Liebherr wheel loaders. Liebherr is known around the world as a manufacturer of world class products. We are familiar with the company’s quality and know how the machines operate in very harsh conditions. Another key factor is the first class after-sales service from Liebherr. That whole package made the decision to buy a new Liebherr rough terrain crane an easy one.”.

Urban development in Bremen – Sommer installs components for stairwell using LTM 1450-8.1,Press releases |04/01/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/urban-development-in-bremen-sommer-installs-components-for-stairwell-using-ltm-1450-8-1.html?page=69,"Covering an area of around 300 hectares, Überseestadt in Bremen is one of the largest urban development and port revitalisation projects in Europe. A Liebherr LTM 1450-8.1 mobile crane from Bremen crane specialist Sommer Kranverleih GmbH installed components weighing 20 tonnes for a connecting stairwell on one of the most striking building in the area, the 18-storey “Zech-Haus” at the head of Europahafen.Find out more",Press releases,04/01/2021,"Überseestadt in Bremen is developing into a widely diverse mixed use area. In addition to services, offices, trade, port economy and logistics, it includes leisure, culture and residential sites. A special project is giving the head of the Europahafen a whole new look – Bremen-based entrepreneur Kurt Zech is erecting four buildings with a total floor area of 100,000 square metres and a total investment volume of 300 million euros. When they have been completed, they will provide space for 340 rental apartments, 20 shops, a restaurant and an enormous market hall. It is scheduled to open at the start of 2022. The highest building in the complex dominates the skyline with its 18 storeys and has become known as the “Zech-Haus”.. “Without VarioBallast® we would have had no chance”For three days at the start of February, a 450 tonne mobile crane joined the giant tower cranes which have made the silhouette of Europahafen such a striking image since the construction project was started. Crane specialist Sommer erected the 8-axle Liebherr LTM 1450-8.1 mobile crane with 134 tonnes of ballast and a 52.5 metre luffing lattice jib. Crane operator David Hartung carefully threaded the prefabricated staircases and other components into the building and placed them gently in the positions that had been prepared for them. “A great team and a fantastic crane – everything went smoothly”, reports Hartung with satisfaction.. However, the constricted site posed a special challenge for using the crane. Andreas Meyer, Dispatcher at Sommer Kranverleih, explains: “The position for the large crane was extremely restricted with scaffolds being a particular obstruction. Fortunately, the ballast radius of the LTM 1450-8.1 can be reduced to handle these situations. Without VarioBallast® we would have had no chance”.The ballast radius on the Liebherr 450 tonne crane can be adjusted infinitely between five and seven metres using a simple hydraulic slewing mechanism. VarioBallast® is a massive benefit on constricted sites. For example, a radius of five metres is the sort of value you would expect from mobile cranes in the 200-tonne class.. Bremen project with Bremen companiesZech Group SE is a global medium-sized enterprise with family ownership. Gustav Zech founded a construction company in 1909 near Wrocław in what is now Poland, thus laying the foundation for the Zech Group. After the Second World War, the company restarted in 1945 in the form of a small craft company in Bremen. Today the group controls a number of branch offices and subsidiaries in several European countries from its Hanseatic headquarters.Sommer Kranverleih GmbH was awarded the order to install components weighing up to 20 tonnes for the “Atrium Bridge”, a connecting stairwell inside the building complex, using a radius of up to 48 metres. This family-run company was founded in Bremen in 1957 and the third generation of the family is now in control. Its portfolio includes mobile cranes with lifting capacities of up to 800 tonnes, heavy haulage and equipment relating to crane and transport services..

Liebherr R 9600 excavators perform in Australia,Press releases |04/01/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-r-9600-excavators-perform-in-australia.html?page=69,"Liebherr’s new 600-tonne mining excavator, the R 9600, enters the market backed by experience in the field at two Australian mines: BHP’s South Flank iron ore mine and Coronado’s Curragh North metallurgical coal mine operated by Thiess.Find out more",Press releases,04/01/2021,"Australia, 31 March 2021 – The R 9600, Liebherr’s successor to the popular R 996B 600-tonne excavator, was launched by Liebherr Mining Equipment Colmar SAS in March. Building on years of customer-centric research and development and, using the successful R 9800 800-tonne excavator as a solid foundation, the R 9600 enters the market with high expectations. The new R 9600 excavator is equipped with the most advanced Liebherr mining technologies to date, including Assistance Systems and the Hydraulic Excavator Automation Product “Bucket Filling Assistant”.. Australian marketAustralia is the largest market in the world for Liebherr’s 600-tonne class excavators, with over 70% of its machines operating predominantly in iron ore and coal. Since the serial release of the R 996 in the mid 1990s, over 115 of the machines have been sold in the country.As a result, Australia was identified as the ideal location for the trial and testing of pre-series R 9600 excavators. Two customers across two mines, have been operating pre-series machines in two different commodities since early 2020, to ensure the R 9600 can handle the harsh conditions and live up to the high expectations when it enters serial production later this year.. BHP, South Flank iron ore mineBHP has a strong history with Liebherr’s ultra-class excavators, particularly in iron ore mines in Western Australia. BHP commissioned their first R 9600 in March 2020 at South Flank iron ore mine and, by June this year, Liebherr will have six in operation at the site. South Flank, BHP’s flagship iron ore project, will be one of the world’s largest iron ore operations once in full production and aims to be one of the most revolutionary and innovatively operated mines.The R 9600s join the already extensive fleet of Liebherr excavators for BHP WAIO (Western Australia Iron Ore), predominantly the R 9400 400-tonne and R 996B 600-tonne class machines. The reputation of these excavators, along with the consistent support from Liebherr-Australia’s local branches in Perth and Newman, resulted in BHP opting for Liebherr as the preferred supplier of ultra-class excavators for the WAIO operations.Trent Wehr, Managing Director of Liebherr-Australia’s mining division stated, “Liebherr and BHP have strengthened our partnership over the past few years, and these six pre-series R 9600 units sold into South Flank represents the success of our collaborative efforts.”. Thiess, Curragh North coal mineThiess has been an equipment maintenance and operation contractor at Coronado Global Resources’ Curragh North metallurgical coal mine since 2004. Curragh North, located 30km north of Blackwater in central Queensland, has had a pre-series R 9600 in operation since May 2020.Thiess and Liebherr are not new to product development collaborations, with the mining services provider and OEM having partnered back in the 2000s to develop the 800-tonne R 9800 excavator. As one of the major customers of the R 996/B, it was fitting for Thiess to purchase one of the R 9600 pre-series units.Thiess’ Executive General Manager Assets Anthony De Domenico said, “partnerships like this benefit not only Thiess and Liebherr, but the broader mining industry through the trial of next generation fleet prior to its release in the market.”Thiess’ R 9600 will be utilised on a collaborative production study in April to validate the performance of the R 9600 excavator in the coal application. Additionally, a study intended to understand the performance gains from the new Bucket Filling Assistant, a combination of Anti-Stalling and Semi-Automatic Bucket Filling functions will be conducted conjointly.“The introduction of this new technology provides valuable maintenance data to increase machine performance and helps operators optimise payloads. It also ensures Thiess can reliably and efficiently meet production schedules and drive repeatable, high-quality outcomes for our clients,” concluded De Domenico.Wehr continued, “Thiess is an ideal partner for product development, having joined forces with Liebherr previously, and given our long, strategic, and successful relationship that has continued over many decades.“Liebherr-Australia looks forward to continued success of the R 9600 at Curragh North after promising results from initial productivity studies.”. Serial productionThe eighth R 9600 for Liebherr-Australia will be added to a coal operation in New South Wales in mid 2021. The R 9600 will enter serial production toward the end of this year.As with all Liebherr mining equipment, the predecessor models the R 996 and the R 996B will continue to be supported through parts and service for the duration of the machine’s lifetime.For more information on the new Liebherr R 9600 hydraulic excavator, visit the Liebherr website: www.liebherr.com/nextgeneration.

A second added to the fleet – Rothmund shows its support for the Liebherr LTM 1230 5.1 mobile crane,Press releases |03/31/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/a-second-added-to-the-fleet-rothmund-shows-its-support-for-the-liebherr-ltm-1230-5-1-mobile-crane.html?page=70,"Rothmund GmbH Kran und Montage has purchased another LTM 1230-5.1 from Liebherr. The reason behind the purchase decision was the good experience the Pforzheim-based company has had with the first machine of this type it purchased around six months ago. Managing Director Heiko Brückner is particularly impressed with the boom length, capacity and variability of the Liebherr 5-axle crane.Find out more",Press releases,03/31/2021,"""We decided to buy a second LTM 1230-5.1 because we think that this crane’s concept is just right. We can use it for a very wide range of jobs with its VarioBase® variable support base and the different ballast versions. Its high lifting capacities and very long 75 metre telescopic boom are ideal for assembling construction cranes”, says Brückner.. “The gold piece from Gold Town”The mobile cranes in the Rothmund fleet feature bright red lettering on a light background. One of the two LTM 1230-5.1 cranes, however, stands out with golden lettering on a black background. Heiko Brückner continues: “The first LTM 1230-5.1 was a special crane for us with its a unique, special paintwork – “40 years of Rothmund” in golden lettering on the black crane. Thanks must go to the signwriting team at Liebherr who gave us a great deal of their time. Actually, all our cranes have girls’ names. But the black LTM 1230-5.1 is an exception – it is our ‘Goldi’ – the gold piece from Gold Town – that’s what it says on it”.Pforzheim is world-famous for its jewellery and watch-making industry. That is what the nickname of Gold Town or Gold, Jewellery and Watch Town refers to. Around 75 percent of German jewellery is made in the town which has a population of over 120,000 and is located at the northern edge of the Black Forest.Rothmund has also decided to buy a second Liebherr LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane. “The elevating cab delivers a whole host of benefits and the crane is popular with our customers – it’s a great crane”, says Brückner.. Rothmund celebrates 40th anniversaryRothmund GmbH Kran und Montage is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. The company currently employs around 50 people and its fleet consists of more than 20 mobile cranes with lifting capacities of up to 350 tonnes, 10 forklift trucks with capacities between 2 and 18 tonnes, low loaders and box trailers as well as loading cranes. The company also carries out complete machine relocations throughout Europe. As Brückner explains: “If you want to be a success in this industry, everybody has to work as a team. That means teamwork and sticking together are our watchwords. Liebherr has been extremely successful using this same policy. There is also the fact that Liebherr cranes retain their value very well. That pays dividends when it comes to selling them.”. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The new MK 73-3.1 mobile construction crane from Liebherr: a compact taxi crane with optimal reach,Press releases |03/30/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-new-mk-73-3-1-mobile-construction-crane-from-liebherr-a-compact-taxi-crane-with-optimal-reach.html?page=70,"The new MK 73-3.1 mobile construction crane is the smallest in Liebherr’s mobile construction crane family and complements the crane series comprising the MK 88-4.1 and MK 140. The compact 3-axle crane is the answer to market demands for a small, compact and agile mobile construction crane that is fast and flexible in operation.Find out more",Press releases,03/30/2021,"Mobile construction cranes are predestined to be used as taxi cranes and, with this in mind, the MK 73 3.1 is also designed for one-man operation. This crane is ready for use in around 10 minutes. Additional transport vehicles are not required for the MK73 3.1. The electrically operated crane can be supplied with site power or powered by its integrated generator. The single-engine concept, familiar from Liebherr’s mobile cranes, and its ECOmode feature ensure reliable travel and economical operation on site.For the MK 73-3.1, Liebherr has chosen proven technology in an extremely compact form. The small mobile construction crane combines all the features of its big brother, the MK 88-4.1. With a total length of 13.80 m, a width of 2.75 m and a height of 4.0 m, it is impressively compact and, as a result, extremely easy to manoeuvre. It offers a 6-tonne maximum load capacity.Long reach optionsTo meet the typical demands of densely built-up inner city construction sites with projecting edges, this latest mobile construction crane has been designed with long reaches in mind. With a jib length of 38.5 m, it offers a jib head load capacity of 2,000 kg with corresponding additional ballast. In a 45-degree luffed jib position, the crane reaches a lifting height of 51 m and has a maximum lifting capacity of 2,800 kg; up to 1850 kg at the jib head. Engineers have placed strong emphasis on a design with a consistently high maximum load capacity in all luffed jib positions. Three possible luffed jib positions ensure flexible operation.Electric crane operationLike its big brothers, the MK 73-3.1 operates electrically on site, either via site power supply or its integrated electric generator. This ensures an extremely quiet and emission-free presence, which in turn is ideal for working at night and in noise-sensitive areas. The small mobile construction crane is also designed for operation with 63 or 32 amps. Working speed is in no way restricted when using the 32 amp option.Extensive featuresSimilar to the other mobile construction cranes in the series, the crane operator is supported by diverse assistance systems. Highlights include an infinitely adjustable lift cabin and modern camera systems – both load and undercarriage are always in view. Assistance systems such as the Micromove fine positioning mode ensure precise load handling. Five steering programmes with active rear axle steering and half-sided support enable the crane to be used on particularly tight construction sites.Additional options such as the Load Plus load curve and reinforced trolley travel gear further increase the crane’s performance. This enables up to 50% heavier loads to be lifted in a 45° luffed position.Single-engine conceptThe single-engine concept already used by the mobile cranes of sister company Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH, has been adopted for the MK 73-3.1. This concept makes operation even more economical: the electric generator on the MK 73-3.1 mobile construction crane is only operated by the travel motor in the undercarriage. The ECO mode also comes into play here.Liebherr has packed all the technology features of its big brothers into this small mobile construction crane; impressive manoeuvrability and flexibility combined with reliability ensure an efficient, modern addition to any crane fleet..

The SCR parts kit is fully equipped with the necessary parts, including step-by-step guide, to enable the immediate repair of SCR systems of Stage IV/Tier 4F and Stage V machines by site staff. The kit is available for all crawler cranes up to capacities of 300 t, duty cycle crawler cranes and deep foundation equipment, as well as mobile harbour cranes and reachstackers, which comply with these emission standards.Find out more",Press releases,03/26/2021,"Liebherr has compiled a new service kit for the repair of SCR systems of Stage IV/Tier 4F and Stage V machines. Especially these types of repairs require immediate attention in order to keep costs and standstill time to a minimum. Site personnel can carry out repairs immediately without the need to call in external services.The SCR parts kit contains original parts from Liebherr. These are subject to the same rigorous quality inspections as the machines themselves. They are perfectly tailored to Liebherr diesel engines and so provide the optimum compatibility required of individual parts. An accompanying manual clearly explains all components and tools and describes the corresponding working steps in detail. The sensitive SCR components are housed in a robust and specially adapted case in order to provide ideal storage, as well as high flexibility and mobility.When time is of the essenceShould an SCR issue arise on a machine the timeline for troubleshooting is dictated by international laws and regulations and is defined by four levels. The first three levels result in graduating power reductions. However, time is of the essence. Level 1 must be remedied within 60 minutes of the first warning, level 2 within 170 minutes and level 3 within 200 minutes. Level 4 troubleshooting and repair can be carried out only once. If this one attempt fails, a Liebherr service technician is required to repair and reset the SCR system.Using the SCR parts kit, the troubleshooting for all four levels can all be easily performed by site staff. This new support for customers provides a major benefit in maintaining the timeline and overcoming external factors.Customer satisfaction to the foreThe new SCR parts kit is paramount in the continued support for Liebherr customers during the present pandemic, which currently curtails the travel and attendance of Liebherr service personnel at customer sites.

New Liebherr LTM 1120-4.1 shows its capabilities on Swiss sites,Press releases |03/25/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-liebherr-ltm-1120-4-1-shows-its-capabilities-on-swiss-sites.html?page=70,"Family-run Christen + CIE AG based in Biel in the Canton of Berne (Switzerland) is the first Swiss crane contractor to take delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1120-4.1 mobile crane. This is the most powerful 4-axle crane on the market and is mainly used by the crane and transport logistics contractor for jobs in industry. As a result of its compact design, impressive lifting capacity values and its 66 metre telescopic boom, the company often uses it for erecting tower cranes.Find out more",Press releases,03/25/2021,"“My new, more powerful crane with VarioBase® needs less space on constricted sites than my previous 100 tonne crane, but that was not actually a Liebherr machine”, says Matthias Kofmel. The young Swiss, who has manned the cab of the LTM 1120-4.1 on building sites in the Canton of Berne and beyond for the last few months, is delighted with the handling of his new machine: “The crane enables me to move to a different site in a very short time and I can get it ready for use again quickly as a result of its very short set-up times.”. Ready to go 20 minutesThe new LTM 1120-4.1 has already demonstrated its short set-up times. After working on the steel erection for a building at the waste incineration plant in Biel, it had to move to a site around ten kilometres away as quickly as possible.After hoisting the last steel girder, Matthias Kofmel needed less than 20 minutes to get his mobile crane ready for the road. He then drove his new crane to its next site, where a Liebherr 85 EC-B construction crane was waiting to be dismantled. “When I erected this top-slewing crane with my old mobile crane, I needed more space than now”, said Kofmel as he telescoped the outriggers on the crane supports precisely using the VarioBase® system. This variable support feature had already been used at the waste incineration plant to give delivery vehicles more space on the side away from the load.. “The crane works at a very high speed”The LTM 1120-4.1 dismantled the construction crane in what could easily be a record time. Matthias Kofmel had set up his mobile crane with full ballasting of 31 tonnes in just one hour. The dismantling work on the 30 metre construction crane then took around five hours. When lowering the crane components, the LTM 1120-4.1’s boom, which had been telescoped to a length of 45.2 metres, had to work with radii of up to 26 metres. “The crane works at a very high speed,” says Kofmel. “Using the Liebherr mobile crane made me an hour or two faster than it took me to erect the 85 EC-B with my old crane. And the road handling of the new machine is absolutely fantastic. I managed to drive it up the very steep access road to this site in one go without any problems.”. Christen + CIE AG based in Biel was founded in 1882 as a horse and carriage company. Today, in addition to crane work, it also provides its customers with services for transport and heavy haulage logistics, company relocations and work platforms. The modern company currently has a 20-strong workforce and also has a mobile construction crane supplied by the Liebherr Plant in Biberach..

Liebherr invests in its Ehingen site,Press releases |03/25/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-invests-in-its-ehingen-site.html?page=70,"Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH is making itself fit for the future. The company is investing a sum in the high two-figure millions to make its internal processes future proof. The WeLog Project includes building work at the Ehingen site, the restructuring of the material flows, a new building for the Repair Centre South Germany in the Ehingen suburb of Berg and the introduction of a new ERP system. This major project is scheduled for conclusion in 2024.Find out more",Press releases,03/25/2021,"Ehingen / Donau (Germany), 25 March 2021 – There have been many changes since Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH was founded in 1969 by Hans Liebherr. The company at its Ehingen site has grown continuously and now has a workforce of over 3500 people and a factory area of around 900,000 square metres. But even after more than 50 years of successful history, a company cannot afford to rest on its laurels. Despite ongoing modernisation work, it has complex structures and a warehouse which is no longer state of the art and must be replaced as a matter of urgency.. The WeLog Project, short for “Plant development logistics” is the action Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH has taken to face up to this challenge. Its aim is to ensure that materials are stored and transported efficiently and smartly. Internal procedures will be simplified to ensure that production can continue without interruption in the future. This will also result in further improvements to the quality of mobile and crawler cranes. Production Director Ulrich Heusel underlines the necessity of the project as follows: “Currently around 2000 mobile and crawler cranes leave our plant in Ehingen every year. That is an extremely high number, and represents almost a two-fold increase over the last 20 years. Now there is an urgent necessity to adjust our structures and material flows at the plant accordingly. We produce at a high tempo, but we nonetheless have to remain flexible as some of our customers want short term modifications to their cranes – depending on the order content. And we can only guarantee this flexibility, whilst maintaining our high quality and assembly speed, by making these investments.”This mammoth project will mean changes for many of the personnel. For the management and project team it is therefore particularly important to include all the employees in the process, as well as keeping them informed and communicating transparently with them. “It is very important for us to emphasise that the ‘Plant development logistics’ project will not threaten any jobs, and in fact it is more likely to create additional jobs in the long term”, says CFO Daniel Pitzer. Liebherr uses three colours to ensure greater clarity within the WeLog Project. Red stands for standard production, blue stands for everything related to customer service and spare parts, whilst crane repairs at the new Repair Centre South Germany in Berg will be shown in green.. Construction projects at the plant are already underwayLiebherr has already taken the first steps for the project – building work is already underway at high speed on the factory site in Ehingen. The existing old main warehouse will be split into a warehouse for spare parts and a warehouse for standard production, involving the erection of several new buildings. This will enable procedures to be planned perfectly in the future and problems to be avoided as what has been a single warehouse in the past will be split into two sections, therefore guaranteeing greater availability of components.Work on building the new spare parts warehouse started in autumn 2020. Extensive work on the foundation is required to create the highly modern complex, consisting of a truck gate, two-storey hall area, high-bay shelving warehouse and small parts warehouse. Large drilling rigs from Liebherr’s sister plant in Nenzing (Austria) drilled exactly 465 holes for auger piles. These are anchored in the foundation soil at depths of between 18 and 33 metres. This will also make it possible to generate energy for the new building using geothermics. The new spare parts and shipment warehouse is due to be completed and fully functional by 2024.Liebherr is also building a separate warehouse for parts required for the standard production of mobile and crawler cranes. This warehouse will be divided between two buildings. One building will be used as a pallet warehouse, whilst a small parts warehouse and a so-called “goods supermarket” will be established in the second building. The first parts from the existing warehouse will be transferred to the new standard production warehouse before the end of 2021. In addition to erecting the new buildings, Liebherr has also had to make significant changes to the road system within the plant to access the construction sites whilst maintaining all the current procedures. “When you look at everything going on at the plant at the moment in terms of new buildings and processes, we can definitely say that we are making the Ehingen site fit for the future. And the Liebherr family is spending in the high two-figure millions for this purpose. This is a clear signal to the whole workforce and the Town of Ehingen”, explains Pitzer.. Construction of the new Repair Centre South GermanyEarthworks were also commenced in the Ehingen suburb of Berg at the start of 2021 – the location for the new Repair Centre South Germany. “By outsourcing the repair centre, we will be able to significantly improve the services we offer to our customers, particularly in southern Germany. We are also expecting to be able to take on service orders, which in the past we were unable to accept due to restricted capacities”, says Managing Director Sales, Christoph Kleiner. “Furthermore, this will create some of the space we urgently require for the new warehouse building at the main factory site.”The relocation and commissioning of the new repair and administration building in Berg is scheduled for mid-2022.Software migration with new ERP systemIn addition to all this building work, Liebherr is also working flat out on the introduction of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. An ERP system can be described as the heart of the company. It comprises a large number of inter-communicating IT systems or databases within a company. This highly complex production and planning system controls the whole business and also manages all the master data required for the task. The new system, InforLN, will initially be introduced in the Customer Service Section. This change is scheduled for mid-2022. The new Repair Centre South Germany will also use this new software package as soon as it starts operations. By mid-2024, all the divisions that make up Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH will have been migrated to the new InforLN software package. At the same time, InforLN will also be introduced at the Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH subsidiaries based in Germany, Oberhausen and Alt-Bork..

Addition to the fleet – Steil purchases Liebherr LTM 1120-4.1 mobile crane,Press releases |03/24/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/addition-to-the-fleet-steil-purchases-liebherr-ltm-1120-4-1-mobile-crane.html?page=70,Steil Kranarbeiten GmbH & Co. KG has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1120-4.1 mobile crane. The 120 tonne four-axle crane will be added to the fleet operated by the group based in Trier. Its long telescopic boom and high capacity combined with compact dimensions impressed the management.Find out more,Press releases,03/24/2021,"“The crane is a good addition to our very diversified fleet”, is how company owner Birgit Steil explains the decision to buy the new Liebherr LTM 1120-4.1 mobile crane with its 66 metre boom. It will replace an old 4-axle 100 tonne machine with a shorter boom.The most powerful all-terrain mobile crane on the marketExactly one year ago, Liebherr launched the new LTM 1120-4.1 with the slogan “There’s nothing more on 4!” at one of the last trade shows to be held before the coronavirus pandemic, the Conexpo in Las Vegas. It is the most powerful all-terrain mobile crane with the longest telescopic boom on four axles in the world.These performance data helped Steil reach its decision: “The compact dimensions of the crane relative to its high lifting capacity were impressive, then there is the boom length and the VarioBase® variable support base. The crane also benefits from being able to obtain permanent road permits because it travels at a gross weight of just 48 tonnes”.LTM 1120-4.1 suitable for new possible usesThe new powerful LTM 1120-4.1 can tackle jobs which normally would require a 5-axle crane, eliminating all the logistics work needed for larger models. Because a 4-axle crane delivers benefits in terms of licensing and route permits, it can tackle jobs faster and with greater flexibility. The design of a 4-axle crane also enables it to tackle jobs where there is insufficient space for larger cranes. On constricted sites, in particular, Liebherr’s VarioBallast® and VarioBase® innovations deliver enhanced performance, flexibility and safety for this new crane model.VarioBallast® on the LTM 1120-4.1 enables the crane to operate with a ballast radius of 3.83 or 4.77 metres. The ballast radius can be reduced by 940 mm quickly and easily using standard, mechanically adjustable ballasting cylinders when site conditions get tight. The large ballast radius delivers higher performance and often also cost benefits by reducing ballast transport, as many crane jobs can be completed with fewer counterweights.Company trusts in Liebherr’s range of modelsSteil will mainly use the LTM 1120-4.1 for jobs in industry where it can best demonstrate its strengths. The group now has a workforce of around 300 and runs 120 cranes, more than half of which bear the Liebherr logo. A second LTM 1110-5.1 was delivered to Steil in February and another LTM 1230-5.1 plus another LTM 1060-3.1 will follow over the next few weeks. “Service and the availability of spare parts are both reliable and good at Liebherr”, says Birgit Steil.The Steil Group provides crane services on a regional basis, but also provides services for wind power customers based throughout Europe. The company’s range of services also includes heavy haulage, rescue and towing services, machine relocations and oil slick removal work. Its subsidiary Onroad provides crane relocation services throughout Europe.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The foundations for Norway’s longest railway bridge ,Press releases |03/24/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-foundations-for-norways-longest-railway-bridge.html?page=71,An extreme inclination and execution from a barge: the foundation piles for the railway bridge in Minnevika are a challenge. The specialists from Aarsleff Ground Engineering found the right machine for the job in Liebherr’s LRH series. The whole project is writing a chapter in Norway’s Book of Superlatives.Find out more,Press releases,03/24/2021,"The bridge in Minnevika is part of Bane NOR´s large expansion of the railway system in Norway. The project will considerably shorten the travelling time between Oslo and Hamar. In two years, high-speed trains will travel on the stretch and sprint over this section. Although projects for the rail infrastructure are currently under way throughout the whole country, the bridge over the River Vorma is something very special.“Before rail traffic is permitted, the piles must rest for at least two years.” Dennis Jensen works as Senior Project Manager with Aarsleff Ground Engineering. PNC, which is a company owned by Porr, engaged the company to carry out the piling works for the foundations of the bridge. The construction consists of 20 pier shafts with 280 friction piles, which Aarsleff has to drive into the ground. “The design challenge lay in achieving the ground bearing capacity because the rock lies so deep, therefore inclined piles were required. The project is situated in a inland lake, which makes the transportation of large machines and large materials much more difficult.”. A question of inclinationAarsleff is deployed the Liebherr piling rig with fixed leader system, the LRH 600, in order to complete the demanding task. “We decided for this machine because of the possible hammer sizes for inclined piles. It is very strong and stable.” An important criterion emphasized by Dennis, “We have to drive in the piles with an inclination of up to 1:5 and the hammer size was an important requirement both for Aarsleff and also the capacity of the LRH 600. Liebherr was the only supplier that could fulfil our technical requirements with a short notice and deliver a carrier machine and leader as a complete package.”In this case the duty cycle crawler crane HS 895 HD is the carrier machine. Aarsleff positioned it on a barge and is driving half the total piles into the bed of the River Vorma. “The stability of the piling rig on the barge is surprising. Even with strong currents we can position the piles within the tolerances specified for the project in water 12-14 m deep.” The steel pipes have a foundation length of 58 m, a diameter of 1016 mm and a weigh of 29 t.. An important milestoneAn advantage of the LRH 600 is that the leader can simply be inclined forwards or backwards instead of having to reposition the barge for each individual pile. The leader and the spotter are connected to the boom head via supporting tubes. This means the operator can alter the leader height without influencing the leader inclination. Higher precision in driving is achieved through the additional leader lowering device.“The pile driving work was an important milestone for the project,” says Dennis. “We achieved it eight months earlier than the clients milestone for pile installation.” Even more spectacular considering the interruptions due to lockdown. The piles represent the foundations for the bridge across the River Vorma in Minnevika. It will be opened for rail traffic in autumn 2023 and, at 836 m, will be the longest railway bridge in Norway..

Liebherr launches R 9600: The next generation of hydraulic mining excavators,Press releases |03/24/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-launches-r-9600-the-next-generation-of-hydraulic-mining-excavators.html?page=71,"After years of development, the Mining Division of the Liebherr Group is proud to launch the new R 9600 hydraulic excavator. This 600t excavator sets new standards in the open pit mining market.Find out more",Press releases,03/24/2021,"Colmar (France), March 24, 2021 – The successor of the popular R 996B enters the market after gaining a year of field experience in Australia, the largest market for 600-tonne class excavators. This new development builds on years of customer-centric research and is based upon the successful R 9800 800-tonne excavator. A total of 8 units will be operating in Australia by end of 2021. The R 9600 will enter serial production at the end of this year.. A customer-centric approachCustomer input has played an important and pivotal role in the development of this new machine. Engineering, sales and marketing teams have collected feedback and insights from mine site equipment operators, maintenance personnel and procurement groups as well as executive management to have a clear understanding of the challenges they meet every day. The new R 9600 aims to reach the highest standard in terms of safety, sustainability, performance, lifetime, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), ease of maintenance and more.After testing the first prototypes at the factory proving grounds in Colmar, France, in early 2020 the first R 9600 pre-series excavators started operating in iron ore and coal applications in Australia. Liebherr, together with its two very important customers BHP and Thiess, started the partnered validation of the first two units in the field. Backed by this validation phase, the R 9600 is ready to enter the global market.. Diverse offering of powertrains including electric driveThe R 9600 is equipped with two QSK50 Cummins engines with advanced combustion technologies. Understanding that fuel costs form the major portion of the TCO for mining machines, Liebherr has developed and implemented LPE solutions (Liebherr Power Efficiency). These proprietary management systems for the engine and hydraulic system controls substancially reduce fuel consumption without compromising the overall productivity of the machine. These new features grant also an additional step toward the Liebherr emission reduction solutions.For emission regulated regions, a US EPA Tier 4f / EU Stage V compliant version is available with the latest SCR after-treatment technology. Complying with stringent emission regulations, the SCR system reduces nitrogen oxides by injecting a liquid reductant into the exhaust stream.An electric drive version will be available soon, a productive choice for mine sites having the required electrical infrastructure.. Weight-optimized attachmentThe R 9600 attachment makes use of smart component design such as the patented “EVO” backhoe bucket, hydraulic cylinders, shift levers, bucket links and attachment pins. The result is an increased overall production rate without compromising component lifetime.In standard backhoe configuration with a Heavy Duty wear package, the R 9600 comes with a 37.5 m3 / 49.1 yd3 bucket to deliver an ideal truck/shovel match with Liebherr mining trucks. It loads 190t trucks in 3 passes, T 264 240t trucks in 4 passes, T 274 300t trucks in 5 passes and T 284 375t trucks in 6 passes.The excavator is also available in face shovel configuration equipped with a 37.0 m3 / 48.4 yd3 shovel, as standard with a Heavy Duty wear package.. Long-lasting performanceDesigned to be used in all applications globally, the R 9600 is built to last over 80,000 machine operational hours. Further improving machine reliability, the uppercarriage structure is a completely new development. The robust undercarriage with a fatigue resistant steel structure, is enhanced with a new hydraulic track tensioning system. The standard sealed for life heavy-duty carrier and track rollers incorporate the patented roller path design and registered track pad design.As an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Liebherr has built a solid reputation in the development and production of high quality components for mining applications. The R 9600 benefits from this reputation through reliable components that are developed and manufactured by Liebherr. The R 9600 utilizes the latest quality control systems to ensure the best reliability and highest performance.. The latest cabin generationThe R 9600 has a brand-new cabin designed by operators for operators – it is a first-class, state of the art 14 m3 / 150 ft3 working space. The cab design reduces vibrations and limits noise to 69 dB, providing a comfortable working environment for the operator.To allow for the best possible working conditions, Liebherr engineers have placed the cab of the R 996 successor back on the left side, standardising with other excavators in the range. The operator’s seat has been positioned as far left as possible in order to provide the best operator visibility of the attachment and working area. Ambient and low-level LED-lights make working at night easier and safer. The operator station is user-friendly and equipped with modern touch screen displays.

Sönke Jordt expands fleet with a Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 mobile crane,Press releases |03/23/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/soenke-jordt-expands-fleet-with-a-liebherr-ltm-1110-5-1-mobile-crane.html?page=71,"North German crane and heavy haulage contractor Sönke Jordt GmbH & Co. KG has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 mobile crane. The new 5-axle model will expand the company’s crane fleet. Full order books and good experience with its predecessor the LTM 1100-5.2, were behind the decision to invest in a new Liebherr 110 tonne crane.Find out more",Press releases,03/23/2021,"Managing Director Tim Jordt travelled with crane operator Johannes Astecker and Johannes Böhme-Stromberg, the driver of the BF3 escort vehicle, to the Liebherr Plant in Ehingen to collect the new LTM 1110-5.1. Jordt explains: “The LTM 1110-5.1 will be added to our fleet as we have full order books and we have gathered some very good experience with its predecessor, the LTM 1100-5.2. The new 110 tonne crane’s telescopic boom is actually eight metres longer as it extends to 60 metres. The new crane’s performance is outstanding, particularly with the new trapezoidal support configuration.”. Greater performance and safety using variable support baseThe VarioBase® variable support base generates higher lifting capacities in the areas above the outriggers. The Liebherr engineers went a step further with the new 110-tonne crane – as the rear supports are double-stage. With a support width of 8.3 metres, they are 1.3 metres wider than at the front, which increases the capacity over the rear outriggers. Liebherr calls the combination of the trapezoidal and variable support base VarioBase®Plus.VarioBase® not only increases capacity, but also guarantees safe crane operations when it is not possible to fully extend all the outriggers on constricted sites. “Safety always comes first for us. I am therefore also delighted with the ballast monitoring system on new Liebherr cranes”, says Jordt.Among other things, the new LTM 1110-5.1 will be used by Sönke Jordt for erecting tower cranes, jobs in industry and handling heavy goods at the Port of Lübeck. It is not just crane operator Johannes Astecker who is delighted about his new workplace, his joy is shared by BF3 driver and Liebherr fan Johannes Böhme-Stromberg: “Liebherr is fantastic, always producing new innovations, simply the best!”Decision already made for another Liebherr mobile craneIn January 2021, Sönke Jordt took delivery of an LTC 1050-3.1 with RemoteDrive and the decision to buy an LTM 1230-5.1 had already been taken. The Ratekau-based company was founded in 1994 and in addition to mobile crane rental the company also provides heavy haulage and industrial assembly services. Its crane fleet now comprises 13 mobile cranes with lifting capacities between 30 and 300 tonnes as well as three loading cranes with hoisting moments between 53 and 163 metre tonnes..

Crane trio: 8-axle cranes from Eisele and Riga work for monument protection,Press releases |03/17/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/crane-trio-8-axle-cranes-from-eisele-and-riga-work-for-monument-protection.html?page=71,"Crane and heavy haulage specialists Eisele AG Crane & Engineering Group from Maintal near Frankfurt and Riga Mainz GmbH & Co. KG erected three Liebherr 8-axle mobile cranes for the refurbishment of two historic railway bridges at a crossing used by Deutsche Bundesbahn in Darmstadt. After hoisting out the listed steel structures, they were positioned on a nearby asphalt surface. The bridges are currently being refurbished in that location. Massive mobile cranes are scheduled to return in autumn this year to hoist the two bridges back into the original positions.Find out more",Press releases,03/17/2021,"The order for the refurbishment of the bridge structures was awarded to construction contractor Adolf Lupp, which asked Eisele to complete the crane work. In turn, Eisele brought Riga Mainz on board as a partner to assist it with this order. The bridge structure, which consists of two separate steel bridges, routes a single track over a double track section operated by Deutsche Bundesbahn.Both bridges measure 40 metres in length, 13.65 metres in width and 5.3 metres in height and weigh in at 160 tonnes. For the refurbishment work, the two steel structures had to be positioned on 1.5 metre high concrete elements positioned on a nearby asphalt surface. As the mobile cranes were unable to access this area, the bridges were hoisted out and then loaded onto SPMTs. The 6-axle heavy duty modules then transported the massive components to the intended position with the unloading operation being carried out by the SPMTs’ hydraulic systems.. The position of the first bridge and the fact that it had to be hoisted over a 12.9 metre overhead cable mast made the job a major challenge. Therefore, the first hoist was carried out by Riga’s brand new LTM 1650-8.1 working with Eisele’s LTM 1500-8.1. Both cranes were ballasted with 165 tonnes of counterweights. The LTM 1650-8.1, with its telescopic boom extended to a length of 33.8 metres, hoisted a weight of 88.2 tonnes at a radius of 19.1 metres. The remaining 85 tonnes were hoisted by the LTM 1500-8.1 using its 31.7 metre telescopic boom at a radius of 16.4 metres.. Whilst hoisting out the second steel bridge, Eisele’s LTM 1500-8.1, which was standing in the middle, worked with an LTM 1450-8.1 from Riga Mainz, fitted with 134 tonnes of ballast. The 450 tonne crane had to manage a load of 85 tonnes on its 31.9 metre telescopic boom at a radius of 15.5 metres. The third crane was required as it was not possible to move the cranes around the site between hoists due to a lack of time.. Uwe Langer, Managing Director at Riga Mainz, took responsibility for planning the crane hoists and was on site in person as the bridges were hoisted out. He says: “The new LTM 1650-8.1 really impressed me. As it hoisted the heavy bridge, the crane performed as if it had nothing on its hook. The boom and the chassis are a masterpiece of design. It’s fantastic – a spectacular machine in this crane class! The LTM 1650-8.1 will impress the whole crane world – I am convinced of that”..

Top-class logistics: 25 Liebherr tower cranes at work on the Überseequartier district in Hamburg’s HafenCity area,Press releases |03/12/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/top-class-logistics-25-liebherr-tower-cranes-at-work-on-the-ueberseequartier-district-in-hamburgs-hafencity-area.html?page=71,"25 Liebherr tower cranes are involved in the construction of the Überseequartier, a new district in Hamburg. This is part of the well-known HafenCity urban development project and comprises 14 buildings of various types. Liebherr is working closely with dealer Feurig and contractor Züblin on the project’s planning and implementation.Find out more",Press releases,03/12/2021,"The first crane was assembled at the beginning of 2019. Today, there are more than 20 cranes in simultaneous operation. The planning and implementation of this major project has required patience and exceptional levels of collaboration between all parties involved.Concept, planning & project developmentAt the start of the project in 2018, Züblin’s site managers decided on equipping the entire construction site with machinery from a single manufacturer in order to meet logistical requirements. They opted for Liebherr and Feurig. Feurig has over 200 rental cranes of all sizes at its rental park in Hamburg. 15 well-qualified service technicians are available for assembly and service work.14 individual buildings of various types are being built on the site, which covers 419,000 square metres. These range from an office tower and residential buildings to a cinema and a shopping centre. A cruise terminal is also included. The original idea was to allocate a crane to each building. However, as planning progressed, Liebherr’s project department, the Tower Crane Solutions, quickly identified that further cranes would be required to ensure a cost-effective handling capacity across the entire site. They calculated an average of one and a half cranes per building. With everyone working together, a clever crane concept involving a total of 25 Liebherr tower cranes was developed.Having so many cranes in a relatively small area is challenging in terms of planning and logistics, as all cranes must be positioned so that each one is safe from colliding with others and with surrounding buildings. This is why the variously sized Liebherr tower cranes have hook heights ranging from just under 30 metres to over 90 metres. The crane types themselves range from 85 EC-B and 172 EC-B cranes to the 280 EC-H model; the majority are flat tops. Although it wasn’t initially prioritised for all 25 cranes to work on site at the same time, external circumstances and Covid-19 led to this being a reality. Tower Crane Solutions factored this possibility into the planning from the outset.. Long-term project support – Fast responses to unforeseeable structural changesAs a support specialist, Tower Crane Solutions was on hand to provide advice and assistance during the project’s planning phase and continues to do so throughout its implementation. An example of this support in action was when a chimney on a neighbouring property acquired scaffolding for its restoration, which extended the width of the chimney by around two metres. This had an impact on one of the tower cranes on site. Raising the height of the crane wasn’t possible for structural reasons. So, a shortening of the jib was calculated without further ado. This was the simplest, quickest and most cost-effective solution. On the recommendation of Tower Crane Solutions, the construction site was able to continue to run smoothly and efficiently.“Cosmopolitan, open and urban”According to the website of the German shopping centre group Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, the Überseequartier development is “cosmopolitan, open and urban – a place like no other”. Designed as an integrated district and a key element of Hamburg’s HafenCity, it connects places to live and work with attractive cultural offers and leisure facilities as well as innovative retail and entertainment concepts. A state-of-the-art cruise terminal is set to be an additional highlight. The end result will be a vibrant meeting place for both locals and tourists.

First main components of Liebherr HLC 150000 ready for installation on Alfa Lift,Press releases |03/10/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/first-main-components-of-liebherr-hlc-150000-ready-for-installation-on-alfa-lift.html?page=72,"In the afternoon on March 7, 2021, the deck cargo ship “BigLift Barentsz” left the Liebherr site at the port of Rostock with two remarkable, giant crane components ready for installation. The white painted slewing platform, as well as the characteristic A-frame of the upcoming Heavy Lift Crane HLC 150000, are now on their way to being assembled on OHT’s next-generation offshore wind foundation vessel Alfa Lift. With its unique combination of features, the Liebherr HLC series will be a key element for installing current and future wind farms around the world.Find out more",Press releases,03/10/2021,"Following their arrival in China, the slewing platform and the A-frame will be the first crane sections to be assembled on the Ulstein designed offshore installation vessel Alfa Lift. The tandem lift of the two large components was realised at the Liebherr site in Rostock using two strong representatives of their kind: the LR 11350 crawler crane and the TCC 78000, once again proving the importance of this powerful rail-mounted heavy-duty gantry crane. Due to the lifts taking place directly at the quay, the transportation vessel was able to start its journey by taking the shortest route to the Baltic Sea. The slewing platform and the A-frame will be assembled on Alfa Lift at the shipyard of China Merchants Heavy Industry (CMHI) in the province Jiangsu, close to Shanghai. When the installation of the two components is finalised, the boom will be delivered just-in-time to complete the HLC 150000.“The crane can only be assembled and installed once the vessel has reached a specific phase in its construction. Therefore, the manufacturing timelines are finely balanced between Liebherr, OHT, and CHMI. Another important element of the partnership with OHT is our support and guidance for the initial setup of the crane onboard Alfa Lift. Due to the extensive experience of our experts, a team of Liebherr specialists will travel to China and support with supervision for the installation, commissioning and testing process (ICT) of the HLC 150000 at the shipyard,” said Gregor Levold, Sales Director of Ship and Offshore Cranes at Liebherr Rostock.Bjarne Birkeland, Head of Vessel Management for OHT, said: “We have recently reached a significant milestone in the construction of Alfa Lift with the launch of the vessel and we are grateful to see the high-quality Liebherr 3000 tonnes Heavy Lift Crane components being shipped from their facilities ready for the next big milestone. We look forward to seeing the crane installed on the vessel and thank the experts at Liebherr for their excellent cooperation and diligence.”. Optimised for future wind park installationsWith a maximum lifting capacity of 3,000 tonnes at 30 metres and 1,000 tonnes at 76 metres outreach, the HLC 150000 is ready for a wide range of applications. In general, the Liebherr HLC series design is characterised by a small footprint. The slew bearing diameter of the HLC 150000 is just 14 metres, consequently, the crane requires little space on deck and offers more storage space. Due to the special slip ring configuration, the HLC has a 360-degree unlimited slewing range.In addition, the Liebherr HLC’s foldable A-frame reduces the height of the crane as needed. “Unlike many other crane vessels of this size, the Alfa Lift will be able to navigate waters crossed by bridges. This feature reduces transit-time, for instance when the vessel enters the Baltic Sea crossing the Storebaltsbroen in Denmark. The foldable A-frame provides more flexibility, which in turn leads to both operational and cost-efficiency, increasing the number of charter days and vessel availability,” said Gregor Levold.For faster maintenance during operation, all components of the HLC are safely accessible via stairs and platforms. A key element of the maintenance concept is the integrated telescopic knuckle boom crane that is capable of lifting up to six tonnes. This service crane allows the exchange of the heaviest single components without the help of an external crane. This means a comfortable, fast, economical maintenance is guaranteed, independent of the vessel location.. High interest for shaping the energy revolution The heavy lift crane series at Liebherr serves a worldwide growing market in offshore wind installation contributing to a sustainable energy provision. At the same time, existing offshore oil and gas installations will be decommissioned in larger sections to reduce transport costs. To meet these requirements in the best way, cross-divisional development and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes are key factors for projects in both sectors. “Customers for this type of crane have very high quality and reliability demands, which we can meet and exceed. Our cranes are made in Europe with strong partners within the Liebherr Group as well as proven and reliable external suppliers. Main components like winches, slew bearing, and slewing drives of the crane are designed and manufactured by other Liebherr companies. This results in an independent supply chain and guaranteed availability of components”, said Gregor Levold. Since the feature-rich HLC series can be used for a wide variety of operations, the worldwide interest in the Liebherr heavy lift cranes keeps growing steadily.. In 2022, the HLC 150000 onboard Alfa Lift will start operating in the North Sea.

Ulferts & Wittrock orders another 31 Liebherr mobile cranes,Press releases |03/09/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/ulferts-wittrock-orders-another-31-liebherr-mobile-cranes.html?page=72,"Over the last two years, the Ulferts & Wittrock Group has taken delivery of eighty new Liebherr mobile cranes. Another order package for 31 cranes for delivery this year was signed recently. Ulferts & Wittrock is modernising its nationwide crane fleet with new Liebherr cranes. The cranes range from the LTM 1040-2.1 to the LTM 1250-5.1. Around one-third of the machines ordered are in the 5-axle class.Find out more",Press releases,03/09/2021,"The new order package includes a large number of the new LTM 1150-5.3. Marcus Wittrock, Managing Partner at Ulferts & Wittrock, explains: “The new Liebherr 150 tonne crane enables us to expand our 5-axle class perfectly as it delivers excellent lifting capacities, a very long telescopic boom and can carry a good deal of ballast on public roads.”Liebherr unveiled the LTM 1150-5.3 in October last year as the successor to the successful LTM 1130-5.1. With a maximum lifting capacity of 150 tonnes and a 66 metre telescopic boom, it is the perfect addition to Liebherr’s crane range below the 180 tonne LTM 1160-5.2. The 10 percent longer telescopic boom compared to its predecessor will, on average, hoist 15 percent higher loads with both maximum and part ballast. And with this in mind, the Liebherr engineers have produced a minor miracle – the new crane has the same low gross weight as its predecessor. With an axle load of twelve tonnes, the crane can carry nine tonnes of ballast on public roads.Ulferts & Wittrock and Liebherr have had a long term partnership. “We feel that Liebherr takes good care of us. The cranes are state of the art in technical terms. Furthermore, they retain the value very well and are therefore in great demand as used cranes”, are the reasons Temmo Niekamp, also a Managing Partner at Ulferts & Wittrock, says are behind the company’s decision to continue to modernise its crane fleet with Liebherr mobile cranes.Managing Partner Oliver Herrmann continues: “In our industry, the high availability of cranes is essential. That means we are reliant on excellent after-sales service with reliable, fast supplies of spare parts. That is where Liebherr is exemplary.”The Ulferts & Wittrock GroupUlferts & Wittrock was founded in Oldenburg in 1989 and started its journey to become a logistics service provider in the heavy load sector with five mobile cranes. The company grew steadily as the number of wind turbines requiring erection increased. Today, Ulferts & Wittrock has a number of sites in Germany and a fleet of the very latest mobile cranes with lifting capacities between 30 and 600 tonnes, crawler cranes with lifting capacities between 130 and 650 tonnes, mobile construction cranes, work platforms and telescopic forklift trucks as well as various heavy haulage trucks..

They are in operation in Melbourne for inner-city public transport since 2002."
Model update: Liebherr introduces performance increase to L 550 and L 556 XPower® wheel loaders,Press releases |03/05/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/model-update-liebherr-introduces-performance-increase-to-l-550-and-l-556-xpower-wheel-loaders.html?page=72,"In the five years since their debut, Liebherr’s XPower® large wheel loaders have established themselves as forerunners in terms of fuel efficiency and stability. Liebherr is now updating two models in the series - the L 550 XPower® and L 556 XPower®. To further boost performance, Liebherr has reinforced the lift arms and overhauled the working hydraulics. Innovations also include increased tip load, breakout force and engine power. The two performance-optimised models are now available to order from all Liebherr sales partners.Find out more",Press releases,03/05/2021,"The Liebherr L 550 XPower® and L 556 XPower® wheel loaders are used primarily in industrial operations such as in waste disposal. Paper handling, bulky metal scrap and refuse slag pose a particular challenge to a machine fleet. ""We remain in close contact with our customers and understand the tough conditions at landfill sites and recycling centres. With this in mind, we have purposefully invested in the performance and versatility of our two wheel loaders as part of our model updates"", explains Mark Walcher, product manager at Liebherr-Werk Bischofshofen GmbH.. Increased performance - a more powerful engine and improved working hydraulicsBoth the L 550 XPower® and L 556 XPower® wheel loaders are equipped with the power-split travel drive, installed as standard in all Liebherr XPower® wheel loaders. By increasing the engine power on both models, the travel drive is even more powerful with consistently low consumption, such as when accelerating or penetrating into material - and it’s no different when the wheel loaders are equipped with heavy protective devices or solid rubber tyres for industrial operations.An increase in performance in the working hydraulics has enabled dynamic lift and tip functions, irrespective of the size or weight of the working tool. Structural modifications to the lift arms have paved the way for higher breakout, holding and retrieval forces than before. As a result, operators are now able to efficiently manipulate challenging materials such as scrap metal, paper, compost and logs, particularly in the upper lifting range.. Four lift arm versions available according to operationsFor the L 550 and L 556 XPower® wheel loaders, Liebherr offers four lift arm versions in the form of z-bar kinematics and industrial kinematics both in standard and high lift configurations. Customers can choose which of the four versions best meets their requirements at the time of ordering. Liebherr has overhauled all four versions of the lift arms as part of the model update, as well as reinforcing the steel construction.The modified z-bar kinematics on the L 550 and L 556 wheel loaders offers strength in the lower lifting range and higher breakout forces than before. The maximum force is produced when, for example, the bucket or attachment is working close to the ground and breaks material out of a pile. This is an important feature when picking up and loading rocks, gravel or construction debris.Liebherr has also overhauled the industrial kinematics of both wheel loaders. The industrial kinematics is tailored to industrial operations that frequently require operators to work with heavy working tools such as light material buckets, high dump buckets and log grapplers. In addition, the industrial kinematics offers parallel guidance, which is ideal for operating forklifts.The high lift version (one for both z-bar and industrial kinematics) has extended lift arms for increased reach and more productive loading at a great height.. Versatility thanks to increased tip load and range of equipment optionsThe overhaul of the lift arms has increased the tip load, which means that operators of the new L 550 XPower® and L 556 XPower® can work with larger buckets than before, and move more material in each loading process. Liebherr has taken this as an opportunity to reconfigure the design of the buckets on both models. Consequently, customers can now more accurately tailor the individual modules and wear parts of the buckets to their needs at the time of ordering.The fully automatic LIKUFIX quick coupler system, historically a feature of Liebherr hydraulic excavators, is being made available for the L 550 XPower® and L 556 XPower® wheel loaders for the first time which will revolutionise operations involving multiple attachments or tools. The LIKUFIX quick coupler system allows operators to safely and conveniently switch mechanical and hydraulic attachments and tools from inside the cab at the press of a button.Additional equipment allows both XPower® wheel loaders to be prepared for customer-specific requirements. In addition, a hydraulic quick coupler with optimised visibility is also available when requested by the customer, as well as a range of assistance systems. The latter includes active personnel detection at the rear with a new braking assistant, designed to increase safety in day-to-day operations..

30 years in the ground – LTM 1500-8.1 removes 104-tonne tower crane foundation,Press releases |03/04/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/30-years-in-the-ground-ltm-1500-8-1-removes-104-tonne-tower-crane-foundation.html?page=72,"For over 30 years, there has been an enormous concrete foundation under the floor slab of a department store in Herne. It was rediscovered when the building was demolished. As the foundation was above an underground railway tunnel, it was not possible to crush it in situ. Therefore, a 500 tonne LTM 1500-8.1 mobile crane from crane and heavy haulage specialist Autokrane Schares GmbH based in Bocholt was used to remove the foundation and place it in an open space, where it was then crushed using heavy machinery.Find out more",Press releases,03/04/2021,"At the end of the 80s, an enormous top-slewing crane was erected in Bahnhofstrasse in Herne for the construction of a department store. A square concrete foundation with a side length of 5.5 metres and a depth of 1.4 metres ensured its firm footing. After the construction work had been completed, the 104 tonne colossus was left under the floor slab of the building. When the department store was demolished recently, the foundation reappeared.. Normally it would have been crushed in situ by the demolition contractor using hydraulic hammers. However, as it was located immediately above an underground railway tunnel, that method was simply not possible. This meant that a powerful mobile crane had to be brought to the site to remove the enormous foundation in full. Schares sent its Liebherr LTM 1500-8.1, which was then ballasted with 105 tonnes of counterweight at the site. The telescopic boom was extended to a length of 31.7 metres to hoist the foundation out using a radius of 13 metres and deposit it in an open space, where the demolition machines could finish the job..

More LHM – More Business,Press releases |03/03/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/more-lhm-%E2%80%93-more-business.html?page=72,"Karmsund Havn IKS has just signed a contract for a second Liebherr LHM 550. Only three years ago, Karmsund Havn ordered their first Liebherr mobile harbour crane, type LHM 550.Find out more",Press releases,03/03/2021,"Business is booming at Haugesund Cargo Terminal. This positive development for the port of Karmsund is closely linked to the purchase of a Liebherr LHM 550 mobile harbour crane in 2019. The newly acquired crane has allowed container and heavy lift handling to flourish. “We have been very satisfied with our LHM 550, and with our collaboration with Liebherr. We have had far higher activity on the first crane than expected. Investing in a second LHM 550 after only 2 years of operation with the first one, says a lot about the development at the terminal, and also about the expectations for further growth,” reports Tore Gautesen, Karmsund Port Director.Double capacity for the offshore wind industryThe port of Karmsund is one of the largest ports in the region and now wants to become the top port address in Norway. For this reason, the port recently decided to order anotherLHM 550 mobile harbour crane from Liebherr Maritime in Rostock, Germany. Above all, another crane is needed for the ever-growing project cargo business and for the booming offshore wind industry. A big advantage is the possibility to use both cranes for tandem lifts and thus even double the total crane capacity. “We are deeply involved in the project market and have the best equipment fleet in Norway for heavy lifting. The investment in crane number two will also give us great opportunities to position the terminal when handling modules for offshore wind turbines, as the crane offers possibilities for tandem lifts with crane number one with a total capacity of 308 tonnes,” Tore Gautesen continues.Electric drive for zero emissionsThe harbour crane will be operated on electricity, which corresponds with Karmsund Port Authority’s vision that the port should, as far as possible, be operated under the principles “Lean – Clean – Green”. The crane will be able to operate the entire dock area at Husøy, and is equipped for handling containers, bulk cargo and project loads. “The new mobile harbour crane will, like crane number one, be powered by electricity. This is in line with the Port of Karmsund's goal of a green port,” adds Tore Gautesen. The new machine has a maximum lifting capacity of up to 154 tonnes and a maximum outreach of 54 metres. It will be shipped fully assembled by the heavy load carrier Meri from Rostock, Germany to Karmsund, Norway in March.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Following the presentation of the world first Liebherr-Powerbloc at Bauma 2019, the truck mounted concrete pump 42 XXT with the Powerbloc pump unit was able to demonstrate its capabilities several times.Find out more",Press releases,03/03/2021,"The 42 M5 XXT truck mounted concrete pump has now been in constant use at Betonpumpen-Union (BPU) in and around Ulm for two years. Most recently even during the concreting of a very massive base plate at the Liebherr factory in Ehingen, where mobile and crawler cranes are manufactured. To ensure the consistently high quality of Liebherr cranes, a highly load-bearing test area is necessary. For this purpose, a testing plate consisting of around 750 m³ of concrete was pumped with the help of the 42 M5 XXT truck mounted concrete pump. The full concreting work was completed in just one working day. Another Liebherr truck mounted concrete pump, the 37 XXT, was also on site.. Unique Powerbloc drive unitA major highlight of the new 42 M5 XXT truck mounted concrete pump is the newly developed Liebherr-Powerbloc drive unit. It is characterised in particular by the complete integration of all hydraulic switching and measuring elements. This eliminates the need for numerous hydraulic hoses and other components previously required. The drive unit is therefore a true one of a kind in the concrete pump world. The outstanding features of the new system are first and foremost its high robustness and performance as well as its smooth operation.Christian Klafszky, Managing Director of BPU Ulm, is completely convinced of the operating unit after around one and a half years of site operation and confirms: “What I particularly like about this machine is the quiet and powerful operation of the pump unit. This is possible thanks to the new Powerbloc system.”The innovative drive unit is complemented by a newly designed, highly efficient semi-closed oil circuit. This guarantees that all drives are permanently supplied with both reliable and powerful hydraulic power. The system specially developed by Liebherr thus succeeds in optimally merging all the advantages of the open and closed circuits currently available on the market without their respective disadvantages. As a result, the oil volume can also be significantly reduced.At present, the Powerbloc is only available in combination with the 42 M5 XXT truck mounted concrete pump.

The Munich-based company now has the first ever LTM 1120-4.1 that Liebherr has delivered to a customer in Germany.Find out more,Press releases,03/02/2021,"The 700 tonne LTM 1650-8.1 will enable AKM to extend its range of services upwards. Managing Director Sven Bauer explains: “To date, our largest crane was a 500 tonne model. Being able to cover the 700 tonne class with the new Liebherr 8-axle crane is a major benefit for us. The LTM 1650-8.1 is much more flexible and mobile compared to a 9-axle model”.Bauer regards the Liebherr solution of being able to attach and remove the complete rear outrigger box in a single hoist as quick and practical. One of the main areas of use for the new crane will be erecting construction cranes using a luffing jib – in other words at sites where the mobile crane cannot get close to the construction crane. “The LTM 1650-8.1 can manage 19 tonnes with a hook height of around 80 metres without requiring guying on the telescopic boom. That is perfect for 60 metre construction cranes”, says Bauer.AKM is delighted to have received the first ever LTM 1120-4.1 in Germany: “Its performance on four axles persuaded us straight away. The compact chassis and extremely long telescopic boom at 66 metres are major benefits for urban jobs”, adds Bauer. The new 120 tonne crane will also be used for erecting tower cranes, among other things, but for the smaller models. As construction sites are often restricted, the 4-axle crane delivers some major advantages compared to 5-axle machines in the same lifting capacity class. In addition, it requires fewer permits to travel on public roads. “The LTM 1120-4.1 is extremely versatile in all areas. It requires very little space, reaches great heights and is also really powerful”, explains Bauer.AKM Autokranvermietung is part of a group with a workforce of 120 which operates around 50 mobile cranes with lifting capacities up to 700 tonnes and has one of the most powerful fleets in the Munich area with its three 8-axle cranes. Over 90 percent of its cranes are supplied by Liebherr. In addition to performance data, Sven Bauer provides some other reasons to buy from the market leader: “The downtimes of Liebherr mobile cranes are very low. But even if something does happen, the engineers are very quick to respond. The best expertise on the market at the moment. You can always rely on Liebherr, even if you have a few problems.”.

One thing is certain – the future of cooling will feature even greater convenience and the fridge will become a true hero of everyday life that you can always rely on.You can find more information at: Liebherr Innovation 2021"
Innovative and individual:Liebherr launches a new range of fully integrated appliances,Press releases |03/01/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/innovative-and-individual-liebherr-launches-a-new-range-of-fully-integrated-appliances.html?page=73,"Liebherr reveals the future of refrigeration and freezing with its new fully integrated appliances: The specialist is focusing more strongly than ever on technical innovations, exemplary energy efficiency and intelligent features in its new generation of appliances. With these developments, Liebherr has made the almost impossible possible. Not only will individual model groups and niches be launched, the specialist manufacturer will also convert the complete range of fully integrated appliances to the new generation from April.Find out more",Press releases,03/01/2021,"“We haven’t reinvented the refrigerator. But we almost did.” Liebherr is launching its new range of fully integrated appliances with this bold slogan – and at the same time showing customers what they can expect: A variety of innovations that make life easier and more convenient. Because this is where design meets functionality. All features have been specifically designed to meet customer needs. “For us, a refrigerator is more than just an appliance. It should be a reliable partner that provides assistance, thinks for itself, takes over tasks and helps make work easier. That’s why we asked ourselves at the beginning of the development project: How can we make our appliances even more efficient, intuitive and contemporary?” says Steffen Nagel, Managing Director of Sales & Marketing at Liebherr-Hausgeräte GmbH.Liebherr provides the answers to this question in four series, on a scale from Pure, Plus, Prime and Peak. Whether it’s a basic or high-end appliance: All new models are full of smart features and are all of the highest quality. That’s because Liebherr, as a traditional family-owned company, stands for longevity and sustainability. Solid “Made in Germany” and high-quality materials are the basis of every single appliance. Even the smallest details meet this high quality standard.“Before we approve a door hinge, for example, it must undergo at least 100,000 opening cycles. That’s the equivalent of more than 15 years of use. After all, we want our customers to enjoy their refrigerators for a long time,” explains Nagel.. More freshness every time the door is openedThe new HydroBreeze function, for example, is likely to be particularly popular with customers: Each time the door is opened, the fruit and vegetables in the BioFresh safe are covered with a fresh, cold mist that spreads over the produce like a protective balm. This gentle layer of moisture, combined with a temperature of just above 0 °C, increases the surface tension and preserves the structure of the food.And there’s even more freshness in the new refrigerators: for example, the IceMaker, which produces up to 130 ice cubes a day. This is an ample amount of ice for cocktails and successful garden parties. Another innovation in the fully integrated appliances is the InfinitySpring – a water fountain in the fridge: The integrated water dispenser provides filtered cold water at all times.The specialist manufacturer also sets standards in terms of noise levels: Some of the appliances are extremely quiet and only emit 29 dB(A) of noise, meaning that they can be labelled in the best noise category, class A. This makes them barely perceptible, even to noise-sensitive ears. As kitchen spaces are increasingly merging with living areas, this is an important advantage that is becoming more and more relevant in modern living concepts.And even although the fully integrated models are full of technical refinements and conveniences, they still occupy top positions in the efficiency rankings. “Due to new measurement procedures and calculation methods, the values of the old energy label are no longer comparable with the new values,” explains Steffen Nagel. “As we have been manufacturing particularly energy-efficient refrigerators at Liebherr for many years now, the latest range of fully integrated appliances with the new label also consistently achieves top ratings – up to class B.”Of course, one thing goes without saying: The new fully integrated appliances are, without exception, “smart”. All models are either pre-equipped for networking at the plant or can be connected to a WiFi network later via a SmartDeviceBox. Customers can use the SmartDevice app to integrate their refrigerator quickly and conveniently into an existing smart home environment.Thanks to the multitude of new and enhanced features, the fully integrated appliances from the refrigeration specialist based in Ochsenhausen, southern Germany, are true all-rounders that not only reliably keep food fresh, but also offer more convenience in everyday life. At the same time, they are economical and sustainable.You can find more information at: Liebherr Innovation 2021About Liebherr-Hausgeräte GmbHLiebherr-Hausgeräte GmbH is one of eleven divisional controlling companies of the Liebherr Group.

New EU energy label: Liebherr-Hausgeräte highlights its leading role in energy efficiency,Press releases |03/01/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-eu-energy-label-liebherr-hausger%C3%A4te-highlights-its-leading-role-in-energy-efficiency.html?page=73,"Parallel to the introduction of the new EU energy label, Liebherr-Hausgeräte is building on its leading role in sustainability and exemplary energy efficiency with its new range of particularly energy-efficient built-in appliances and through comprehensive and transparent customer information on the new aspects of the EU energy label.Parallel to the introduction of the new EU energy label, Liebherr-Hausgeräte is building on its leading role in sustainability and exemplary energy efficiency with its new range of particularly energy-efficient built-in appliances and through comprehensive and transparent customer information on the new aspects of the EU energy label.Find out more",Press releases,03/01/2021,"The new EU energy label will be officially introduced on 1 March. This means that the old label with its extended subclasses, such as A+++, which have recently become increasingly complex for customers, will now become obsolete. The new label will rank appliances on an efficiency scale from A to G. This will once again make it easier for customers to quickly identify particularly energy-efficient appliances.However, before its introduction, all manufacturers, including Liebherr-Hausgeräte, face a communication challenge: “Due to new measurement procedures and calculation methods, the values of the old label are no longer comparable with the new values,” explains Steffen Nagel, Managing Director of Sales & Marketing at Liebherr-Hausgeräte GmbH.For example, according to the new standard, tests are now carried out at two different ambient temperatures instead of the previous one. In order to create room for future innovations in energy efficiency, and to avoid exhausting the entire scale right from the start, the upper classes of A and B are extremely difficult to achieve. “This means that previous A+++ appliances will carry a B, C or D label in future, even though they consume just as little energy as before,” says Nagel.Since Liebherr-Hausgeräte has already been developing and producing particularly energy-efficient appliances for many years, Liebherr’s refrigerators achieve consistently good ratings even with the new label. This applies all the more to the brand new range of built-in appliances, which will be available from April. Liebherr’s developers have once again succeeded in significantly reducing energy consumption.What’s more, Liebherr-Hausgeräte has already been fitting their appliances with both the old and new labels since 1 September 2020 – two months before the official date when it becomes mandatory. “Our aim was to support retail in the best possible way and to keep the additional effort required during this transition period as low as possible,” Nagel explains.In order to create transparency and provide information about the innovations in the rating system for the EU energy label, Liebherr has developed a standardised communication concept. This concept helps Liebherr’s retail partners to familiarise customers with the new energy label. “It was very important to us to closely involve retail in the communication. For this reason we have devised clear and comprehensive communication for the various touchpoints,” explains Steffen Nagel.You can find more information: Liebherr.

Liebherr-Hausgeräte is switching to the new EU energy label and continues to impress with its energy efficiency ,News |03/01/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-hausger%C3%A4te-is-switching-to-the-new-eu-energy-label-and-continues-to-impress-with-its-energy-efficiency-news.html?page=73,"On 1 March 2021, the EU will be introducing a new energy label to make it easier for consumers to recognise the efficiency of electrical appliances and identify energy-saving products more quickly. Liebherr is also doing its bit to help the climate with a new and highly energy-efficient series of fully integrated appliances.Find out more",News,03/01/2021,"More transparency for more sustainabilityThe EU energy label classifies electrical devices according to their energy consumption and is intended to increase the demand for efficient products. Due to increasing complexity, the previous labels offered consumers little transparency in recognising differences in efficiency. The new label returns to the original A to G efficiency scale. Classifications like A+++ are therefore a thing of the past.In the current transition phase, Liebherr refrigerators and freezers are marked with both the old and new labels. New measurement and calculation methods means that the values are no longer fully comparable – which poses a challenge for manufacturers such as Liebherr-Hausgeräte in terms of communication. “This means that appliances previously rated A+++ will now have a B, C or D label, even though they consume just as little energy as before,” says Steffen Nagel, Head of Sales and Marketing at Liebherr-Hausgeräte GmbH. To provide the incentive for future efficiency innovations, the higher ratings are harder to achieve than before, but the refrigerators and freezers from Liebherr still have consistently impressive ratings even under the new system – particularly in the case of the new sustainable fully integrated appliances which Liebherr will be launching in April.You can find more information at: Liebherr"

Guindastes Tatuapé enlarges fleet with new LTM 1500-8.1 after 30 years of great partnership with Liebherr,Press releases |02/25/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/guindastes-tatuape-enlarges-fleet-with-new-ltm-1500-8-1-after-30-years-of-great-partnership-with-liebherr.html?page=73,"Guindastes Tatuapé, based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, purchased a new LTM 1500-8.1. The 8-axle giant is the 27th crane Tatuapé bought from Liebherr in the last 20 years. Being one of the largest crane rental companies in Brazil, Tatuapé has a growing fleet of mobile cranes, operating throughout Brazil and the surrounding countries in South America. The new 500 t crane will first serve in the assembling of a pulp and paper mill.Find out more",Press releases,02/25/2021,"Back in 1988, the company owner of Guindastes Tatuapé, Edson Garzon Esparbiere, paid a visit to the Liebherr plant in Ehingen, Germany. He met Dr. Hans Liebherr, founder of the Liebherr Group, personally. It was the beginning of a great partnership, growing over years, and Tatuapé bought more and more mobile cranes from Liebherr. For Tatuapé not only the technology and value of the cranes itself are important, but also the service and customer support. “The Liebherr equipment is the best in the world. Both, in terms of productivity and resale value,” states Denys Garzon Rodrigues, Commercial Director of Tatuapé Guindates proudly.New LTM 1500-8.1 for industrial purposeThe latest addition to the fleet, a LTM 1500-8.1, will be contracted directly to assist in the assembly of a new pulp and paper mill in Brazil. The reason to invest in such a large crane was pretty simple for Tatuapé. “The LTM 1500-8.1 is a very versatile piece of equipment. In addition to the fantastic load charts with nearly endless possibilities, the crane with its two boom lengths of 50 and 84 meters, the luffing jib and the fixed jib offer everything you need for many requirements in our markets,” explains Denys Garzon. “And we do have already two similar cranes succesfull running in our fleet, where we can now also exchange some of the equipment. That pays off and makes the whole thing highly profitable”, he adds.Brazil and beyond“Bearing in mind that we have a young machine park in Brazil, in average age, we are able to serve the growing market needs pretty well”, Denys Garzon goes on. “Our fleet ranges from mobile cranes with 7t tons up to 800 t. And with this huge range of cranes, we are able to serve nearly all jobs inside and outside of Brazil, also working beyond the Brazilian borders, in South America - where we just started our first operation recently”, he explains.Proud company historyToday, Guindastes Tatuapé employs approx. 250 employees. Running a fleet of cranes, conveyor sets, forklifts and lifting platforms with more than 230 machines, the company serves at national level to the most diverse market segments. Almost 30 mobile cranes from Liebherr have been added to the fleet in the past twenty years.Founded back in 1950 by Pedro Garzon, Grupo Tatuapé started with a truck that can still be seen in their own museum. The money for the truck was loaned from a neighbor. The truck was parked in Praça Silvio Romero, a neighborhood in São Paulo, and Pedro started searching for work with it. In the beginning small jobs like the transport of refrigerators and furniture came up. But then, he was tasked to transport a 2 tons weaving machine. First, Garzon claimed he did not have the right equipment for such a heavy work. But nonetheless he accepted the challenge, took a bus to Rio de Janeiro, bought a wire rope winch and brought it in the bus back to Sao Paulo. This was the beginning of the heavy cargo handling for Tatuapé. Edson Garzon Esparbiere and Suely Garzon, Pedro’s childrentook over the business later on, enlarging the company. Today the company is run by the third generation and in the hands of the Directors Denys Garzon and Daniel Garzon.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Belgium: Ijzerland opts for R 944 C High Rise electric crawler excavator,Press releases |02/24/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/belgium-ijzerland-opts-for-r-944-c-high-rise-electric-crawler-excavator.html?page=74,"Ijzerland, the Belgian specialist in recycling scrap metal, was on the hunt for a versatile machine that would generate zero emissions on site. In order to guarantee employee satisfaction, the excavator was also required to unite precision with comfort.Find out more",Press releases,02/24/2021,"After working with excavators from a range of manufacturers, Ive Van Frausum, Managing Director of Ijzerland, is impressed by the quality of the Liebherr machines: “The Liebherr excavators are the best in the world”. One of the company’s objectives is to reduce its exhaust emissions and become more environmentally friendly.The Liebherr dealer SOMTP Belgique therefore recommended the R 944 C High Rise electric crawler excavator. This machine, which weighs in at around 74 tonnes, belongs to a range of three material handling machines that are fully electric: The R 934 C, R 944 C and R 954 C. In accordance with customer requirements, these models are available in three different versions: Material handling, high rise and pontoon. SOMTP Belgique will take care of customer service. The collaboration is running without a hitch: Ijzerland values the close proximity of the dealer in equal measure to the quality and speed of the services they provide.. Decision in favour of power and versatilityThe company opted in favour of a multi-purpose machine in order to utilise the range of tools required for various tasks a the scrap recycling facility. The operator uses the R 944 C to move scrap steel to the shredder. The steel is then compressed, temporarily stored along the loading ramp on the canal bank, before being transported away by ship.In this instance the R 944 C is equipped with a five-arm grapple, which enables it to handle steel parts of varying sizes. The height-adjustable driver’s cab and turret facilitate safe work, whilst also optimising the field of vision. The reach of 24 m and the powerful electric motor (200 kW) guarantee maximum excavator performance when it comes to lifting force, precision and working speed. Further advantages of the excavator include its mobility - facilitated by the crawler track travel gear - and the working height, which is ideal for industrial processes such as scrap metal recycling.Scrap metal recycling is a complex and time-intensive operation. This form of processing demands a great deal of space. The location of the recycling plant directly on the canal allows optimum transport on the waterway.. An environmentally friendly solutionThe most important values of Ijzerland include environmental protection and the reduction of exhaust gas emissions, and the company’s managing director is therefore particularly pleased with the electric motor that powers the excavator. The excavator is equipped with an 11.50 m long industrial monobloc jib. The electric motor guarantees low noise emissions in the working area and cab, and the lack of vibrations ensures added operator comfort. The driver’s cabs in the electric excavators offer the same comforts as those of excavators with a combustion engine: The driver has a large workspace with climate control, and an outstanding view thanks to the large glass panes. The controls are ergonomically arranged and the seat is comfortable: All this helps the operator to concentrate on their activity and to work extremely efficiently with the R 944 C High Rise. The Liebherr electric excavators deliver maximum reliability. The innovative actuator concept (a single electric motor for all hydraulic functions) makes it possible to accommodate the low voltage functions in a single control cabinet..

A Liebherr R 934 G8 crawler excavator, the first hydraulic excavator with a factory-fitted Leica Geosystems machine control system, has been delivered to our customer Brad-Pave in Great Britain.Find out more",Press releases,02/18/2021,"The partnership between Liebherr and Leica Geosystems allows Liebherr customers to purchase generation 6 and 8 crawler excavators and wheeled excavators with a factory-fitted 2D and 3D machine control system as an option. The first customer to benefit from this arrangement is a British company, Brad-Pave.The generation 8 R 934 crawler excavator comes with the Leica 3D passive system and will be soon updatedd with a semi-automatic system featuring an automatic inclination/rotation function. According to the company’s director Paul Bradshaw, the machine control system is critical. It's the key to accurate and effective work.. Choosing a Liebherr machine for quality and serviceIt was the quality and expertise of Liebherr that persuaded Paul Bradshaw to opt for a Liebherr machine. Other factors tipping the balance in Liebherr’s favour were excellent service and several possible adaptation with the machine. These are the most important considerations for this British company. On its first construction site job, the R 934 was mainly used to dig a large drainage trench across a field. The machine’s power and responsiveness were entirely to the operator’s satisfaction.The 7.1 tonne counterweight and 800 mm pads ensure good stability in all conditions. The machine has run up 350 hours on the clock since delivery. The director declares that he will definitely be coming back to Liebherr for his next purchase.

Wasel takes delivery of new Liebherr LTM 1650 8.1 mobile crane and orders new LR 1700 1.0 crawler crane,Press releases |02/17/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/wasel-takes-delivery-of-new-liebherr-ltm-1650-8-1-mobile-crane-and-orders-new-lr-1700-1-0-crawler-crane.html?page=74,"Wasel GmbH has taken delivery of a new LTM 1650-8.1 at the Liebherr Plant in Ehingen. The new crane strengthens the mobile crane fleet at the crane and heavy haulage contractor based in Bergheim. At the same time, Wasel ordered a new LR 1700-1.0 crawler crane. The excellent concept and high performance of the new 700 tonne lattice boom crane, which Liebherr only launched recently, were key features behind the decision.Find out more",Press releases,02/17/2021,"The new LTM 1650-8.1 extends the performance range of Wasel’s mobile crane fleet upwards. Thomas Wasel, who runs the business with his brother, Matthias Wasel, explains: “We decided to buy the LTM 1650-8.1 because our 500 tonne crane is now often reaching the limits of its capacity. We often need more lifting capacity, particularly for unloading machine components off ships at ports. The new crane also delivers some major benefits for erecting large construction cranes with luffing jibs.”Matthias Wasel continues: “We deliberately chose Liebherr’s new powerful 8-axle crane because it is relatively easy to handle for such a large crane. Being able to mount the complete rear outrigger box with just one hoist on site is a really good, practical solution”.Wasel is also adding to its range of crawler cranes – the company will receive an LR 11000 in autumn and has just placed an order for the newly launched LR 1700-1.0. “The significant increase in capacity compared to the LR 1600/2, whilst having similar dimensions, immediately appealed to us. It’s particularly useful for wind power jobs. In addition, the fact that we can use lots of components from our LR 1600/2, for example the complete luffing jib, is ideal for us”, says Thomas Wasel.The new LR 1700-1.0 from Liebherr combines the benefits of economical transport from crawler cranes in the 600 tonne class with the performance of lattice boom cranes in the 750 tonne class and all the innovations featured in Liebherr’s crawler crane developments from the last few years, such as the VarioTray detachable ballast pallet and the V-Frame hydraulically adjustable ballast system.Liebherr has another innovation when it comes to ballast trailers – the new modular “M-Wagon” ballast trailer is not only suitable for use with the LR 1700-1.0, but also with the LR 1800-1.0 and LR 11000 crawler cranes. “Since we do not use a ballast trailer very often, this means we can save some significant costs. It also delivers a major benefit for our crawler cranes,” says Matthias Wasel.Wasel employs more than 400 people and has a fleet of around 140 Liebherr mobile and crawler cranes. The customer focuses on providing hoisting and transport services. The company is also a Liebherr dealer for tower cranes and operates over 400 Liebherr tower cranes itself..

Liebherr presents new Smart Tyre Saving System,Press releases |02/15/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-presents-new-smart-tyre-saving-system.html?page=74,"Before the tyre temperature of a Liebherr reachstacker reaches a critical level where tyre wear would increase excessively, the new Smart Tyre System automatically reduces the machine speed. As soon as the tyres return to a low temperature level, the power is increased again. This ensures maximum performance and protects the tyres from excessive wear.Find out more",Press releases,02/15/2021,"When considering the life-cycle costs of a reachstacker, the tyres play a significant role. It is also known that overheating of the tyre is one of the main reasons for premature tyre wear. Liebherr engineers therefore took up the challenge of developing an innovative countermeasure. Customers who operate their reachstacker for more than eight hours at a time generally experience high tyre wear, regardless of which reachstacker manufacturer or tyre brand is used. The tyres tend to get very hot the longer they are used at a stretch. To prevent overheating, some customers generally reduce the speed of the reachstacker, which leads to a loss of performance and therefore efficiency.The newly developed Liebherr Smart Tyre Saving System estimates the temperature increase of the tyre based on the axle load and the speed of the reachstacker and only reduces the speed if it is necessary. This allows the reachstacker to run at full speed until the tyres threaten to become hot. As soon as the point of increased overheating is reached, the machine is briefly throttled back systemically until the tyres have reached a temperature again that does not cause increased wear. The rider can then continue to ride at full speed.. How the system worksIn several field tests, the correlation between the so-called TpKh (tonnes times kilometres per hour) value and the tyre temperature could be determined. The TpKh value relates the tyre load to the actual speed of the reachstacker and thus shows the development of the thermal tyre load. Tracking this value during operation enables a sensible reduction in speed to cool down the tyres before they reach a critical temperature. A major advantage: no additional temperature sensors are required for monitoring.Reduces tyre wear and increases efficiencyUntil now, it was common practice to generally reduce the speed of the reachstacker to avoid thermal overload of the tyre. This approach was accompanied by a general loss of handling performance. With the intelligent tyre protection for Liebherr reachstackers, a suitable solution is now available to increase handling performance and save tyre wear at the same time. The advantages are obvious. Tyre wear is reduced and thus the service life of the tyre is significantly extended. This contribution to sustainability clearly benefits the environment and also saves downtime. In addition, the short-term decrease of the machine's power does not unnecessarily reduce the general efficiency of the reachstacker. The higher efficiency and lower tyre wear save the equipment operator a lot of money in the long run.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Mobile and powerful – Liebherr unveils new 700-tonne LR 1700-1.0 crawler crane,Press releases |02/15/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/mobile-and-powerful-liebherr-unveils-new-700-tonne-lr-1700-1-0-crawler-crane.html?page=75,"After 12 years and over 200 units produced, Liebherr’s successful LR 1600/2 crawler crane now has a successor – the design of the LR 1700-1.0 with a maximum lifting capacity of 700 tonnes is based on its 600 tonne predecessor and features similar dimensions. In many respects, the new crane even exceeds the performance of the LR 1750/2. The first models of the new crane will be delivered around mid-2021, around the same time as the final LR 1600/2 units will be delivered. As deliveries of the LR 1750/2 will also cease after almost 20 years of production, the powerful LR 1700-1.0 will also assume its position below the 800 tonne LR 1800-1.0.Find out more",Press releases,02/15/2021,"The new LR 1700-1.0 from Liebherr combines the benefits of economical transport of 600 tonne class crawler cranes with the performance of 750 tonne class lattice boom cranes and also features all the innovations of Liebherr’s crawler crane developments from the last few years.Great mobility and compact dimensionsLiebherr has completely redesigned the base machine for the new LR 1700-1.0 based on the dimensions of the LR 1600/2. Its track width is slightly larger than its predecessor at 8.7 metres whilst the length of the crawler carriers has grown to 11.35 metres. The LR 1700-1.0 is available with Quick Connection as an option. This means that the transport weight of the slewing platform (without the SA frame and winches) can be reduced to around 42 tonnes, well below the limit of 45 tonnes to ensure low cost heavy haulage. The same applies to the crawler carriers which, with their 2 metre crawler pads and 4-fold drive, weigh in at just 43 tonnes. This guarantees that the new 700 tonne crane can be transported at low cost.The width of the various components is another important criterion for economic mobility. Here too, the LR 1700-1.0 produces a top performance – all the transport units for the base machine, including the pivot section, are no more than three metres in width. Only the powerful H lattice sections on the main boom are wider than this at 3.5 metres. However, these can be used to transport the smaller sections to reduce the number of transport vehicles required. For customers in countries where transport widths of over three metres are not possible, Liebherr can also supply the boom for the LR 1700-1.0 exclusively with three metre wide lattice sections.Another low cost feature for operators of the LR 1600/2 is that a large number of equipment components from the predecessor crane can also be used for the new LR 1700-1.0. These include the S sections for the main boom, the luffing jib, the 600 t head, several winches, hook blocks, ballast slabs and the runner.High performance for industry and wind power jobsThe basis of the high performance of the new 700 tonne crane is the new base machine, which delivers between 10 and 15 percent more lifting capacity. Furthermore, the 3.5 metre H lattice sections at the bottom of the main boom significantly improve the lateral stability of the entire system.This means that the new LR 1700-1.0 becomes the new benchmark in the 600 to 750 tonne class for lattice boom cranes both for classic industry work and also for wind power. The boom can be raised to a height of up to 198 metres, comprising the main boom at 102 metres and a luffing jib at 96 metres. These lattice sections enable the crane to be used in purely main boom mode with a length of up to 162 metres.For erecting wind turbines, the LR 1700-1.0 can achieve a maximum main boom length of 165 metres using additional H sections. A fixed jib of up to 15 metres in length can be attached to this. The lifting capacities of the new crane in this area are on a par with the LR 1750/2 with SX system.Minimal wear is becoming more and more important for moving the crawler travel gear, particularly during jobs at wind farms. The Liebherr engineers have therefore made the structural steelwork for the crawler carriers particularly robust and increased the size of the rollers. The 4-fold drive for the travel gear is standard.A Liebherr six cylinder diesel engine which develops 400 kW / 544 bhp is used to power the LR 1700-1.0. The engine satisfies the new stage V emissions directive and can also be configured to comply with the regulations which apply in countries outside of Europe, for example Tier 4 for the USA or stage IIIA for low regulated countries.The very latest derrick system with modular ballast trailerThe V-frame and VarioTray have more than proven their worth on the LR 1800-1.0 and LR 11000 crawler cranes. These innovative systems have therefore also been used on the LR 1700-1.0. VarioTray is a small ballast pallet, which can be unbolted quickly and easily when necessary. This avoids the need for the tiresome stacking and unstacking of ballast slabs.The V-frame ballast system is a hydraulically adjustable folding frame which enables the ballast radius of the LR 1700-1.0 to be infinitely adjusted between 13 and 21 metres. A rigid ballast guide system is therefore no longer required for large radii.Liebherr has another innovation when it comes to ballast trailers – the new modular “M-Wagon” ballast trailer is not only suitable for use with the LR 1700-1.0, but also with the LR 1800-1.0 and LR 11000 crawler cranes. Since ballast trailers are generally used quite rarely, this paves the way for significant savings. The LICCON2 control system takes charge of the sensitive control for circling, towing and parallel movements. It also delivers extended set-up facilities and monitored erection for the LR 1700-1.0..

Liebherr LTM 1230-5.1 mobile crane installs elevator shaft against the backdrop of the Frankfurt skyline,Press releases |02/11/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-ltm-1230-5-1-mobile-crane-installs-elevator-shaft-against-the-backdrop-of-the-frankfurt-skyline.html?page=75,Passers-by were treated to a rather rare site in a pedestrian zone at the end of January in Frankfurt city centre – a 5-axle mobile crane extended its long telescopic boom high above the fronts of the buildings. Hanging from its hook were components of an elevator shaft which had to be installed at the rear of one of the buildings. The red crane was the Liebherr LTM 1230-5.1 operated by Frankfurt-based crane and heavy haulage specialist Autodienst West Ganske GmbH (ADW).Find out more,Press releases,02/11/2021,"As the pedestrian zone was the only possible site for the crane, the work had to be carried out on a Sunday. Weekend work is nothing out of the ordinary for crane contractors as they regard themselves as service providers who are available at all times for their customers.One challenge was not to damage the smart paving stones of the pedestrian zone: because the supports of the Liebherr 230-tonne crane can press on the ground with up to 113 tonnes each when in use. Therefore, the ADW team first laid rubber mats on the pavement before four steel load distribution plates, each measuring nine square metres, were laid out at the designated positions of the crane supports. These plates enabled the maximum ground pressure to be limited to 12.5 tonnes per square metre.. The LTM 1230-5.1 was ballasted with 72 tonnes of counterweight for this job, because the heavier component of the lift shaft, which had to be lifted in two parts at a lifting height of 30 metres and an outreach of 40 metres, still weighed 6.5 tonnes. The crane and team completed the job with ease, which meant that the 60 tonne crane was able to leave the site again just eight hours later.The Liebherr LTM 1230-5.1 mobile crane has a 75 metre telescopic boom, making it ideal for working with the boom fully raised and at large hook heights, for example for erecting tower cranes or maintenance work for wind turbines. As the job in Frankfurt city centre showed, however, this universal crane can also easily complete jobs which require large radii.. Autodienst West Ganske GmbH has more than 75 years of experience as a crane and heavy haulage contractor. The Frankfurt-based company is now part of the Hüffermann Group, which provides a full range of crane and heavy haulage logistics services. In addition to mobile & crawler cranes with lifting capacities of up to 750 tonnes, and tower cranes, the company can also provide truck loading cranes, mini-cranes, truck work platforms, heavy installation services, traffic management & glass installation work as well as haulage services for heavy and special loads of up to 100 tonnes, including transport escort and permit services..

The cranes are identical to an STS delivered to ACOT in 2020.SEA-invest, one of the world’s largest terminal operators, has established a worldwide reputation in the fields of stevedoring, warehousing and other port-related activities in no less than 25 ports spread across two continents. In Antwerp, SEA-invest initially had a focus on bulk activities, before expanding into fruit handling and tank storage. The acquisition of a container terminal from Independent Marine Terminal in 2016, laid the groundwork for what was to become Antwerp Container Terminal. Since its inauguration, ACOT has continued to grow and the new Liebherr machines will complement the older STS cranes that came with the initial purchase of the terminal in 2016.The Liebherr STS cranes have an outreach of 60 m, a span of 30 m, a backreach of 25 m, a lift height over rail of 46 m and a safe working load of 65 tonnes under twin lift spreader. A unique feature of the cranes is that they have offset primary rocking beams to allow flexibility in future operations and can operate on quays with a span of 30.48 m as well as 30 m. The new cranes will sit on the 900 m long deep-water berth, allowing ACOT to handle super-postpanamax vessels with up to 22 rows across the deck.The Port of Antwerp continues to grow its container throughput year on year, with 2020 showing a growth of 1.3 % driven by a very strong second half despite the pandemic. The two new Liebherr STS will enhance ACOT and drive increased throughput through its terminal.Liebherr has long been a partner to SEA-invest, supplying maritime cranes for bulk since 2012. Liebherr Container Cranes Managing Director-Sales, David Griffin explained further, “As SEA-invest grows and develops in container handling, Liebherr is pleased to be able to continue the journey with them. SEA-invest has counted on Liebherr for their stevedoring operations and are accustomed to the quality, reliability and productivity that Liebherr cranes can bring.

Schwientek takes delivery of new LTM 1120-4.1 from Liebherr,Press releases |02/09/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/schwientek-takes-delivery-of-new-ltm-1120-4-1-from-liebherr.html?page=75,Mobile crane and recovery contractor Schwientek & Sohn based in Leverkusen has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1120-4.1 mobile crane. It is the first of Liebherr’s new 120 tonne crane in Germany. Liebherr unveiled the prototype at the Conexpo in Las Vegas in March 2020 with the slogan “There’s nothing more on 4!”. It is the most powerful 4-axle all-terrain crane that has ever been built and delivers a level of performance which was previously the domain of 5-axle cranes.Find out more,Press releases,02/09/2021,"At 66 metres, the LTM 1120-4.1 has the longest telescopic boom ever to have been fitted on a 4-axle mobile crane. Jörg Schwientek, owner of the 95 year old family-run company explains: “The LTM 1120-4.1 can tackle jobs which normally would require a 5-axle crane, with all the logistics work that involves. A 4-axle crane requires less work to obtain permits, which means it is much more flexible as far as we are concerned. Furthermore, the boom is the longest in this crane class and has extremely high lifting capacities when fully raised.”. The design of a 4-axle crane also enables it to tackle jobs where there is insufficient space for larger cranes. On constricted sites, in particular, Liebherr’s VarioBallast® and VarioBase innovations on the new LTM 1120-4.1 deliver enhanced performance, flexibility and safety.“Its 66 metre boom makes the new crane ideal for jobs for industrial customers. In many of our jobs in petrochemical plants with corresponding lifting heights, we often had to work with lattice jibs in the past, which we will no longer need so often with the LTM 1120-4.1. We also need the crane for positioning prefabricated concrete components and for loading machinery, erecting radio masts and tower cranes and sometimes, also for a prefabricated garage”, says Junior Manager Tim Schwientek. “This new mobile crane will replace one of our two LTM 1090-4.2 models and is a perfect addition to our fleet to extend our lifting capacities upwards.” The company will also use the crane for truck recovery work as, in addition to the crane rental division, it also provides a towing and special recovery service for vehicles of all types.. The third job tackled by the new compact crane involved it being set up with full ballast and operating up to the limit of the load chart – a ten tonne container with a powerful refrigeration system was hoisted onto the car parking level of a large supermarket building. With its telescopic boom extended to a length of around 33 metres, the LTM 1120-4.1 positioned the large air-conditioning container precisely at a radius of 21 metres. 31 tonnes of ballast and a full support base ensured that the mobile crane was stable enough to complete the job.The family-run company has a workforce of around ten and operates five mobile cranes with lifting capacities between 30 and 120 tonnes, almost all of which were supplied by Liebherr. Jörg Schwientek explains: “The standardised crane control system and flexible service management are two of the main factors behind our decision to buy from Liebherr”..

Hamburg: A new Liebherr Generation 8 crawler excavator for the Hagedorn company,Press releases |02/02/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/hamburg-a-new-liebherr-generation-8-crawler-excavator-for-the-hagedorn-company.html?page=75,"The Hagedorn company carries out earthworks, sewer construction work as well as disinfection, deconstruction and recycling projects. The company chose the Liebherr R 926 crawler excavator for earthmoving, concrete piping and laying work on a construction site in Hamburg.Find out more",Press releases,02/02/2021,"The city of Hamburg has launched a construction project to build two new logistics platforms in the Wilhelmsburg district. Since space was limited and already determined, a French architect who had already designed a two-storey logistics centre in Paris was brought in for this project - a world first. This idea is also being used for this project. The Hagedorn company is taking care of the earthworks on the site and the drainage of the rainwater that accumulates on the flat roofs of the two buildings. For these tasks, it chose an R 926 Generation 8 crawler excavator.. Opting for performance and stabilityHagedorn opted for the R 926 G8, which offers an optimal combination of performance and stability. With its 150 kW (204 bhp) exhaust stage V engine and 27.5 t operating weight, as well as a 6.20 m adjustable boom, the excavator has a high lifting capacity and is therefore perfectly suited for handling concrete pipes. The excavator is to lay the concrete pipes that connect the rainwater drains from the roofs of the two buildings to the central collection station. The excavator is equipped with a swing bucket that allows more precise earthworks on slopes. The R 926 G8 replaces the Generation 6 predecessor model of the same name, but has a more powerful engine that reduces fuel consumption while increasing performance - to the complete satisfaction of the user company. The machine has a fuel consumption of 14 litres per hour.The Hagedorn company appreciates the responsiveness and know-how of the technicians from Grotemeier, the authorised Liebherr dealer, who ensure that the machine is in perfect condition and also provide Liebherr customer service.. Cab comfort and smooth movementsThe Generation 8 crawler excavator R 926 offers great comfort for machine operator Michael Moritz. The operator has a spacious and air-conditioned work area with an air-suspended seat with height and longitudinal damping. The cab is equipped with a high-resolution 7-inch colour touchscreen. The new LED lighting is also appreciated by the machine operator and his colleagues working in the immediate vicinity, as it is more powerful and has a greater reach than the previous halogen system. A GPS guidance system was installed on the excavator to precisely position the pipelines according to the specified laying plan. Michael Moritz, the sole driver of the excavator, is nearing the end of his professional career and is thrilled that he was able to complete this assignment with such a comfortable excavator..

Job-sharing at Bracht – LTM 1450-8.1 fast-erecting crane impresses in tandem hoists,Press releases |02/01/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/job-sharing-at-bracht-ltm-1450-8-1-fast-erecting-crane-impresses-in-tandem-hoists.html?page=75,"Liebherr designed its 8-axle LTM 1450-8.1 crane for worldwide cost-effective mobility and fast, easy setup on site. It is capable of travelling on public roads with a 12-tonne axle load including its complete 85 metre telescopic boom, all four outriggers and the hoist winch. This enables it to be prepared for use very quickly once it reaches the site. It also means that two of these fast-erecting cranes completing hoists in tandem can sometimes be more economical than using a single large crane. In fact, this is a recurrent theme at crane and heavy haulage specialist Franz Bracht Kran-Vermietung GmbH.Find out more",Press releases,02/01/2021,"One LTM 1450-8.1 travelled from the Recklinghausen site and its twin from Bracht’s Duisburg site, each with 124 tonnes of ballast, to dismantle an 80 year old crane track in Duisburg port. The weight of the steel structure was quoted at 200 tonnes. However, soon became apparent on site that the crane track was significantly heavier than this. It was therefore decided to remove an overhang weighing 30 tonnes using flame cutters, whilst it was being held by one of the two LTM 1450-8.1 cranes, which then placed it on the ground.. The remainder of the construction, which then weighed around 200 tonnes, was dismantled as planned in a tandem hoist by the two 450 tonne cranes without any problems. This was a genuinely quick job – the two cranes were ready to go at six o’clock in the morning and the whole job was finished by three in the afternoon.. Exactly one week later and around 20 kilometres away, the LTM 1450-8.1 from Duisburg shared a heavy load job with an LTM 1400-7.1 from the company’s Unna site. A 110 tonne turbine had to be hoisted out of a barge at the port of Oberhausen. With lifting tackle and a triangular yoke, this meant that the gross load was 120 tonnes which the two cranes had to manage at a radius of 15.6 metres.The heavy load had to be slewed between the two cranes from the barge onto the heavy haulage vehicle sensitively and with a great deal of finesse. From attaching the load to placing it on the vehicle, the hoist lasted just 45 minutes – a quick job by any measure.. The Bracht Group, comprising Franz Bracht Kran-Vermietung GmbH, Hofmann Kran-Vermietung GmbH & Co. KG and Wilden Kran-Vermietung GmbH employees 740 people and operates around 250 cranes. The majority are supplied by Liebherr. The group’s main areas of business are the provision of crane services of all types, particularly in the lifting capacity range above 500 tonnes. The company also provides heavy haulage services. Hofmann Kran-Vermietung GmbH & Co. KG also has 200 work platforms for rental..

Liebherr remains Mobile Harbour Crane market leader ,Press releases |01/29/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-remains-mobile-harbour-crane-market-leader.html?page=75,Liebherr maritime cranes is looking back on the business year 2020 for their mobile harbour crane product segment.Find out more,Press releases,01/29/2021,"At the beginning of 2020, Liebherr Mobile Harbour Cranes was able to rely on a strong order backlog, which was already built up in 2019. The first quarter of 2020 was also very positive with several incoming orders. At the beginning of the second quarter of 2020, a decline in orders was noticeable. This was strongly linked to the corona pandemic and the resulting global lockdown.However, current projects were not cancelled but postponed. A certain amount of uncertainty was felt in the market, but in this never-before-seen situation, this behaviour was quite understandable and comprehensible. These delayed decisions led, positively speaking, to an extended summer break but not to a drastic downturn. In addition, Liebherr was able to maintain the production operation in compliance with all the required hygiene rules and in constant communication with the local health authority. During this period supply chains could be maintained.Close to the customer despite CoronaDespite the slight drop in sales in the course of the worldwide lockdown, Liebherr equipment continued to operate at ports around the world. Although the flow of goods declined for a short time, ports are systemically important, so service and support from the Liebherr customer service continued to be in demand. The worldwide well-positioned Liebherr service network has helped a lot during this time and through local mixed sales companies, dealers and partners Liebherr was always on site at the customer's location. Trade fairs and customer visits that were cancelled due to travel restrictions were also well compensated by online trade fairs, online webinars and online talk shows. In this way, the sales staff were able to maintain contact with customers, although online offers naturally do not replace personal contact.A strong fourth quarterThe Mobile Harbour Crane market was lively throughout the entire period. With the beginning of the fourth quarter 2020, we also felt a substantial recovery. Liebherr sold LHM equipment on every continent in the fourth quarter 2020 and ended the year with an order intake slightly above the level of 2019. Andreas Müller, Sales Director of Liebherr mobile harbour cranes and reachstackers comments: “This means that Liebherr remains the market leader in the mobile harbour cranes segment. This development gives grounds for optimism and provides a good base to start in 2021. A stable order intake will be the goal and a challenge in the coming year - especially due to the restrictions imposed by the corona pandemic. If we manage to achieve this, we should also achieve an increase in sales compared to 2020 - all in all, a positive forecast.”. Sales highlights 2020The purely electrical driven LPS 420 E gantry crane has more than proven itself in cargo handling at the Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port. NCSP Group has ordered two more units of this type and expects crane number two to be delivered shortly. NCSP is thus taking a further step towards an emission-free port and is developing into an environmentally conscious role model in the industry.In Argentina Liebherr sold an LHM 420 to Euroamérica in Campana. This was the first crane of its type in this South American country, it was also the first mobile harbour crane to be assembled with the help of Liebherr's new Remote Service App. Salerno Container Terminal in Italy has received its second LHM 800 in the high rise version and is thus further expanding its capacities. In Africa Liebherr recently sold two LHM 550 to the customer Ghana Ports and Harbour.Four LHM 550s were delivered to the customer ISO Limited in New Zealand. The machines are equipped with a wood grab and take timber handling there to a new level. In North America, Liebherr placed the first Liebherr mobile harbour crane in the US state of Louisiana. An LHM 550 will soon go into operation there for bulk handling at the customer Port of Lake Charles.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

New attachment from Liebherr: Expansion of range of applications of wheeled and crawler excavators ,Press releases |01/29/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-attachment-from-liebherr-expansion-of-range-of-applications-of-wheeled-and-crawler-excavators.html?page=76,"With the new ""LiTiU"" tilt unit Liebherr presents an innovative attachment which extends the swing angle of various attachments. Fixed attachments can reach swing angles of up to 2 x 75° thanks to the LiTiU unit. In addition, hydraulic attachments such as sorter grabs, swivel-mounted ditch cleaning buckets and tilt buckets can be combined with the LiTiU unit for an even bigger swing angle. LiTiU is compatible with attachments from other manufacturers. The new unit is available in different versions and sizes.Find out more",Press releases,01/29/2021,"The new Liebherr LiTiU attachment is designed for applications where the swing angle represents an extension of the working area. It allows more applications of wheeled and crawler excavators. Apart from classic excavation works, the machines can be used for levelling and modelling banks, levelling and ditch cleaning, as well as demolition and recycling, without the need to reposition the machine or change the attachment.Innovative technology complements tried-and-tested technologyLiTiU is an attachment developed by Liebherr with protected swivel motor. It is available as a direct mounting or sandwich attachment in two different sizes. As a direct mounting, LiTiU 12 or LiTiU 18 is mounted directly to the stick end of the wheeled or crawler excavator. The connection between the bottom of the LiTiU unit and the attachment is realised either with the Liebherr quick coupling system SWA 33 / SWA 48 or the fully automatic Liebherr quick coupling system SWA 33 LIKUFIX® / SWA 48 LIKUFIX®. Depending on the quick coupling system, swing angles of up to 2 x 75° are possible in this version. With the optional extended hydraulic circuit the LiTiU 18 unit can also be activated directly. As a result, the high-pressure and medium-pressure circuits are available for the functions of the attachments. There is no need to change over to the joystick control elements and productivity can be increased.Both the connection between stick end and LiTiU and the bottom of the LiTiU and attachment is realised for LiTiU 33 or LiTiU 48 in the sandwich attachment via the fully automatic Liebherr quick coupling system SWA 33 LIKUFIX® / SWA 48 LIKUFIX®. In this version swing angles of up to 2 x 50° are possible. One advantage of this attachment version is the externally routed hydraulic piping. This ensures a uniform and constant oil flow. The LiTiU 33 and LiTiU 48 units are therefore the perfect complement for attachments with their own slewing drive, such as sorter grabs or vibrating plates. But this attachment version is also beneficial for attachments such as hammers, milling machines and mulchers that do not have their own slewing drive but still require high oil quantities with low pressure losses.. Comfort and efficiency advantages thanks to LIKUFIX® There are additional comfort and efficiency advantages when the new LiTiU unit is combined with the fully automatic quick coupling system LIKUFIX®. LIKUFIX® is a hydraulic quick coupler with an automatic hydraulic coupling system. Both mechanical and hydraulic attachments on the bottom of the LiTiU can be safely exchanged from the operator's cab in a matter of seconds. Apart from quick and safe attachment changeover, the LiTiU 33 or LiTiU 48 unit can also be set down fully and the machine can be combined with another attachment.Additional applications Fixed buckets are mainly used for classic earthmoving work, such as excavation or the transport of various materials. A certain swing angle is beneficial for levelling and modelling banks or levelling and ditch cleaning work, as well as demolition or recycling. With the new LiTiU unit each fixed attachment becomes a swivel-mounted unit with increased versatility. Hydraulic attachments can also be combined with the LiTiU unit for an even bigger swing angle as can attachments from other manufacturers such as vibrating plates or mulchers. Productivity can be increased in the instance where the swing angle provides better access to difficult to reach places without the need to reposition the machine.Quick coupling systems and attachments from LiebherrWith decades of experience under it’s belt Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH develops and manufactures up to 10,000 attachments and quick coupling systems every year to the highest quality standards. They can be used both for hydraulic excavators, material handlers and wheel loaders from Liebherr, as well as for machines from other manufacturers. The portfolio ranges from quick coupling systems to digging tools for earthmoving through to grabs for diverse applications in material handling technology. In order to also be able to offer superb results in performance and productivity in the future, Liebherr is constantly developing new solutions for its attachments and quick coupling systems..

"River transportation, a long lasting success for Liebherr-Mining Equipment Colmar",Press releases |01/27/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/river-transportation-a-long-lasting-success-for-liebherr-mining-equipment-colmar.html?page=76,"Each year, about 1,000 so-called ""exceptional"" trucks were needed to transport the mining machines assembled by Liebherr-Mining Equipment Colmar SAS to the Belgian seaports to join mine sites around the world (Australia, Africa, Asia etc.).Find out more",Press releases,01/27/2021,"Before starting this project, Liebherr-Mining conducted an in-depth study on the modal shift, 50% financed by Voies Navigables de France (VNF – Inland waterway association) Strasbourg and with the help of an international consulting company. This funding is part of PARM (assistance plan for modal shifts) piloted by VNF and intended to support companies wishing to move to river transport.At the end of this study, Liebherr-Mining Equipment Colmar decided to experiment this modal shift for its pre-haulage.Established in Colmar for almost 60 years, the company decided to contribute to the development and competitiveness of the region by working with local actors. Thus, the pre-haulage from the factory to the Rhine port was entrusted to the two Alsatian carriers Straumann (Colmar) and Wack (Obernai and Drulingen) who are experienced in the region. The barging company is Haeger & Schmidt Logistics.In addition, this modal shift will optimize public tools at the Rhine Port of Colmar / Neuf-Brisach and use the nearby Rhine.The ecological resultsOne of the first positive aspects of river transport is the reduction of the environmental footprint.For the same amount of goods transported, a barge will consume three to four times less energy than a truck and emit up to five times less CO2.By reducing road traffic, noise pollution is also reduced because river transport is the quietest mode of transport.In 18 months of experimentation, Liebherr-Mining Equipment Colmar shipped 148 machines / 1,600 packages or 27,000 tonnes spread over 60 barges.For the environment, this represents a saving of 800,000 km on the road and 868,000 tonnes of CO2.A more economical and safer mode of transportRiver transportation also has numerous economical advantages. With an almost zero accident rate, the river is also a safe mode of transport: the absence of traffic saturation and the presence of loading software guarantee the perfect stability of the boats.In terms of deadlines, a machine ready for dispatch on Friday morning can be at the seaport (Antwerp or Zeebrugge) on Monday morning. A major advantage over road transport because a barge even navigates on Sundays.For many types of goods, if the flow is industrialized and if the company commits to a forecast volume, river transport is also a less expensive solution. Indeed, Liebherr in Colmar was able to save money thanks to river transport.This pre-haulage strategy initiated by the mining division has opened up a new path in the Liebherr Group. Other factories in the Group are now studying the possibility of following the same path. . DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The Minister’s visit was concluded by a round-table session that provided an opportunity for the Minister to meet with key players and a number of companies from the aeronautics sector in the region that have also benefited from the relaunch plan.Find out more",Press releases,01/27/2021,"On Friday 22 January 2021, Bruno Le Maire, the Minister of the Economy, Finance and Recovery, visited the site of Liebherr-Aerospace Toulouse SAS. The visit formed part of his trip to the region of Occitania in connection with the relaunch plan for the aviation sector. During the Minister’s visit, the Liebherr-Aerospace team presented research and technology projects being carried out in preparation for the ‘post-crisis’ era, which will also contribute towards the transformation of air transport. The common objective of all parties within France’s aeronautics sector is to develop a carbon-neutral aircraft. Following his on-site visit, the Minister convened a “round table” attended by the regional players in the aviation industry, including several companies that have benefited from the relaunch plan.Liebherr-Aerospace Toulouse SAS applied for state support within the frame of two major projects. The first, which has already benefited from the “France Relance” plan, concerns the development of a new line of products that until now had been imported, namely fluid pumps. That project represents an overall investment of around € 5 million and will be co-funded by the state to the tune of € 2.4 million. The project will enable the company to extend its range of products in the area of thermal management on-board aircraft. This will also provide innovative solutions not only to the space and the rail and road transport markets, but also to emerging markets in the area of hydrogen and fuel cells.This project involves two partners, both of which are SMEs from France, namely AKIRA and 2E WINDINGS, which will work together with Liebherr. In addition to the project’s concept, Liebherr has also made plans to manufacture these new devices on a new, fully automated and fully connected production line at its facility in Toulouse. From design to production, the life cycle of this new product will form a practical example of how the processes and tools that form part of the digital transformation can be applied. The project will take just over three years to complete.As announced by Bruno Le Maire during his visit, the second project will also receive support under the relaunch plan. That project will focus on the development of high-speed air compressors that incorporate a unique type of technology involving the use of air bearings. The compressors will be used in the rail transport sector to provide propulsion powered by fuel cells. This project represents an overall investment of around € 4.9 million and will be co-funded by the state to the tune of € 1.25 million. The product itself will generate zero CO2 emissions and provide an alternative for a new generation of trains. The project will be developed in collaboration with partners based in France (two partner SMEs, namely 2E WINDINGS and Danielson Engineering) and a sub-contracting firm (Centum Adeneo). As a result of the project, Liebherr-Aerospace will be able to offer innovative solutions developed from within the aerospace sector itself, while continuing its efforts to diversify its activities targeted at the rail sectorAs Francis Carla, Managing Director and Chief Technology Officer, Liebherr-Aerospace & Transportation SAS, explained:“The relaunch plan will enable us to withstand the crisis, to preserve as many skills and jobs as we can and, as our projects themselves specifically illustrate, to get our company ready for the “post crisis” era; the plan will also allow us to fast-track our progress along our technology road map as we endeavour to develop products that are more environmentally friendly. Along with all industrial players in the aeronautics sector, we have taken up the challenge of developing “greener” aircraft as a means of ensuring that a carbon-neutral air transport sector becomes a reality.”.

It brings to ten the number of Liebherr STS at the port since the first STS was handed over in 2018.The cranes are identical to the previous supplied and are amongst the largest STS cranes in the world with an outreach of 73 m, a span of 30.48 m and a backreach of 25 m. The cranes have a safe working load of 75 tonnes and are able to handle the world’s largest container vessels. Designed to work vessels with 25 containers across and up to 10 high on deck, the cranes will allow NTB to handle future generations of ultra large container vessels.As well as being amongst the largest, the cranes are also some of the most advanced. Liebherr Automation Systems facilitates semi-automatic moves, with manual intervention only required when operating below a predefined safe height. The port operates straddle carriers on the landside and the cranes are equipped with a yard monitoring system, which scans the operational area for obstacles, hazards or straddle carriers, and will allow placement of the container at the target position only when it is safe to do so.. Innovative straddle carrier lane covers open only over the active lane, providing protection for those on the ground. Stack and vessel anti-collision, in addition to a vessel drift compensation system, provides safety when operating. Crane to crane, and crane to ship, laser anti-collision systems provide further safety when the crane is travelling or booming down.Speaking about the cranes Christian Lankenau, Managing Director NTB commented, “We are pleased to add four new Liebherr ship to shore container cranes to our fleet. These new cranes and the previous six allow us to provide exceptional service to our customers. We have invested in these large state-of-the-art cranes, not only for the present, but also for the future and they are a key part of our growth and expansion plans.For NTB it was very straightforward to invest in Liebherr cranes again.

"In case of imminent accident, new brake assistant for Liebherr wheel loaders reduces stopping distance",Press releases |01/19/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/in-case-of-imminent-accident-new-brake-assistant-for-liebherr-wheel-loaders-reduces-stopping-distance.html?page=77,Active personnel detection is an innovative assistance system for the Liebherr L 526 to L 586 XPower® range of wheel loaders. Liebherr has now added two extra functions - the brake assistant and incident map - to active personnel detection. The brake assistant automatically slows the speed of the wheel loader to a standstill the moment the active personnel detection issues a warning signal. The incident map displays potential risk zones on the site using GPS data in LiDAT - Liebherr’s in-house transfer and location system.Find out more,Press releases,01/19/2021,"Statistically speaking, accidents with wheel loaders occur most frequently when the machine operator reverses after a loading process. This reverse travel is particularly risky if people are located in the wheel loader’s operating area. In these situations, there is a huge responsibility on the machine operator. Construction machine accidents can often result in severe injuries and significant damage. To ensure maximum safety, Liebherr is therefore continuing to develop its assistance systems. A current example of this is active personnel detection at the rear which now has an integrated braking assistance function and an incident map.. Brake assistant: automatic speed reduction reduces stopping distanceActive personnel detection visually alerts the machine operator via the display screen and sounds acoustic signals if there is danger in the wheel loader’s rear area. In order to provide a specific warning of imminent injury to people, the assistance system, using smart sensors, provides specific warning of people in the rear area of the wheel loader at a greater distance than for obstructions such as walls, columns or other vehicles. This means the assistance system avoids unnecessary signals, thereby reducing the burden on the machine operator and causing fewer distractions.The moment the active personnel detection system identifies a source of danger, the brake assistant slows the wheel loader down to a standstill. The braking process is therefore initiated at an earlier stage and quicker than in the case of traditional braking since, with the brake assistant, there is no delay caused by human reaction time. This means there is an important reduction in the stopping distance which, in turn, reduces the frequency and severity of accidents.In the case of the brake assistant, the hydrostatic components of the drive train automatically reduce the speed. This means the machine operator can continue to operate the wheel loader service brake in the normal way and can do this in addition to the brake assistant.. Incident map: risk management thanks to display of danger zonesBesides the brake assistant, a second new function for the active personnel detection at the rear is the incident map. Each time the assistance system detects a danger and a warning signal is issued, the system transmits a GPS signal to LiDAT, Liebherr’s in-house transfer and location system. On the basis of this signal, and for each operator of a wheel loader with active personnel detection, Liebherr provides a Google map in LiDAT showing these GPS points.The result is an incident map displaying the risk zones and potential sources of danger on the site. The operator can use this to take measures to prevent accidents and therefore increase safety. For example, the operator might reroute footpaths, cordon off areas and alter dangerous work sequences. The head of operations can use the incident map to train employees and make them aware of risky situations.. Additional intelligent wheel loader assistance systems for increased safetyLiebherr offers several intelligent assistance systems for its mid-range and large wheel loader series. In addition to active personnel detection, these include adaptive working lighting, front space monitoring, the skyview 360° camera system, the tyre pressure monitoring system with sensor support and the new weighing device. Liebherr’s goal with the assistance systems is to increase safety and comfort and to support the machine operator. All systems have been developed by Liebherr and are therefore fully integrated in the machine control.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

"From +5 to -86 degrees: Liebherr appliances ensure safe storage of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and research materials",Press releases |01/18/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/from-5-to-86-degrees-liebherr-appliances-ensure-safe-storage-of-vaccines-pharmaceuticals-and-research-materials.html?page=77,"Our hopes rest on a number of new vaccines to carry us through the corona pandemic. To ensure safe storage of the sensitive vaccines, pharmaceuticals and research materials high-performance fridges and freezers are essential. LiebherrAppliances offers the full product range for refrigeration. Pharmacy fridges provide refrigeration at +5 degrees, laboratory refrigerators at -20 degrees and ultra lowtemperature freezers at down to -86 degrees Celsius.Find out more",Press releases,01/18/2021,"For many years Liebherr-Appliances has also been developing and producing appliances for the Scientific & Health Care sector. The specific challenge in this case is the proper and long-term storage of temperature-sensitive materials. Vaccines in particular rapidly become unusable if not stored under the perfect conditions. Vaccine storage requires a reduction in cell activity and this, in turn, requires certain temperatures. All Liebherr appliances are able to fully document that the temperatures required for each vaccine have been reliably maintained. Features including integrated safety systems such as optical and audible alarms and extensive interfaces for forwarding alarms also ensure the safety of the valuable goods being stored.Liebherr-Appliances has now added the new ultra-low temperature freezers (ULTs) to this product range – these currently represent a highly important product segment. The refrigeration specialist therefore now offers a full spectrum for optimum storage of a wide variety of application groups from +5 degrees Celsius to -86 degrees Celsius. This ensures the quality of the goods stored over months or even years.. Pharmacy fridges: as versatile as they are preciseThe product range includes pharmacy fridges. In pharmacies, doctors' surgeries and hospitals, these appliances offer the professional solution for the safe storage of temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals needing refrigeration at temperatures between +2 degrees Celsius and +8 degrees Celsius. Liebherr has been producing pharmacy fridges for more than ten years, with extensive experience in this sector. A wide variety of specimens, samples and sensitive pharmaceuticals can be stored in the refrigerators. Precision electronic controllers combined with highly effective insulation, the optimised dynamic cooling system and the careful processing ensures that safety is maintained. The appliances comply with the DIN standard 58345 for the storage of pharmacy products.The product range offers the right solution for every requirement. The pharmacy fridges are available in four basic models - each with a solid door or glass door. The glass door provides a particular advantage. It gives you an overview before you even open it, which means the door only needs to be opened for a short time. This ensures that precise regulation with an extremely flat temperature curve is not interrupted.Laboratory refrigerators: maximum safety for highly sensitive substancesLaboratories are also dependent on the reliable storage of sensitive substances. For twelve years now Liebherr has been offering specialised laboratory refrigerators allowing highly sensitive or even flammable substances to be stored safely. Innovative cooling technologies and smart functions ensure optimum storage conditions at constant temperatures. The targeted airflow in the appliance distributes the cold air evenly and maintains a constant temperature. In the event of deviations, a visual and acoustic warning system alerts the user in good time so that no damage can occur. The optionally expandable SmartMonitoring provides even more precise control and therefore maximum safety during storage. The laboratory refrigerators can also be integrated into existing monitoring solutions, thus helping to maintain the cold chain.The range of laboratory refrigerators includes models for every purpose. The large-volume appliances with stainless steel interior containers are particularly suitable for the long-term storage of large amounts of sensitive substances. The compact appliances with plastic interior containers are ideal where space is limited. The models with ATEX-compliant interiors offer reliable safety for highly flammable and explosive substances.. Ultra low-temperature freezers: the new specialists - sustainable and efficientLiebherr's new ultra-low temperature freezers are specifically designed for extreme storage temperatures from -40 to -86 degrees Celsius. They are used in particular for short and longterm, ultra-low temperature storage of sensitive samples such as DNA, viruses or proteins and vaccines including some of the new mRNA vaccines.In order to achieve temperatures as low as -86 degrees Celsius, a special cooling system is needed which differs from that in normal refrigerators. In its ultra-low temperature refrigerators, Liebherr uses currently the most energy-efficient cooling system. This is cascade cooling with two refrigeration circuits and environmentally friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants. The appliances are therefore highly energy efficient and sustainable.For more information: https://home.liebherr.com/en/gbr/products/commercialappliances/research-and-laboratories/cooling-of-vaccines/cooling-of-vaccines.html.

Digitalization in deep foundation work: The positioning system LIPOS ® supports continuous flight auger drilling ,Press releases |01/18/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/digitalization-in-deep-foundation-work-the-positioning-system-lipos-supports-continuous-flight-auger-drilling.html?page=77,"Every building stands on a solid foundation that bears the whole weight. However, when the ground below is too soft or unstable, qualified deep foundation specialists come into play in order to provide the required ground bearing capacity. With the LIPOS system, Liebherr equips the deep foundation specialists with a tool that simplifies the task in various ways.Find out more",Press releases,01/18/2021,"The Burgenland Hospital Association, KRAGES, is building a general hospital in Oberwart, Austria. The new building, in direct vicinity to the existing hospital, shall guarantee excellent medical, nursing and therapeutic care in the region. In order to avoid subsequent settlement and damage to the new building, the available land requires substantial foundation work before it can support a whole hospital.. Züblin Spezialtiefbau Ges.m.b.H. equips its first Liebherr drilling rig for the digital ageThe company Züblin Spezialtiefbau Ges.m.b.H. was contracted to install 1,310 piles in an area of 23.000 m² for the foundation of the complete new building. All piles have a diameter of 630 mm and are being installed using the CFA (continuous flight auger) method. The maximum depth of the foundation piles is 16 m. Initially, it was assumed that a construction period of approximately 4 months would be required to complete more than 1000 piles. To complete the task, Züblin Spezialtiefbau is using a Liebherr drilling rig type LB 28, which has been equipped with the positioning system LIPOS for the first time. The LB 28 is supported on site by a Liebherr concrete pump type THS 110, which ensures that the delivered concrete is immediately pumped to the required location.. All drilling points can be quickly selected and the machine positionedOnce the complete building ground was exactly measured and the precise position of each single pile was identified, the gathered data could be transferred as a digital drilling plan to the LIPOS positioning system in the Liebherr machine in no time. Jobsite data and pile lists for work to be carried out are transferred to the machine when the drilling list is uploaded. The operator sees his position with centimetre precision at all times thanks to an additional monitor in the cabin. The LB 28 can be manoeuvred with ease to each of the 1,310 drilling points without the need of any iron stakes or colour markings for orientation. The operator no longer has to watch out for ground markings or the concrete hose. He can concentrate on important things, is more flexible and independent, and therefore, quicker in handling the drilling rig. Furthermore, the system simplifies the positioning of jobsite equipment. The concrete pump, the reinforcements, as well as other tools and material can be optimally positioned around the drilling rig.. Productivity results from the combination of high performance machine technology and sophisticated assistance systemsAn above-average daily drilling performance is achieved using the LB 28 and the construction work could be completed earlier than planned, actually after only 3 months. One reason, in addition to the reliable Liebherr construction machine, is the extremely productive working method. The LIPOS positioning system plays a decisive role here. Without this system the drilling points would have to be newly measured, drawn and marked at least three times a day. An enormous additional effort which is completely eliminated with the help of LIPOS. All jobsite personnel has a clear overview at all times of exactly where the piles are, which piles are already completed and which still have to be done. One thing is clear for the site manager Harald Fugger following his experience on the jobsite in Oberwart, “The LIPOS positioning system is ideally suited for completing jobsites, especially using the CFA method. It has proven itself well on the jobsite and makes working processes easier allowing continuous real time control and monitoring. Quality management is considerably improved through the automatic recording of the processes. The LIPOS system is basically self-explanatory for the operator and convinces through easy handling.”.

Largest Liebherr material handling machine in France delivered ,Press releases |01/15/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/largest-liebherr-material-handling-machine-in-france-delivered.html?page=77,"The largest Liebherr material handling machine to be delivered in France to date, an LH 110 M Port Litronic, will be operated at the harbour of Villefranche-sur-Saône in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, near Lyon. The harbour is located directly on the wide-gauge axis of the Rhône-Saône rivers, acting as a trimodal location linking waterways, road and rail carriers across the whole of France.Find out more",Press releases,01/15/2021,"Florent Dupré, Managing Director of the Harbour of Villefranche-sur-Saône, was looking for a high-quality, reliable machine that would be able to deliver good handling performance. Furthermore, it should also offer great flexibility to meet a wide range of different operational requirements in the harbour.The company, which has maintained a commercial relationship with Liebherr since 2002, selected the LH 110 M Port, a new material handling machine with an operational weight of around 110 tons from the Port Equipment product line. Besides the high level of product quality, Florent Dupré was impressed by the openness and competence of the local Liebherr representative, Tecmat Service.The machine: LH 110 M Port Litronic The new Liebherr LH 110 M Port material handling machine was designed especially for handling bulk goods and general cargo in port handling operations. It impresses with its new weight-optimized equipment and enormous lift capacities. At the same time, the 13 metre angled boom and the 12 metre straight stick give the machine a reach of up to 23.8 metres, allowing it to cover an extensive working area when loading and unloading ships. Outrigger support on the front and rear mobile undercarriage and optimised weight distribution between the uppercarriage, undercarriage and equipment provide for maximum stability in working operation and contribute to an above-average handling capacity.The LH 110 M Port at the harbour in Villefranche-sur-Saône is presented as a powerful and efficient machine. The equipment includes the standard, innovative Liebherr energy recovery (ERC) system. This boosts the system performance, providing for greater handling capacity and at the same time allowing energy savings of up to 30%. The 300 kW / 408 hp, Stage V emissions compliant Liebherr construction machinery diesel engine allows the material handling machine to mobilise a total output of 478 kW in combination with the ERC system.. Top-class cab: maximum operating comfort Another highlight of the LH 110 M Port is the freely variable height-adjustable double-parallelogram hydraulic driver's cab with sliding door. Its large window areas give the operator in the harbour optimum view upwards, forwards and downwards. The double-parallelogram cab can be moved forward up to 4 metres for an even better view to the front, for example over a ship's side. Moreover, it also offers the operator safe and simple access from the ground. The ergonomic driver's seat, the intuitive colour touchscreen display and the standard proportional controls and joystick steering all contribute to comfortable operation and precise control of the Liebherr material handler.Liebherr attachments and quick coupling systems: for economical handling in the harbour Every day, a wide range of different materials are handled at the harbour in Villefranche-sur-Saône. This amounts to up to 1,850,000 tons of bulk and conventional goods every year. The company's product portfolio includes a broad range of logistics solutions in the field of heavy load handling, plus warehouse and outdoor storage capacity. In order to respond flexibly to specific operational requirements, Florent Dupré chose the attachments specially developed and produced by Liebherr for harbour handling. The equipment of the LH 110 M Port now includes the Liebherr clamshell and the Liebherr wood grapple, each in two different sizes. The two Liebherr clamshells, the GMZ 80 and GMZ 120, can be used for the safe and fast handling of bulk goods such as ore, coal, sand, gravel and grain. The filling volume of the Liebherr clamshell GMZ 80 is 6 m³; that of the GMZ 120 around 8 m³. The special Liebherr wood grapples are used for the safe handling of all kinds of wood and timber. The Liebherr wood grapple GMH 80 can pick up and handle up to 1.9 m² of wood. The Liebherr wood grapple GMH 120 can manage up to 3.6 m². To enable the attachments to be changed quickly and safely for different operations from the driver's cab, the LH 110 M Port is now equipped with the MH 110B LIKUFIX quick coupling system. This is a fully automatic coupling system for suspended attachments, for example Liebherr clamshells and wood grapples. Florent Dupré is convinced: ""The combination of Liebherr attachments specially designed for the intended operation, and the fully automatic Liebherr quick coupling system will allow maximum machine utilisation of the LH 110 M Port and thus greater handling capacity at our harbour in Villefranche-sur-Saône.""Ceremonial handover of the keysThe official handover of the LH 110 M Port took place at the harbour in Villefranche-sur-Saône at the end of 2020. During the ceremony, Martin Schickel (managing director of Liebherr-France SAS) and Franck Lafabrie (managing director of Tecmat Service) presented a symbolic key to the new Liebherr material handling machine to the harbour manager, Florent Dupré..

New alternative – fast telescoping using rope pull technology for Liebherr LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane ,Press releases |01/14/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-alternative-%E2%80%93-fast-telescoping-using-rope-pull-technology-for-liebherr-ltc-1050-3-1-compact-crane.html?page=77,Liebherr has developed another option for its successful LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane – in future crane contractors will have the choice between the existing 36 metre telescopic boom with the TELEMATIK fast cycle telescoping system and a new 31 metre boom featuring rope extension technology. The first machines with the new telescopic boom will be delivered in the second half of 2021.Find out more,Press releases,01/14/2021,"The development of the TELEMATIK single-cylinder fast cycle telescoping system at the end of the 90s not only won Liebherr a series of innovation awards, but also revolutionised the crane market. TELEMATIK provided the basis for the development of multi-section and therefore ever longer telescopic booms with increased performance. The system operates using just one hydraulic cylinder and an internal locking system for the individual telescoping sections. The telescoping sections are extended easily and automatically to the required lengths using the hydraulic cylinder and are then pinned.. Lightweight single-cylinder extension system: powerful and longThis lightweight single-cylinder extension system delivers high lifting capacities with long booms and large radii. But even with the booms not fully extended, TELEMATIK delivers higher lifting capacities as the individual telescoping sections can be extended in any sequence and independently of each other.As a result of its many benefits, Liebherr used TELEMATIK on the LTC 1045-3.1, which was launched in 2010, and its successor, the LTC 1050-3.1, which replaced it as from 2015.. Boom with rope extension mechanism - familiar and fastCrane contractors who chiefly use the Liebherr compact crane inside buildings and mostly do not need the full length of the 36 metre telescopic boom see also benefits of a boom with rope pull technology – the telescoping process is faster and many operators of mobile cranes in the lifting capacity class up to 50 tonnes are familiar with rope pull technology.Liebherr uses a hydro-mechanical telescoping system on LTM mobile cranes whose telescopic boom consists of the pivot section and a maximum of three telescoping sections. The integral rope pull technology enables the telescopic boom to be extended to the required length particularly easily and quickly.After in-depth discussions with customers, Liebherr decided to develop a boom with a rope extension mechanism as an alternative for the LTC 1050-3.1. This is 31 metres long and consists of a pivot section and 4 telescoping sections – one less than the TELEMATIK boom. The telescoping sections are extended and retracted using a dual-action 2-stage hydraulic cylinder. Stage 1 extends telescoping section 1. Stage 2 extends telescoping sections 2 to 4 synchronously using a 2-way pulley block. The new boom also delivers high telescoping lifting capacities, an important feature for use inside buildings..

World class – Team Liebherr plays at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium,Press releases |01/12/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/world-class-team-liebherr-plays-at-the-santiago-bernabeu-stadium.html?page=77,"Legendary football stadium Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid is currently being refurbished. It will reopen in 2022 in the form of a superb, ultra-modern stadium with a wide range of positive features. The professionals at Spanish championship record holders Real Madrid CF have therefore had to leave the pitch – to be replaced by a whole team of cranes and construction machinery, playing a fascinating game, featuring an LR 1800-1.0 from Eurogruas 2000 together with an LR 1600/2 and an LR 1600/2-W from Gruas Aguilar.Find out more",Press releases,01/12/2021,"Established crane contractor Gruas Aguilar has, at times, had 18 Liebherr mobile and crawler cranes on the site with lifting capacities ranging from 40 to 1200 tonnes. “Winning the order for the crane work at the Bernabéu was not only a routine job for us, but also a great challenge”, says Luis Aguilar, owner of Gruas Aguilar. “The logistics and planning required for all these cranes in all different sizes was enormous. From the compact LTC 1050-3.1 and LRT 1100-2.1 rough-terrain crane to the LTM 11200-9.1, there was a full team on the pitch”, adds Aguilar and continues: “Obviously, we were reliant on the usual competent, fast response from Liebherr-Iberica’s after-sales service team.”. The champions – LR 1800-1.0, LR 1600/2 and LR 1600/2-WThe three-man formation consisting of an LR 1600/2 and an LR 1600/2-W from Gruas Aguilar, together with an LR 1800-1.0 from Eurogruas 2000, produced a strong performance. They were on site permanently from June to December 2020 carrying out a wide variety of hoisting work. The gigantic heavy girders for the roof structure, in particular, had to be hoisted into position.. The LR 1800-1.0 from Eurogruas 2000 impressed as a skilful playmaker. It was demonstrating all its strengths, as Javier Sato, co-owner of the Eurogruas 2000 Group explains: “High capacity, compact dimensions, low-cost logistics and flexible use – they were the features that resulted in us investing in the LR 1800-1.0. It was a very good decision for us and we are proud to have taken delivery of the very first machine at the Bauma in 2019.” The working conditions in the centre of the city immediately next to the arterial Paseo de la Castellana road were very complex due to the highly constricted space available, heavy loads and large radii. “We were completely reliant on the flexibility of the derrick ballast”, says Eurogruas 2000’s Project Manager, Jose Garcia and Juan Ayora. “The V-Frame enabled us to position loads weighing between 40 and 213 tonnes with a very wide range of radii safely and precisely without having to move the crane on the site.” The experienced crane contractor simulated every hoist in detail on a computer beforehand with the site team. Garcia and Ayora continue: “The teams from Liebherr-Iberica and Liebherr in Ehingen meant we had excellent, successful teamwork, particularly configuring the booms and planning the hoists.”. The new star among stadiumsThe Bernabéu Stadium, one of the real landmarks of Madrid, has a long history. For Santiago Bernabéu, who was initially a player before he became coach and then President of Real Madrid, the stadium represented the achievement of a lifelong dream. He collected donations and was able to start the construction work in 1944, during the Second World War. The stadium was then opened in 1947. After several modifications and extensions over the past few decades, the stadium, which has hosted a whole series of international finals, is currently once again filled with construction machines.By 2022, the Bernabéu will be an ultramodern stadium with a hydraulically adjustable roof structure, lowering hybrid turf and new shopping, business and leisure facilities. The façade can be illuminated during the hours of darkness using LEDs in a wide range of scenarios. There is a promenade around the entire structure at the top of the façade which provides a panoramic view of life in the neighbouring streets and the sporting excellence or events taking place in the stadium itself..

Wagstaff chooses 900 ton Liebherr LTM 1750-9.1 with new software upgrade for critical lift ,Press releases |01/11/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/wagstaff-chooses-900-ton-liebherr-ltm-1750-9.1-with-new-software-upgrade-for-critical-lift.html?page=77,A Liebherr LTM 1750-9.1 with a new crane software upgrade kit provided the lifting power for Wagstaff Crane Service during an expansion project at the Hunstman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah.Find out more,Press releases,01/11/2021,"Wagstaff Crane Service based out of Murray, Utah, provided services for installation of a 175 ft., 125,000 pound sky bridge at the new Kathryn F. Kirk Center for Comprehensive Cancer Care and Women’s Cancers at Huntsman Cancer hospital.Wagstaff Crane Service was subcontracted to unload, assemble and place a steel pedestrian bridge in its final position on the north side campus expansion. The pedestrian bridge is part of a multi-phase expansion project and ties into the Phase III expansion started in 2011. Due to the location of the bridge and how it integrates into the multi-phase expansion, the bridge needed to be placed prior to the start of any of the Phase V structure, slated to begin construction in 2022.Presented with the unique challenge of working near a congested area of the hospital with heavy traffic on the side of a mountain, Wagstaff Crane Service employed its flagship crane, the LTM 1750-9.1 with the recent crane software upgrade. The improved load charts made this lift possible, without the upgrade the lift would have been over 90% of the total capacity. The Wagstaff project management team considered a crawler crane as the alternative but it proved to be more costly for all parties involved.“We were planning for this lift about a year before this took place. Numerous different configurations had been drawn up including a proposal with plans showing a critical lift at 93%. The option to bring in a large crawler crane was also considered due to the fact that the lift was taking place over a functioning hospital clinic with close proximity to power lines, and active life flight helicopters. These risks coupled with a critical lift made some nervous to proceed, until the update was released, and we could present a new and improved lift plan that showed a safer lift,” said Ronnie Wagstaff, Project Manager for Wagstaff Crane Service.The LTM 1750-9.1 is a popular option among customers because it is easy to transport, can fit in tight spaces, sets up quickly, has high lifting capacity and a variable boom system. “The LTM 1750-9.1 was able to drive to the site with equipment installed with only an additional 11 truckloads of parts needed. The crane was assembled and ready to work in approximately 12 hours,” said Wagstaff.“A combination of limited site space, constrained site access, fully open facilities adjacent to and below portions of the bridge, weight and distance of the pick, as well as the need for several different configurations for the offloading and ground pre-assembly of the bridge at close radius to the crane and setting of the support steel on the north east side of the Phase 3 building, were all determining factors in the use of the LTM 1750 for this project,” Wagstaff continued.. LTM 1750-9.1 with new software upgradeAn already impressive 900 ton, nine axle, 18 wheel all-terrain crane- the LTM 1750-9.1, is even more powerful with the newest crane upgrade kit and can hoist even heavier loads. The use of refined static calculation methods enables increased lifting capacity values across the entire working range. Owners of the LTM 1750-9.1 can now update the crane software with the new tables and, if necessary, add any additional equipment required.This latest software upgrade, provides additional value due to the improved load charts. Lifting capacity tables for three wind speeds are now available for this crane and for all the latest new developments. The LTM 1750-9.1 has entered into a higher lifting capacity class due to the new luffing jib configuration used for wind power applications. This delivers significant additional support for customers, both during job planning and in operation. It takes a critical lift and brings it within requirements of the job specifications. During this project “several lifts that were critical – 90% or above, were reduced to 85% or lower,” said Project Manager, Ronnie Wagstaff.. DownloadsDownload the press release and images here..

Order for 33 G-BKF armoured recovery and crane vehicles for the Bundeswehr completed,Press releases |01/11/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/order-for-33-g-bkf-armoured-recovery-and-crane-vehicles-for-the-bundeswehr-completed.html?page=77,"In June 2017, Liebherr received an order from the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) to deliver a total of 71 armoured mobile and recovery cranes worth around 150 million euros. The final two of the total of 33 type G-BKF armoured recovery cranes left the Liebherr plant in Ehingen on 10 December. The majority of the total of 38 type G-LTM armoured mobile cranes have also been delivered. The final six machines are scheduled for delivery in 2021.Find out more",Press releases,01/11/2021,"Under the contract, all 33 G-BKF recovery cranes should have been delivered by 15 November. However, when the original schedule was drawn up, nobody had even heard of Covid-19. As a result of the “force majeure” caused by the pandemic and the subsequent difficulties Liebherr experienced in production, the company requested an extension of four weeks in the delivery deadline from the BAAINBw. This was approved so that the final recovery cranes were delivered to the Bundeswehr’s material depot in Karlsruhe on schedule on 10 December.G-BKF recovery craneThe G-BKF from Liebherr is an armoured recovery crane on a standard four-axle mobile crane chassis. It has excellent off-road capability and great manoeuvrability. Its two recovery winches and a towing hitch at the rear enable it to rescue and tow a wide range of different vehicles such as the new generation of armoured control and command vehicles (GFF), armoured transport vehicles (GTF), MULTI FSA (swap body vehicles) and wheeled vehicles which are already in use whilst the operating personnel is being guarded. The G-BKF can be used flexibly and economically since it is equipped both to recover vehicles and to hoist loads. Its 20.9 metre telescopic boom enables the G-BKF to handle loads weighing up to 20 tonnes quickly and precisely.. Exemplary collaborationLiebherr developed the armoured G-BKF recovery crane on the basis of the Bundeswehr’s specifications and the first prototype underwent intensive testing over a period of several months. This was followed by additional extensive tests by the Bundeswehr before the order was placed. The tests continued in rugged conditions even after the delivery of the first machines. The collaboration between Liebherr and the customer was very close throughout this period and was rated as exemplary by both sides.Brigadier General André Denk, Commander of the Bundeswehr Logistics School, praised the project in a discussion with Dr Peter Tauber, State Secretary of the Federal Minister for Defence: “This vehicle is a prime example of what can be achieved by collaboration between the Bundeswehr, BAAIN and industry.” The Bundeswehr website contains the following: “The armoured recovery/crane vehicle takes into account the fact that the Bundeswehr fleet has become ever heavier and maintains its ability to recover and tow vehicles in the future.”Interactive electronic technical documentation (IETD) on a tablet was part of the order and was extremely important to the Bundeswehr. The IETD contains all the relevant information for the Bundeswehr to operate, maintain and, up to a certain level, repair the vehicles safely and on the basis of the manufacturer’s specifications. Although the specifications for preparing the IETD (under Directives S1000D™ and S2000M), which originated in the aviation industry, were completely new to Liebherr in Ehingen, they were implemented to the complete satisfaction of the customer. The Bundeswehr’s quality requirements for the vehicles and the documentation for them were reviewed on a regular basis by a Bundeswehr quality inspector and by the Bundeswehr itself in practice..

12 crawler excavators for HM-Entreprenør A/S,Press releases |01/07/2021,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/12-crawler-excavators-for-hm-entreprenor-a-s.html?page=78,"The Danish company HM-Entreprenør is based just 1.5 km from the headquarters of the JMM Group, Liebherr’s Danish distributor. In 2017, HM-Entreprenør ordered 12 machines from Generation 6. Following the Bauma construction industry trade fair in 2019 in Munich, the company acquired 12 new Liebherr crawler excavators to replace Generation 6 excavators, and in early 2021 more excavators will be delivered.Find out more",Press releases,01/07/2021,"HM-Entreprenør is convinced more than ever by the quality and performance of our machines. Company manager Leif Ejlertzen needs to replace machines and “this time it will be Liebherr”. The company currently operates nine R 926s, three R 945s, to be joined by two new R 914 Compacts in early 2021. The machines are from the Generation 8 of crawler excavators, presented at Bauma 2019 in Munich. It was there that Leif Rudebeck Petersen of the JMM Group and Michael Mortensen of HM-Entreprenør closed the deal. The proximity of the two companies is very convenient for the delivery, but this was not the only criterion taken into account in the decision: service, quality and the competent people also played major roles. Johs. Møllers Machines A/S has over 75 years of experience and now covers all of the the Danish market.. Impressive performance of Generation 8 excavatorsLeif Ejlertzen, coordinator of the construction company, is impressed by the performance of the latest generation of excavators. He was pleasantly surprised by the Generation 6 excavators in 2017, but the improvements made mean the performance of the Generation 8 machines is “even more impressive”. Liebherr excavators will be used in the Danish company’s biggest project: the construction of a 240,000 m² logistics centre. Large quantities of earth must be shifted in this project, so the power of the Generation 8 excavators is a great asset for this site. Machine reliability is also important, because every machine stoppage represents huge cost to the business.Generation 8 crawler excavators are equipped towards the future. Engine power is increased, the counterweight is heavier and the bucket capacities are higher. The overall performance is therefore much greater.. “The best service”The Danish company works with the local dealer Johs. Møllers Machines. HM-Entreprenør has a full service contract for all of its machines. Leif Ejlertzen is familiar with the level of service of the competitors, and according to him “none of them compares to the JMM Group”. The Service is very important, the machines are all operating at the same time, so the company needs to be sure that no problems will slow down the project. In addition, maintenance is easier and safer on the new Generation 8 models. All service points are accessible from ground level.

The decision to purchase their latest order of cranes was based on Liebherr’s reputation as a leader in the industry.“We chose Liebherr due to the reliability of their equipment, life span of the equipment and quality customer service,” said Berry Peterson, Vice President of equipment service for Bay Ltd.“The crane techs at Bay rely heavily on the detailed training Liebherr is able to provide. That combined with the service department and parts availability gives them a head up when Bay is looking to source additional cranes for the fleet,” said Peterson. “No other crane manufacturer has provided Bay Ltd. with the quality we get from the Liebherr product. It is because of the support and response Bay receives from Liebherr that we ordered an additional 15 All Terrain units. We are proud to say that we will have 60 Liebherr cranes in our fleet.”. Ten years ago, Bay LTD became more familiar with hydraulic mobile cranes built in Europe. The company recognized a need for a more mobile type of hydraulic crane to provide customers a better option when making lifts on their job site. This led to the company’s initial purchase of 15Liebherr cranes including a LTM 1400-7.1 in 2012. The LTM 1400-7.1 became the catalyst that led Bay LTD to become the heavy lifting and hauling company they are today. “It was by far the largest hydraulic crane in our fleet and helped pave the way to many more large AT cranes,” said Peterson.As one of the largest full-service multi-discipline construction, fabrication and maintenance contractors in the United States, Bay Ltd has pooled the diverse talents of each team member to offer clients real solutions for the most challenging construction projects.Based out of Corpus Christi, Texas and operating in five states Bay Ltd prides itself on being one of the most trusted names in the business..

LR 11000 from Felbermayr unloads 450 tonne generator from barge ,Press releases |12/16/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/lr-11000-from-felbermayr-unloads-450-tonne-generator-from-barge.html?page=78,"Austrian crane and heavy haulage contractor Felbermayr hoisted a 450 tonne generator off a barge in Herne using its Liebherr LR 11000 crawler crane. The 1000 tonne crane then placed the massive load on SPMTs (self-propelled modular transporters), which transported the generator to the extension of a nearby power plant.Find out more",Press releases,12/16/2020,"Felbermayr transported its brand new LR 11000 to tackle its first job using around 19 low loaders and 30 curtain-sider trailers to Herne, a city in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region in North Rhine-Westphalia, and set it up on the Rhine-Herne Canal. The 45 kilometre canal, built the start of the 19th century, is an important waterway for a number of industrial sites in the Ruhr Region.. The challenge facing the Liebherr crawler crane was to unload a 450 tonne generator from a barge, which had collected the unit from Mülheim an der Ruhr. This massive component was destined for the expansion of a gas and steam turbine power plant which is just 2 km away from where the barge had tied up. The generator was then transported on to self-propelled transport units with 18 axles each to its later operating location, were it was unloaded by the power plant crane.. The LR 11000 was set up with a 42 metre main boom, a derrick boom, 260 tonnes of slewing platform ballast and a suspended ballast pallet for the heavyweight hoist. 320 tonnes of suspended ballast were added by an auxiliary crane after the generator had been attached.To hoist the generator out of the vessel and place it on the SPMTs, the LR 11000 was able to use all its strengths as the crane had to reverse around 20 metres with the full load on the hook so that the two linked SMPTs were able to move in front of the crane. The crane winches then very carefully deposited the valuable load on the self-propelled units.. This crane job once again demonstrated a feature which is far from rare in crawler crane jobs – setting up and dismantling the crane takes several days, but the actual hoisting work can be completed quickly. Immediately after the barge had tied up in the port at 12 noon, the load was attached and by 2.30 pm it had been placed on the SPMTs, meaning that the LR 11000 had finished its work..

The machine operated by Zaugg AG Rohrbach based in the Canton of Berne was one of the first of its kind to be delivered to customers. Zaugg uses the new mobile crane for a range of tasks including erecting construction cranes thanks to its 60 metre telescopic boom.Find out more",Press releases,12/10/2020,"A few months ago, the fleet of Swiss contractor Zaugg AG Rohrbach received an addition – a Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 mobile crane. “We use the new crane for all sorts of jobs”, says Christian Geissmann, Crane Logistics Manager at Zaugg. “From moving large oil tanks and machine relocations to structural steelwork, the LTM 1110-5.1 does almost everything we need. We even use the crane to erect small construction cranes. It really is an all-rounder.”. “VarioBase® is something else.”During the crane job at the concrete plant, crane driver Christian Kaufmann was on a construction site with the LTM 1110-5.1 for the first time. Normally the young crane operator is in charge of a crane from another manufacturer. To complete the hoists at the dry concrete production plant, Kaufmann had to position the new crane right by the side of the road. However, there was not enough space available to set up his crane with the outriggers fully extended. He therefore extended the outriggers to 56 and 62 percent against the traffic. This was the only way he could operate with the supports fully extended on the load side. “My other three year old crane also has a variable support base, but it is restricted to the defined pinning positions. VarioBase® is something else.”. Tower crane assembly in confined spacesAt 60 metres in length, the Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 has one of the longest telescopic booms of any mobile crane in its lifting class. The powerful and agile 5-axle crane is virtually predestined for the assembly of smaller tower cranes. Thanks to its compact dimensions and features such as VarioBase®, the mobile crane is also perfectly suited for work in narrow city centres. The new LTM 1110-5.1 from Zaugg has already been able to demonstrate its strengths in a narrow alley in the old town of Solothurn, Switzerland, when dismantling a Liebherr tower crane.Zaugg AG Rohrbach was originally founded in 1936 as a small family-run business, with the third generation now at the helm. It has a workforce of over 130 people working in construction, joinery and carpentry, in its crane logistics, heavy and special haulage divisions and also in industrial relocation services. In addition to forklift trucks and lifting platforms, Zaugg has a fleet of 16 mobile and mobile construction cranes.

New alternative – using SPMTs as ballast trailers for Liebherr LR 11000 crawler crane,Press releases |12/09/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/new-alternative-using-spmts-as-ballast-trailers-for-liebherr-lr-11000-crawler-crane.html?page=79,"Liebherr has developed an interesting alternative for the derrick ballast of crawler cranes, working closely with global crane and heavy haulage contractor Sarens and heavy haulage vehicle manufacturer KAMAG – SPMTs from KAMAG are used as ballast trailers.Find out more",Press releases,12/09/2020,"When it bought an LR 11000, Sarens came to Liebherr with the idea of investigating whether SPMTs (self-propelled modular transporters) could be used as ballast trailers. The benefit for the global heavy haulage contractor is obvious – it has KAMAG K24 SPMTs at almost all of its outlets.The ideaThe idea was not completely new, as Liebherr had already tried similar solutions with other crane models. However, to date the SPMTs had never been controlled direct from the crane. Separate personnel had to communicate with the crane operator and enabled the SPMTs to track the crane’s movements.Everybody involved in the project agreed that a solution now had to be developed to allow the SPMTs to be controlled by the crane’s control system, just like a standard ballast trailer.The developmentSarens provided Liebherr with two K24 SPMTs from KAMAG for the development and testing work. And it soon became clear that it worked! Not only did the developers from KAMAG and Liebherr get on very well indeed, but so did the crane and the alternative ballast trailers. Technical Director Carl Sarens and Project Engineer Hendrik Sanders saw the whole thing in action in October at the test site. And they were extremely impressed by the progress made in the project. Carl Sarens explains: We are very satisfied with the results and the collaboration with Liebherr and KAMAG. All our requirements have been met and we are confident that this will deliver significant added value for future projects as a result of the operative benefits and flexibility.”KAMAG developed a special control box to ensure good communication between the crane and SPMT, enabling the crawler crane to control the movements of the heavy haulage vehicles. One helpful aspect of this was the fact that the Liebherr LICCON control system and the KAMAG control system have similar basic structures.. The solutionJens Könneker from Liebherr Lattice Boom Cranes Product Management was able to demonstrate a fully functional solution in November at an internal presentation – circling, moving in parallel, towing – everything works in exactly the same way as on a standard ballast trailer. “Everybody involved here is delighted with the good collaboration with KAMAG and Sarens and the result is sensational”, says Könneker.To ensure that the tests could be started quickly at Liebherr, trials were conducted with a “standard ballast trailer without wheelsets” and a specially designed test adapter. Sarens’ LR 11000 is supplied to the customer as planned with a suspended ballast pallet. This is then placed on the SPMTs for jobs which require a “ballast trailer”, using a special adapter. If the “ballast trailer” is not required, the crane operates using suspended ballast. In this case the SPMTs can be used for other purposes – an economical solution.About SarensSarens is the global leader and reference in crane rental services, heavy lifting, and engineered transport.

"Lorban TP opts for performance, flexibility and comfort: Liebherr R 945",Press releases |12/08/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/lorban-tp-opts-for-performance-flexibility-and-comfort-liebherr-r-945.html?page=79,"Lorban TP deals with the extraction and loading of limestone at the Carrières du Bassin de la Sambre (C.B.S.). These quarries produce 600,000 tonnes of limestone granulate annually for industry, construction and civil engineering.Find out more",Press releases,12/08/2020,"Lorban TP was looking for a high-performance machine with short loading cycle times. The excavator was required to operate a hydraulic hammer, to break up the the rock, as well as a shovel to load it into the dump trucks. The company chose the new Liebherr Generation 8 R 945 crawler excavator to replace a Generation 6 R 946. The Generation 8 range of crawler excavator comprises 7 models and was launched at Bauma Munich in 2019. The R 945 is the replacement model for the Generation 6 R 950 SME. These machines put a new architectural concept into application that has enabled optimised operating performance, comfort, ergonomics and safety.. The R 945 crawler excavator combines flexibility and performanceJean-Pierre Deruelle, the only driver of the R 945, previously worked with an R 946 excavator. When comparing the old and new generations, he noticed both an increase in performance and an increase in stability. He also appreciates the comfort of the cab and the smoothness of the movements that make the R 945 an ideal work tool. The spacious and air-conditioned cab is equipped with an air-sprung seat with vertical and longitudinal shock absorption. The R 945 achieves higher outputs than the old R 946, and has an engine output of 220 kW compared to the 200 kW of its predecessor. The average fuel consumption is 28.5 litres per hour. The engine efficiency of the Generation 8 excavators meets the European standard of Exhaust Gas Stage V. The transition to idling and the start-up are controlled automatically.. The right excavator for the company's requirementsThe R 945 crawler excavator is equipped with an HDR bucket with a 2.5 m³ capacity for loading the granules into the dump trucks and can be fitted with a hydraulic hammer for crushing the rock. The machine was perfectly adapted to the company's requirements. It is equipped with a 6.15 m long SME monobloc jib with SWA 66 hydraulic quick change system. The driver appreciates the new LED lighting on the latest generation machines. The lighting is more powerful, has a longer reach and a longer service life than the halogen system of the predecessor model. The brightness of the LED headlights can be switched with a single press of the joystick button, which is very convenient for the operator. The stability and dynamics of the excavator enable loading cycle times to be shortened, thus increasing production output. A loading cycle takes between 14 and 15 seconds. The time required to load an articulated dumper truck in the 30-tonne class is 1 minute and 20 seconds in 7 cycles.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

The Port of Grenaa goes for green e-drive,Press releases |12/04/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/the-port-of-grenaa-goes-for-green-e-drive.html?page=79,"The Port of Grenaa relies on Liebherr Mobile Harbour Crane technology and is renewing its equipment. In order to have not only more efficient but also more ecological handling in the future, the Port of Grenaa decided to have a new electric drive built into the LHM 550.Find out more",Press releases,12/04/2020,"Grenaa is a port city on the Kattegat and forms the geographical centre of Denmark. The port of Grenaa is one of Denmark's largest commercial and industrial ports. In October, the Port of Grenaa ordered a Liebherr mobile harbour crane type LHM 550.As one of the existing cranes was no longer up to date, the port decided to upgrade its equipment and increase its performance with new mobile harbour crane technology. For this reason, the port authorities decided to purchase a Liebherr LHM 550 mobile harbour crane, which is by far the most frequently sold model in the LHM portfolio with more than 250 units delivered.E-Drive upgradeThe demand for sustainable, environmentally sensitive operation and for low-emission cargo handling cranes is becoming increasingly important. Also, the Danish port of Grenaa wants to strengthen its green profile with the locally emission-free drive. Before the LHM 550, which was previously in service in Finland for three years, is delivered to the port of Grenaa, it is given an upgrade at Liebherr's maritime headquarters in Rostock, Germany. Here the LHM 550 will be fitted with an electric drive, which will significantly reduce future emissions when handling goods.With its 54 metres long boom and a maximum lifting capacity of 144 tonnes, the LHM 550 covers a wide range of handling options. In addition to the hydrostatic drive, the mobility of the LHM is a decisive advantage for the customer. All wheel sets are individually steerable and have load balancing, whereby the ground pressure for each wheel does not exceed six tonnes. Furthermore, the 360° mobility ensures highest maneuverability. This is a decisive advantage at all quays and terminals.. The Port of GrenaaThe port of Grenaa has a history of more than 200 years. It has grown from a fishing and ferry port. Over the years the port has broadened its work to bulk activities as well as project and stacking activities. The construction of the Anholt offshore wind farm in 2013 gave the port of Grenaa national and international recognition as a thoroughly proficient wind turbine port. This makes it one of Denmark’s leading industrial ports for wind turbine projects.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region: Generation 8 crawler excavators for various applications,Press releases |12/03/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/nouvelle-aquitaine-region-generation-8-crawler-excavators-for-various-applications.html?page=79,"Each and every one of the new Liebherr Generation 8 crawler excavators is designed around a completely new basic concept to give a more powerful and comfortable machine. Higher engine output and a heavier ballast weight for higher bucket capacities, as well as a new, specially developed boom concept which optimises the load curve and rotational inertia and thus also reduces fuel consumption.Find out more",Press releases,12/03/2020,"An overview of the various customer applications of Generation 8 crawler excavators in the south-west of France.. Groupe Cassous uses its Liebherr R 922 Generation 8 crawler excavator at the Bio Centre du Sud-Ouest subsidiary to treat contaminated soil. The machine is equipped with an adjustable boom, which allows greater manoeuvrability, efficiency and speed when working from the same position. This machine is the first in the series to be delivered by the Liebherr subsidiary in Bordeaux after the model was launched in 2019. The already well-known comfort of the Liebherr cab, the most spacious in its class, has been further optimised. This has been achieved in particular through a new layout of the controls and improved ergonomics. The R 922 has already completed more than 650 operating hours.. An R 924 crawler excavator will be used by Fayat TP at a site of its subsidiary LN Maurice for disposal and slope work. The comfort for the operator and the dynamics of the machine allow a high production capacity per day.In Bordeaux, BDS uses its new R 926 exclusively for demolition work. The stability, robustness and dynamics of this new generation of Liebherr crawler excavators allow maximum efficiency and productivity in all conditions and even for the most demanding activities. The Lefort company carries out both earthmoving and demolition work with its R 930, which is possible thanks, among other things, to the stability, precision and working speed of the machine. With an average consumption of 14 l per hour, the R 930 is very fuel-efficient.. What is even more impressive is that a new-generation R 934 is being tested by a Liebherr customer while building a golf course. Maximum productivity is essential in the excavation and repositioning of soil for the course layout, which is achieved thanks to the high bucket capacity of up to 2.50 m3.Finally, the R 945 at Colas' Sarrazy subsidiary, in its “multi-user” configuration with a 10.70 m boom and 7.70 m dipper arm, is used to clean the sludge tanks of the group's gravel pits across the region. On-board systems such as Liebherr's on-demand power control and Positive Control hydraulic system ensure the right speeds to penetrate the bottom of the excavation pit. As with the entire new generation, fuel consumption is very satisfactory at around 20 l per hour.. First introductory phase completed: the new generation of Liebherr crawler excavatorsThe first introductory phase of the new generation of Liebherr crawler excavators, which started in 2019, currently comprises of 7 models (R 922, R 924, R 926, R 930, R 934, R 938 and R 945). This new generation is characterised by maximum safety, maximum comfort, in particular the spacious and ergonomically revised cab, the wide range of lighting that can be adjusted as required for a better view of the machine environment, and simplified access for maintenance operations. The machine's major strengths have been further enhanced by increasing the engine power and thus the overall machine output. Moreover, the new models consume significantly less fuel than older models, resulting in greater efficiency. In the future, 50 to 100 tonne Liebherr crawler excavators will also be added to Generation 8.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Creating trust in the Caribbean – crane and heavy haulage contractor Força chooses Liebherr for used crane purchases ,Press releases |12/02/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/creating-trust-in-the-caribbean-crane-and-heavy-haulage-contractor-forca-chooses-liebherr-for-used-crane-purchases.html?page=79,"Buying used cranes requires a good deal of trust. Since it was founded, Liebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH has delivered more than 10,000 used cranes to customers throughout the world. The market leader for mobile cranes is in fact also the largest used crane dealer in the world. Crane and heavy haulage contractor Força Diseño & Ingenieria SRL based in the Dominican Republic has shown great trust in Liebherr and has taken delivery of six used cranes in a short period of time.Find out more",Press releases,12/02/2020,"Força has the most modern crane fleet both in the Dominican Republic and also in the whole of the Caribbean. Força decided to purchase used mobile cranes as a lower cost alternative to buying new ones. The company chose Liebherr. Company owner Jhon Modesto explains: “We can buy used cranes from Liebherr which have been inspected carefully and are in perfect condition or have been repaired by Liebherr. Nobody else offers the same service. Normally, we would have to buy used machines as-seen from the USA. But we have to accept that there is a high level of uncertainty about the technical condition the machines.”The package bought by the company included two LTM 1130-5.1 cranes, an LTM 1200-5.1 and an LTM 1220-5.2. They had been factory-refurbished by Liebherr and some of them had even been repainted. The main areas of use in the Dominican Republic include service and expansion work at electricity plants, work in the mining industry and port expansion projects.. “As we do not have a service outlet for mobile cranes near us, the quality of the machines is very important, of course, as is the fast, reliable delivery of spare parts. This is where Liebherr comes into its own as it is the manufacturer as well, and its outlet in Mexico is a very good partner with which we can communicate in our own language. They provide fast assistance whenever we need it. We can sort out the majority of our technical questions and problems using the telephone and video without a service engineer having to travel for hours to get here. We have 24/7 access to the well trained service engineers from Liebherr México. That was another major criterion in our purchase decision,” adds Modesto.Liebherr México S. de R.L. de C.V. looks after the market in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Despite the fact that the sheer size of this massive area poses a major challenge, Liebherr offers its customers throughout the region its full range of sales and after-sales service in Liebherr’s famous high quality – and this includes used cranes.Liebherr has a wide selection of used mobile and crawler cranes. Crane experts inspect every machine before it is sold to ensure that used cranes also deliver maximum safety. Depending on what the customer wants, inspections, technical acceptance procedures and even complete factory refurbishments with new paintwork and signwriting are possible. Liebherr can also supply its own used cranes with a warranty – and is the only manufacturer in the world to do so.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

World Premiere: Three new Machines and one new Design,Press releases |12/01/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/world-premiere-three-new-machines-and-one-new-design.html?page=80,"Innovations have been the driving force at Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH from the very beginning. The year 2020 is no exception. Product developments are in full swing. Today three new machines from the fields deep foundation, material handling and lifting could be unveiled in our online presentation. What was striking about it: all models gleam in a new design.Find out more",Press releases,12/01/2020,"DesignAll colour compositions in the latest generation combine the classic Liebherr yellow with new black, grey and white accents. The design reflects how long-standing tradition and company values unite with advanced technologies. The elegant colour scheme prevails through all product groups and lends the machines a distinctive look and immediate recognition.The new design focuses on an even higher level of safety emphasised, above all, by improved platforms and railings on the uppercarriage. Thanks to the additional add-on wing for mounting lights or cameras, the design is more flexible on the whole.Inside the new cabin the operator experiences immediately how the overall concept fits harmoniously together: reduced noise, panoramic view and pure operator comfort. This is achieved through a modern air-conditioning system with improved airflow, an optimised field of vision and an orthopaedic operator’s seat with integrated heating and cooling. Additional safety is provided by the stone protection, even in the toughest of applications.. Deep Foundation– LRB 23: The Continuation of a Success StoryThe compact piling and drilling rig type LRB 23 closes the gap between the LRB 16 and the long-proven LRB 355.The new all-rounder for deep foundation work offers an impressive engine output of 600 kW and so delivers the necessary capacity for all common deep foundation work, such as drilling with a Kelly drill, double rotary drill, full displacement equipment and continuous flight auger, as well as soil mixing and applications with a vibrator or hydraulic hammer.Its compact design allows for transportation of the LRB 23 in one piece, so simplifying mobilisation between jobsites. The remote control simplifies the loading process for transportation as well as the assembly of the machine.The advantages of the rigid leader are proven in operation. As it can withstand high torques even Kelly drilling is possible, which is unique for a machine of this size! The rotary drive BAT 300 delivers a maximum torque of 300 kNm.Locking of the Kelly bar’s telescopic sections is made significantly easier with the aid of the Kelly visualization system in the LRB 23. Thanks to the real time display of the Kelly bar’s locking recesses on the cabin monitor, the operator is permanently informed about the actual distance to the next locking recess. Colour indications inform when the bar can be locked. Furthermore, false positioning of the Kelly bar during the shake-off process is indicated through a warning signal.During continuous flight auger drilling the concreting process is automated thanks to the drilling assistant. All assistance systems contribute to time savings, higher availability of the machine and a significant increase in safety during operation. The newly designed piling and drilling rig convinces through precision, high performance and a long service life.. Material Handling – HS 8070.1: The All-Rounder: Versatile and Flexible With the brand new HS 8070.1, Liebherr unveils the newest generation of duty cycle crawler cranes. The machine has a lifting capacity of 70 tonnes and is the first choice for a multitude of applications: material handling, deep foundation work or lifting work.Using the new self-loading system (Jack-Up System) the crawlers can be easily disassembled for transportation, so reducing the transport weight to less than 35 t. The platforms and railings must no longer be removed before transporting.Instead of a single counterweight, the machine now has a modular system. The duty cycle crawler crane can be individually equipped depending on the application. Further, the boom of the HS 8070.1 is compatible with the HS 8100.1. Therefore, customers can use attachments such as the slurry wall grab HSG 5-18 on both machines and install thicker slurry walls with a more compact machine.As opposed to the fixed system, the new floating A-frame system ensures higher performance in dynamic applications. It also simplifies and speeds up the assembly and transportation of the machine. The user-friendly design extends to the tank neck, which is easily accessible via a platform on the uppercarriage – a perfect example of the modern design strategy.. Lifting – LR 1200.1 unplugged and LR 1250.1 unplugged: The World’s First Battery-Powered Crawler CraneThe LR 1200.1 unplugged and the LR 1250.1 unplugged are the world’s first battery-powered crawler cranes. Both are driven by electric engines with a system performance of 255 kW.There are no compromises regarding performance or availability when compared with the conventional versions. The LR 1200.1 unplugged has a maximum lifting capacity of 200 tonnes and the LR 1250.1 lifts 250 tonnes.The blue accent in the colour composition, which lends the distinctive look to the unplugged series, symbolises the electric solution representing an advanced technology. The unplugged cranes achieve the best possible combination of operator benefit, efficiency and environmental sustainability.Thanks to Zero Emission the new machines are emission free and have a very low noise level. That is a huge advantage in areas sensitive to noise and also for the people working on the jobsite.The cranes can be recharged on a conventional jobsite electric supply (32 A, 63 A) in 4.5 hours and optionally with 125 A in 2.25 hours. The capacity of the battery is designed for 4 hours lifting operation. In accordance with their name, the cranes can be operated without a cable, thus “unplugged” thanks to the battery-electric drive design.“Especially the year 2020 has shown that one must be open-minded and bold to break new ground. With our unplugged cranes we offer our customers an alternative drive design. As we have already seen with the LB 16 unplugged, the first battery-powered drilling rig, the strategy is a complete success. Strict requirements regarding environmental sustainability in tenders for construction projects increase the demand for advanced technologies. For us, it was clear that we extend and successfully establish the design in further product groups,” says Gerhard Frainer, Managing Director for Sales at Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH..

An LRT 1100-2.1 rough terrain crane was officially handed over to Polish energy company PGE GiEK on 10 November – in virtual form due to the coronavirus pandemic. Liebherr first opened its plant for mobile cranes in Ehingen in 1969 and supplied its 20,000th crane in 2006. Number 30,000 followed just eight years later. The next 10,000 cranes were built in just six years.Find out more",Press releases,11/30/2020,"PGE GiEK - PGE Górnictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna Spółka Akcyjna is part of the largest group of companies in the energy sector in Poland, the PGE Capital Group. PGE GiEK operates two lignite mines and five power plants in various regions of Poland. The company has been using Liebherr all-terrain and rough terrain cranes for decades. At the same time as the LRT 1100-2.1, the company also took delivery of an LTM 1030-2.1.The decision to buy the 100 tonne crane of the new LRT rough terrain crane series from Liebherr was also based on the high level of satisfaction within the company with the cranes from the old LTL series. The oldest crane still in the service of the Polish company is an 80 tonne model at the site in Bogatynia. The LTL 1080 was built in 1991 and has clocked over 19,100 hours of service.Christoph Kleiner, Sales Director at Liebherr in Ehingen, thanked PGE for the trust the company placed in its products: “Thank you very much for the decades we have been partners. We are delighted to celebrate this special anniversary together with one of our loyal LTL and LTR series customers. We would also like to thank you for placing your trust in our LTM series in addition to our rough terrain cranes. You can rest assured that we will continue to do everything in our power to continue our successful collaboration.”PGE GiEK mainly uses Liebherr cranes for maintaining and repairing mining machines, building access roads on mining sites and for installing and dismantling conveyor belts.A history of successful cranesLiebherr-Werk Ehingen GmbH first opened for business in 1969 as a subsidiary of what was then a one-man business, Hans Liebherr. The production of mobile cranes and ship cranes started that same year. The plant supplied its first crawler cranes in 1978. These had lifting capacities of over 500 tonnes.As a result of the rising capacity requirements for the ever increasing range of mobile cranes, a decision was taken to concentrate solely on mobile cranes in Ehingen as from 1980, and to relocate the production of ship, offshore and container cranes to Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH.The truck crane product series was converted into the new LTM all-terrain crane series as from the mid-80s. This new crane generation featured completely new technology for combined road and off-road use and became extremely popular with customers in Germany and beyond, forming the basis for Liebherr becoming the market leader in mobile cranes. Today, approximately every second all-terrain mobile crane delivered anywhere in the world comes from Liebherr.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Liebherr MK 88 Plus mobile construction crane in Rotterdam: cost-effective and quiet continuous operation using site power,Press releases |11/26/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-mk-88-plus-mobile-construction-crane-in-rotterdam-cost-effective-and-quiet-continuous-operation-using-site-power.html?page=80,A Liebherr MK 88 Plus mobile construction crane from Dutch crane hire company Boekestijn was in operation for three months in Rotterdam for the construction of a new plant for recycling asphalt material. Noteworthy: the flexible crane operated continuously in site power mode on the construction site in the Dutch port metropolis.Find out more,Press releases,11/26/2020,"“Our MK mobile construction cranes are in increasing demand from sites requiring low noise emissions,” reports Lianne Boekestijn, following the completion of her crane’s assignment in the industrial district of South Holland’s port city. Crane operator Danny van Vliet was able to carry out the work there with his Liebherr mobile construction crane exclusively in electric operation and therefore without engine noise and pollutant emissions. Over the summer months, the MK 88 Plus from Kraanverhuur Boekestijn helped to construct a 25-metre high plant for the recycling of asphalt. The MK 88 Plus was in continuous operation, from structural steelwork and the assembly of plant components to the cladding of the newly constructed building.. Steering programs for good manoeuvrability and fast crane repositioningAs the available space for ongoing crane operation was limited at the plant site, the four-axle mobile construction crane was perfect for the job at hand. “The MK 88 Plus was the right crane for this assignment thanks to its ability to change location quickly, which is due to its excellent manoeuvrability,” explains Lianne Boekestijn. But the tower height of just over 30 metres was also decisive for carrying out the work, during which the crane had to be able to lift loads of up to 6.2 tonnes.. The company has many years of experience with Liebherr mobile cranes. MK 80, MK 88 and MK 100 model cranes became part of Boekestijn’s extensive fleet early on. In 2017, the first MK 88 Plus was ordered from Biberach – today, the company’s fleet includes three such cranes. “This mobile construction crane distinguishes itself above all else through its compact design, outstanding manoeuvrability thanks to multiple steering programs, and its greater tower height compared to the four-axle cranes of competitors,” says Boekestijn. “Plus, it's a considerable advantage that Liebherr enables the luffed jib position to be adjusted from the crane cab. And the electric operation option means we save around 33 litres of fuel per day when the crane is operating at full capacity.”Boekestijn’s three cranes are in great demand on construction sites. “The cranes are mainly used for steel construction and roof work as part of residential and industrial construction but also for installing antennas and air conditioning systems as well as for building maintenance in urban areas,” enumerates Lianne Boekestijn. Not only is the company active in the Netherlands with its total of 46 cranes, but regularly in Belgium and Germany as well. Its larger telescopic cranes are also used throughout Northern and Western Europe. Boekestijn’s portfolio includes heavy haulage and machinery transport, equipment hire and project management..

LTM 1050-3.1 makes “Muse” art project possible by hoisting a grand piano into a forest clearing,Press releases |11/25/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/ltm-1050-3-1-makes-muse-art-project-possible-by-hoisting-a-grand-piano-into-a-forest-clearing.html?page=80,"ESB Kranverleih Transport und Hebetechnik GmbH received an order for a very unusual job in spring 2020 – a valuable grand piano had to be hoisted into a cleared section of forest near Erolzheim in southern Germany and set up there to be played. The order was placed by Andreas Reiner, a German photographer and artist, known by the name Sichtlich Mensch. He was producing the “Muse” project in this clearing – a short film about humanity and vulnerability.Find out more",Press releases,11/25/2020,"Mittelbiberach-based company ESB Kranverleih and Managing Director Karl Engeser had never come across a project quite like it. “It was quite exciting to be part of a such an unusual project. After we received the enquiry, we first of all took a look at the location”, he says. The section of forest had been cleared after suffering storm damage. Engeser thinks back: “We looked for a suitable access route and a place which had the required stability to set up the crane.” ESB finally managed to set up an LTM 1050-3.1 close to the clearing. The 50 tonne crane then hoisted the 400 kilogram grand piano into the required location from a distance of 25 metres.. In perfect weather conditions, a very special, moving mood was developed in this “injured” section of forest – volunteers gathered around the piano, stripping naked to express the vulnerability of humanity. Well-known German pianist Dirk Maassen played a range of sensitive, dreamlike music and created a unique atmosphere. The resultant film can be viewed online free of charge..

Schuch expands fleet with three new Liebherr mobile cranes,Press releases |11/24/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/schuch-expands-fleet-with-three-new-liebherr-mobile-cranes.html?page=80,Crane contractor Schuch is modernising its fleet with three new Liebherr mobile cranes. The LTC 1050-3.1 compact crane and two LTM 1070-4.2 mobile cranes have been added to the Schuch Group fleet in Germany. The company is readying itself to face current and future challenges on the market by means of continuous new and replacement purchases as well as innovative crane technology.Find out more,Press releases,11/24/2020,"Tim Schuch, one of the Managing Directors of the family-run company, the third generation to be in charge of it, explains: “It is important to keep our crane fleet up with the very latest crane technology to ensure that we can provide our customers with the best possible service. Liebherr is an important partner in this respect. We have been buying from Liebherr for 35 years. Firstly, the quality is impressive and secondly, Liebherr continuously develops innovative crane technology which moves the crane industry forwards.”Schuch already has several LTM 1070-4.2 cranes and says that the 50 metre telescopic boom is a major criterion behind the decision to buy the new models. “However, we also believe that the VarioBase® variable support base is extremely important because it makes jobs safer and increases our flexibility on site,” adds Schuch.Schuch also has an LTC 1050-3.1 in its fleet already. Its high lifting capacity and compact dimensions were the main reasons for investing in another crane of this type. Schuch also ordered some optional equipment on its new 50 tonne compact crane, which significantly enhances safety for crane jobs – in addition to VarioBase®, the new crane was also ordered with the height-adjustable crane cabin and the new RemoteDrive remote control. Schuch continues: “Controlling the chassis by remote is a really great innovation for constricted sites or inside factory buildings. At the moment, it is only available from Liebherr.”The new mobile cranes have been specially purchased for the company’s outlets in Frankfurt, Karlsruhe and Kaiserslautern and will mainly be used for turnkey commercial, industrial and house building.The Schuch Group has 10 sites between Saarbrücken in the west, Frankfurt in the north and Karlsruhe in the south. The company has a 120-strong workforce and specialises in crane work with a total of around 80 mobile cranes.. DownloadsHier finden Sie die Pressemitteilung und Bilder zum Download..

Bridge-builder – LR 1800-1.0 links previously divided Berlin neighbourhoods of Moabit and Mitte,Press releases |11/19/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/bridge-builder-lr-1800-1-0-links-previously-divided-berlin-neighbourhoods-of-moabit-and-mitte.html?page=80,"“What belongs together will grow together” was how Willy Brandt, the former German Chancellor, described the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989. Over 30 years later, another example of how the country is still growing together was played out in Berlin. By completing its very first job, the new Liebherr LR 1800-1.0 crawler crane owned by crane and heavy haulage contractor MaxiKraft played a major role in this process.Find out more",Press releases,11/19/2020,"The new 800 tonne crawler crane hoisted a new pedestrian and cycle bridge over the Berlin-Spandau Ship Canal to connect the previously divided neighbourhoods of Moabit and Mitte. The Golda-Meir-Steg, as the 78 metre bridge is called, was named after the former Israeli Prime Minister.The steel bridge was built in Deggendorf and had to be transported 1600 km by barge using inland waterways to get it from Bavaria to Berlin. The enormous LR 1800-1.0 crawler crane hoisted the new bridge off the barge right on schedule on 22 October. It was then turned into position using rope and man power before being lowered carefully by the crane.. The challenge for the MaxiKraft team was that there was very little space for the crane and its equipment at the site. That meant that the various components had to be delivered in precisely the correct order that they were required to set up the crane.Another difficulty was the fact that the crawler crane had to be moved ten metres back from the originally planned site so as not to damage or displace the pile foundations used to secure the bank of the canal and to build the abutment for the bridge. That meant it had to operate with an additional ten metre radius to install the 195 tonne bridge – 48 metres rather than the 38 metres, which had been calculated originally. Equipped with a 66 metre main boom, derrick system and suspended ballast with the V-frame, 70 tonnes of central ballast, 170 tonnes of slewing platform ballast and 380 tonnes of derrick ballast, the LR 1800-1.0 overcame this challenge with flying colours.. The V frame, a hydraulically adjustable ballast system which enables enormous adjustment distances with a ballast radius of between 14 and 23 metres, was once again worth its weight in gold for this job. It delivers maximum flexibility compared to the standard rigid system for large ballast radii. The derrick ballast had to be extended to the maximum radius of 23 metres to install the bridge..

“Expectations were high” – new LB Series in operation,Press releases |11/18/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/expectations-were-high-new-lb-series-in-operation.html?page=80,"The company Kurt Motz Baubetriebsgesellschaft GmbH in Illertissen (Germany) decided on 5 machines from Liebherr’s brand new series of drilling rigs. Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH recently handed over the key for the LB 45, which is already successfully operating on its first jobsite.Find out more",Press releases,11/18/2020,"“We have maintained a close partnership for many years,” says Wolfgang Bucher, Leading Site Manager at Kurt Motz. “Suggestions for improvement are discussed constructively and applied quickly. That makes it possible for us to complete complicated construction projects without any problems.” The company has been a customer of Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH since the introduction of the series of drilling rigs and received the very first LRB 125.Kurt Motz attaches a lot of importance to being on the cutting edge of technology. Therefore, between October 2020 and March 2021, the company is gradually converting to the new LB series from Liebherr with these 5 machines. Recently Christoph Dona, Sales Manager at Liebherr-Werk Nenzing GmbH, was able to hand over the key for the LB 45 to Wolfgang Bucher. One LB 20.1, one LB 25 and two LB 30s will follow.Even more flexibility A decisive factor for exchanging the machines was the huge advantages in flexibility. The modular leader can be easily converted from the standard to a low head version. Remote control facilitates safe loading and unloading of the machine on or from the low loader, or assists during assembly. Machine operator Anestis Papanikolaou adds, “The new assistance systems such as Kelly Visualization and Ground Pressure Indication make life a lot easier. You can feel the 10 % more power of the LB 45 over its predecessor immediately.” Thomas Markus, Workshop Manager at Kurt Motz, also emphasizes the good customer service with excellent advice and fast parts deliveries.. Features for higher safety and easier operation The ground load-bearing capacity and the monitoring of the ground pressure are decisive for the safe operation of a machine. The Ground Pressure Visualization of the LB 45 calculates the current ground pressure of the machine in real time and compares it with the specified safety limits of the relevant jobsite. The ground pressure is displayed in the operator's cab and the operator is permanently aware of whether the machine is situated in, or is approaching, a critical area. Dangerous work stages can so be avoided or adapted in good time.Locking of the Kelly bar’s telescopic sections is made significantly easier due to the Kelly Visualization system in the LB 45. Thanks to the real time display of the Kelly bar’s locking recesses on the cabin monitor, the operator is permanently informed of the actual distance to the next locking recess. Colour indications inform when the bar can be locked. Furthermore, false positioning of the Kelly bar during the shake-off process is indicated through a warning signal. All assistance systems contribute to time savings, higher availability of the machine and a significant increase in safety during operation.First deployment The LB 45 celebrated its premiere directly with Liebherr. A fully automated high-bay warehouse is being built at the works in Ehingen and Kurt Motz was awarded the contract for the foundation piles. Approximately 450 piles, equivalent to about 9,000 drilling metres, will be installed by the brand new LB 45 together with the drilling rig LB 28 using the Kelly drilling method.Machine operator Anestis Papanikolaou gives an encouraging feedback, “The expectations of the LB 45 were high, but they have been fulfilled 100 %.”.

Extraordinary project – Liebherr 5-axle crane floated to site on a barge,Press releases |11/17/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/extraordinary-project-liebherr-5-axle-crane-floated-to-site-on-a-barge.html?page=80,"It was not the job but accessing the site which posed a major challenge to crane contractor Movitram Grúas in Colombia. An LTM 1220-5.2 was required in the mountainous, forested coffee region to install a bridge. Movitram Grúas did everything it could possibly do to get the crane to the remote site. This included the Liebherr 220 tonne crane undergoing an eight kilometre river voyage on a barge on the Rio Cauca. Movitram Grúas S.A.S. based in Pereira, Dosquebradas, Risaralda, Colombia, provides integrated solutions for hoisting and transport work in the coffee region of Colombia.Find out more",Press releases,11/17/2020,"By water, land or air? The “Autopista pacífico 2” site, a motorway, tunnel and bridge construction project in the remote forested, high altitude coffee region of Colombia needed a 220 tonne mobile crane. But the only access route by land included a bridge which the crane could not cross due to its 72 tonne operating weight. Carlos Enrique Parra Ibagón, Managing Director of Movitram Grúas S.A.S, and his team carefully weighed up all the options. Finally, they decided to transport the LTM 1220-5.2 to the site by water. However, this required extensive calculations and safety precautions as well as obtaining a series of permits.. “First of all, it was a major challenge to get the crane on the water at all. There was no road, which meant we had to make several modifications to off-road routes”, explains Parra. The correct timing, taking into account high and low water, was also extremely important for the project. Parra continues: “Precise levelling and perfect securing for the cargo were essential. There has never been a job like this one. It was an extraordinary project.” After a journey time of three hours, the LTM 1220-5.2 finally reached the site undamaged. Low loaders transported the equipment and ballast weights. Once it had arrived at the site, the 220-tonne crane completed several jobs including erecting a tower crane and installing 25 reinforced concrete box channels, each weighing 20 tonnes.. Carlos Enrique Parra Ibagón was extremely satisfied: “Transporting the crane on the water has many benefits and there is a great deal of potential for it. In some cases, the distances are significantly shorter. The road network in Colombia is pretty poor and permits are expensive. Transporting cranes by water could take heavy haulage vehicles off the crumbling roads.” Colombia is currently investing in making its rivers navigable. The plan is to create better links between the production and consumer centres inside the country at places such as Bogotá, Medellín and the Coffee Triangle and the ports on the Caribbean coast..

Space limited in Downtown Milan: Liebherr LTM 1350-6.1 convinces with Y-guying,Press releases |11/16/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/space-limited-in-downtown-milan-liebherr-ltm-1350-6-1-convinces-with-y-guying.html?page=81,"Being involved in supporting activities for the redevelopment project of a skyscraper complex in downton Milan, Italy, Casella Autogrù choose their Liebherr LTM 1350-6.1 mobile crane to place air conditioning units on the rooftop of a 63 m skyscraper. Crane operator Claudio Lozza lifted the 12.5 t weights carefully with a radius of 45 m under a bit of time pressure, as the road traffic had to be cut off for all the activities period in the sprawling city center.Find out more",Press releases,11/16/2020,"Milan, a lively town in the North of Italy and famous for its cathedral and shopping malls, is also one of the biggest Italian business areas. Every day, restructurings and redevelopments are taking place, as the space in the city center and even the metropolean area is tight and limited. Casella Autogrù was therefore tasked to take part in the redevelopment of a skyscraper complex in downtown Milan. The complex consists of seven tower building, mainly used for offices and being closely built together. Casella was instructed to place the air conditioning units on the roof top of a 18 floor skyscraper, therefore a lifting height of 70 meters was needed. Their choice for the task was the LTM 1350-6.1. The weight of the single units to be lifted was announced with 12.5 t.. The main challenge – limited spaceThe main challenge was the limitation of space as the lift took place in the Milan city center. The 350 t crane, installed with the maximum ballast of 100 t, had to be positioned on the center of the roadway. As the road is quite narrow, the outriggers had to be postioned half on the road an half on the side walk on two different heights. During the setup and lift, the road had to be sealed off – therefore time was the second limiting factor on this job.The new air conditioning units with their 12.5 t had to be lifted to the 63 meter high rooftop with a radius of 45 meters. Therefore the Y-guying system was needed to support the telescopic boom with the lattice jib attached, a TYVEN configuration. The LTM 1350-6.1 is the smallest crane featuring a Y-guying system.. A challenging job for Claudio LozzaArriving first thing in the morning, crane operator Claudio Lozza and his colleagues were really busy to keep the timings during all the job. About eight hours of preparation and two hours with loads on the hook, the day was quite demanding for Claudio, as he explained the job: “The Y-guying system allowed us to benefit from incredible load capacities while guaranteeing reduced dimensions – this was the crucial point during this job. In a nutshell, the Liebherr LTM 1350-6.1 mobile crane is flexible, compact and powerful! Using such a crane for this type of work is really joyful for me."" And Claudio is looking forward to the next jobs: “It’s always challenging to operate in metropolitan areas, no matter if you are in the open field, in one of the many industrial plants or in the city center – always a question of timing, traffic and limited space. But with this extrodinary crane, handling gets easy and the work is fun.”Casella Autogrù: 60 years of proud company historyCasella Autogrù, based in Piacenza (about 60 km from Milan), a strategic location from a logistical point of view, was founded in 1960. In the early 90ties, the Villa family took over the management of Casella Autogrù, providing – with commitment, passion and determination – a decisive push towards new and even more ambitious goals: the mobile crane rental business started beside the existing activities of transportation, the assembly of prefabricated structures and the chartering of aerial platforms. The mobile crane fleet was constantly renewed and shortly after taking over the business, the first Liebherr cranes came in.Today, being in the market for 60 years, Casella Autogrù operates 31 vehicles, including cranes, electric cranes, road tractors as well as support vehicles and operates throughout Italy and Europe. The areas of application are very varied and include, among others, the construction and maintenance of infrastructure at national level, industrial handling of machinery and plants in all major production sectors..

Liebherr heavy-duty crane loads monopiles,Press releases |11/12/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-heavy-duty-crane-loads-monopiles.html?page=81,Successful project completion: The new TCC 78000 heavy-duty gantry crane from Liebherr-MCCtec Rostock GmbH loaded 72 foundation piles for Denmark's largest wind farm between May and September 2020.Find out more,Press releases,11/12/2020,"This was the first external loading for the Liebherr TCC 78000 heavy-duty gantry crane, commissioned by EEW Special Pipe Constructions GmbH in cooperation with Vattenfall. Since 2008, the Rostock-based company EEW SPC has been a pioneer in the production of monopiles, which serve as foundation piles for offshore wind turbines. With the production of more than 1,900 monopile foundation piles, the offshore wind specialist has become the market leader for the production of this type of foundation.. Successful completion of the loading activitiesDue to the flexible operating periods of the TCC 78000, the 72 monopiles were loaded using the new rail-mounted gantry crane. Delivery of the monopiles to the construction site had to be carried out just in time. This means that the assembly cycle of the installation ship 'Svanen' on the high seas set the pace for the loading in Rostock. ""We are pleased about the successful completion of the loading activities of the monopiles for the Baltic Sea wind farm Danish Kriegers Flak. With Liebherr we have a strong and reliable partner at our side and are convinced that we will continue to move great things together in the Rostock seaport in the future,"" says Heiko Mützelburg, Managing Director of EEW Special Pipe Constructions GmbH.Loading the monopiles was not an everyday job even for the experienced heavy lift team of the TCC 78000. This was because the monopiles were loaded directly into the water at berth 15 in Rostock's overseas port and then towed by two tugs to the wind farm construction site. The floatability required for this was produced on a specially provided 7,640 m² area, the so-called Plug Installation Area (PIA), on the Liebherr site. The two open sides of the tube are sealed with specially manufactured sealing caps, so-called plugs. The company Van Oord Offshore Wind Germany GmbH carried out the plug installation. Van Oord is also responsible for the construction of the wind farm on the site.Afterwards, the sealed, now floatable monopiles were transported to the berth and loaded into the water with the TCC 78000 over the quay wall. The slinging of the load on the TCC 78000 was carried out with the professional support of Liebherr employees, in the form of instructors and crane drivers under the supervision of the Liebherr Lifting Supervisor. The slightly conical monopile construction and the centre of gravity shifted in the longitudinal direction by the plug weights require exact planning as well as a precise sense of proportion and a lot experience of the team. Despite the highest safety precautions, it sometimes takes only 60 minutes from the moment the monopile is attached until the load weighing hundreds of tons floats in the water. Afterwards a deep-sea tug pulls the floating monopiles about 70 nautical miles in the direction of ""Kriegers Flak"". In total, two sea tugs were in constant rotation.EEW SPC GmbH, based in the Rostock overseas port, is the first cooperation partner to use the TCC 78000 and its experienced staff for cargo handling. However, interest in the TCC 78000 is also growing beyond Rostock's borders: ""The lifting capacity of the gantry crane with the optimum conditions for heavy-duty handling at our location is in demand. We are also increasingly handling supra-regional and international customer enquiries,"" says Udo Wosar, Head of Heavy Lift Management at Liebherr-MCCtec Rostock GmbH.. Follow up order from the Krebs GroupAt the beginning of October, the Heavy Lift Team around the TCC 78000 was able to book its second external order. A steel construction weighing 260 tons was lifted from a ship onto a barge for the company Krebs Korrosionsschutz, also based in the Rostock overseas port..

Fleet modernised – LENZ-KRAN takes delivery of Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 mobile crane,Press releases |11/12/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/fleet-modernised-lenz-kran-takes-delivery-of-liebherr-ltm-1110-5-1-mobile-crane.html?page=81,Crane and heavy haulage contractor LENZ-KRAN from Bremerhaven has modernised its fleet with a new Liebherr LTM 1110-5.1 mobile crane. The 110 tonne crane is one of the latest crane models in Liebherr’s LTM product series. Its main features are its high lifting capacities and a long telescopic boom combined with good mobility and flexibility.Find out more,Press releases,11/12/2020,"The LTM 1110-5.1 will replace a 100 tonne class mobile crane at LENZ-KRAN. Company owner Wolfgang Lenz explains: “The LTM 1110-5.1 is very innovative with its single-engine concept. It offers our customers more lifting capacity and, due to having VarioBase®, also delivers greater safety and flexibility for jobs on constricted sites”.The new crane will fit into the mid-range section of the fleet at LENZ-KRAN, which extends up to the LTM 1350-6.1. Its main areas of use will be the construction industry and repair work of container bridges at the port. Lenz has ordered a hydraulically adjustable double folding jib specially for this type of work. With its 60 metre boom, lattice extensions and lattice jib, the LTM 1110-5.1 can reach hook heights of up to 91 metres.Lenz also appreciates the great mobility and flexibility of his new 5-axle crane as it can carry 13.1 tonnes of ballast on the road with an axle load of 12 tonnes. However, it can also be driven at a gross weight of less than 48 tonnes with a maximum axle load of 10 tonnes. Even with its maximum ballast of 28.7 tonnes, its axle load remains below 15.5 tonnes. A quick-change system for the ballast slabs ensures maximum flexibility for changing the crane’s set-up.LENZ-KRAN was founded in Bremerhaven in 1986 and in addition to mobile crane hire, also provides high capacity and heavy haulage services. The company currently has a workforce of around 35 and operates nine mobile cranes, seven of which were supplied by Liebherr. Another sector in which family-run Lenz is involved is construction, where it specialises in wooden construction and assembly work..

Liebherr’s domestic appliances division publishes its third Corporate Responsibility Report,Press releases |11/10/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr%E2%80%99s-domestic-appliances-division-publishes-its-third-corporate-responsibility-report.html?page=81,"As a family business operating around the world, Liebherr has a great responsibility towards society and the environment. On 102 pages, the 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report documents the responsible and sustainable action of the domestic appliances division.Find out more",Press releases,11/10/2020,"The third Corporate Responsibility Report, published in 2019, documents the activities, performance, progress and goals of the domestic appliances division with regard to sustainable economic, ecological and social development. The report was prepared in orientation on the international guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). It records activities at the division's three European plants in Ochsenhausen, Germany, in Lienz, Austria, and in Radinovo, Bulgaria, for the years 2018 and 2019.For the first time, the domestic appliances division’s report highlights its contribution to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The domestic appliances division is able to make a significant contribution to eight of these SDGs and has set itself the goal to increase these contributions in the coming years together with its stakeholders. It makes particularly significant contributions towards goals numbers 12 (sustainable consumption and production), 11 (sustainable cities and municipalities) and 13 (climate protection measures).. The domestic appliances division and its products further reduce CO2 emissionsClimate protection is one of the most urgent problems of our time, as emphasised by the European Union’s “Green Deal” with its target of climate neutrality by 2050. The domestic appliances division has set itself ambitious goals and already achieved a great deal. For example, it has reduced CO2 emissions at its European sites by more than 60 percent in the last two years. From 2022, green electricity will be used at all European production sites. This will cut CO2 emissions by around 80 percent compared to 2017. The plan is to achieve climate neutrality in Scopes 1 and 2 at the European production sites by 2030 at the latest.If we consider the ecological footprint of a highly energy-efficient refrigerator-freezer over its entire service life (materials used, production, use, recycling), two thirds of the emissions are generated while it is in use. For less energy-efficient appliances this proportion is significantly higher. The energy efficiency of appliances therefore offers the greatest leverage for effectively contributing to climate protection. By consistently using modern and resourceefficient technologies, Liebherr has ensured that 88 percent of its domestic appliances are in the top energy efficiency classes A+++ and A++.. In 2015, the United Nations adopted the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development. In combination with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, it sets the course for a global transition towards sustainable and low-emission living and economic practices. For the domestic appliances division, it is clear that businesses and industry must make a decisive contribution to implementing the sustainability agenda – this is the only way we can create the basis for a society worth living in.The 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report and the 2019 Corporate Responsibility Fact Sheet can be downloaded from the Liebherr domestic appliances website: home.liebherr.com > Why Liebherr? > Good Reasons > A focus on sustainability and environmental responsibility.

BKL takes delivery of the very first LTM 1650-8.1 in Germany,Press releases |11/10/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/bkl-takes-delivery-of-the-very-first-ltm-1650-8-1-in-germany.html?page=81,BKL Baukran Logistik GmbH has added a Liebherr LTM 1650-8.1 to its fleet of mobile cranes. The company took delivery of the first crane of this type in Germany at the beginning of November. The main criterion for BKL was the high lifting capacity of the new 8-axle mobile crane.Find out more,Press releases,11/10/2020,"Liebherr unveiled the LTM 1650-8.1 at the Bauma 2019 with the slogan “The ultimate crane on eight axles”. Its performance backs up this claim – BKL’s new crane will be able to effortlessly complete hoisting work for customers in the 700 tonnes class or even higher.As with its predecessor, the LTM 1500-8.1, which dominated the large telescopic crane class for 20 years, Liebherr can supply the new crane with two telescopic boom lengths – 54 metres or 80 metres. A lattice jib enables the LTM 1650-8.1 to achieve hook heights of up to 151 metres and radii of up to 112 metres.BKL owner Alexander Volz comments: “Taking delivery of the first LTM 1650-8.1 in Germany means additional performance for our customers and underlines our standing as a pioneer in the crane business. The good lifting capacity values of the LTM 1650-8.1 particularly impressed us. In addition, we also expect this Liebherr crane to retain its value as well as other models. That is important to us as we continuous invest in new machines so that the BKL crane fleet remains state of the art in both the mobile crane and construction crane segments. That enables us to provide our customers at all our six sites with one of the most modern rental fleets in Europe.”The main areas of use for the Liebherr 700 tonne crane will include the installation of prefabricated parts and industrial construction. The new crane will also be used to erect and dismantle large top-slewing cranes, such as the 750 or 1050 metre-tonne tower cranes in BKL’s rental fleet as well as other tower cranes.“The LTM 1650-8.1 adds to the BKL mobile crane fleet at the top end, which means that BKL customers will have an even wider range of mobile cranes available in the future for their projects. One of the major logistics benefits of the LTM 1650-8.1 is the compatibility of the ballast slabs with other Liebherr cranes in our fleet, such as the LTM 1350-6.1 and LTM 1450-8.1”, explains Managing Director Jörg Hegestweiler.BKL has one of the largest and most modern crane fleets in Europe and continuously invests in new machines.

Modernisation – two new Liebherr mobile cranes for Würzburger Kranverleih,Press releases |11/02/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/modernisation-two-new-liebherr-mobile-cranes-for-wuerzburger-kranverleih.html?page=81,"Würzburger Kranverleih und Bergungsdienst GmbH took delivery of two new Liebherr mobile cranes in October. The family-run company will be using the LTM 1030-2.1 and LTM 1110-5.1 to modernise its fleet, 80 percent of which is made up of Liebherr cranes.Find out more",Press releases,11/02/2020,"The new LTM 1110-5.1 will replace an ageing 100 tonne crane. Company owner Ibrahim Kücükdag explains: “The LTM 1100/2 has served us well for almost 20 years, but the new crane comes with plenty of benefits. Its 60 metre telescopic boom is eight metres longer and its VarioBase® variable support base makes it suitable for a whole range of new types of work. The LTM 1110-5.1 it is also easier to set up at the site as even the maximum ballast is the same width as the vehicle”.Liebherr first unveiled the LTM 1110-5.1 at the Bauma in Munich in 2019. Its main features are its high lifting capacities, a long telescopic boom and excellent global mobility. The new 5-axle crane achieves axle loads of 12 tonnes with 13.4 tonnes of ballast, but can also be driven with a gross weight of less than 48 tonnes with a maximum axle load of 10 tonnes. Even with its maximum ballast of 29 tonnes, its axle load remains below 16 tonnes. A quick-change system for the ballast slabs ensures maximum flexibility for changing the crane’s set-up.Würzburger Kranverleih will also be using the LTM 1030-2.1 to replace an ageing Liebherr model – when it was launched more than 20 years ago, the LTM 1030-2.1 was the first mobile crane with a data bus controller. As Liebherr has repeatedly created and used innovative developments on the LTM 1030-2.1 and its other cranes, it is absolutely state of the art.Family-run Würzburger Kranverleih has a 30-strong workforce, including two sons and a daughter who already work for the company, and almost exclusively uses cranes from Liebherr – the fleet comprises 12 mobile cranes, with ten of them bearing Liebherr logo. “The operating procedures and crane control systems on all our Liebherr cranes, from our 30 tonne model to the large 220 tonne machine, are identical. That means that we are extremely flexible when it comes to assigning operators to them. It also makes planning easier if somebody is ill”, explains Kücükdag.. The highlight of the fleet is an LTM 1025 built in 1991An LTM 1025, which the company regards jealously, is almost 30 years old. Kücükdag bought the 25 tonne crane second-hand in 1995. He says: “It was the first crane we had with a LICCON controller and is still worth its weight in gold to us because it is very compact, and thanks to its split superstructure cab, it can be driven through gaps with a clearance height of 2.95 metres. Its Niveaumatik hydro-pneumatic axle suspension and two steered axles mean it also has up to date chassis technology.”Kücükdag also has plenty of praise for the reliability of the vintage crane: “We have had very few technical problems since we have had it and we have only needed to replace wearing parts. And when it comes to service, nobody can hold a candle to Liebherr in Ehingen – if we place an order at 4 pm, the parts are with us by 9 am at the latest the next morning. Even for our 30 year old crane, the whole thing only takes two or three days.”. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

World premiere: Liebherr presents the new generation of articulated dump trucks,Press releases |10/30/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/world-premiere-liebherr-presents-the-new-generation-of-articulated-dump-trucks.html?page=81,"Yesterday evening Liebherr-Hydraulikbagger GmbH unveiled the first representative of the new generation of articulated dump trucks within the framework of a digital product presentation. The TA 230 Litronic has been redeveloped from scratch on the basis of comprehensive market and customer analyses, designed with state-of-the-art technical implements and tested to the limits in extensive test phases according to the highest quality standards. The result: An excellent product with a new design, which represents maximum quality and reliability, impresses in terms of performance and efficiency and at the same time provides the utmost comfort.Find out more",Press releases,10/30/2020,"With the introduction of the new generation of articulated dump trucks, Liebherr becomes a full-liner in the earthmoving area. Apart from a comprehensive product portfolio of earthmoving machines for diverse applications, a Liebherr dump truck is now available to customers with the new TA 230 Litronic.The extremely robust, powerful and all-terrain machine is primarily designed for overburden transport and the mining industry. The articulated dump trucks are also a useful assistant for larger infrastructure projects. Thanks to their optimal structure gauge, they can also be used for special applications, such as tunnel construction.. New machine concept: Maximum performance in challenging off-road applicationsThe new TA 230 Litronic convinces with a clever machine concept, which has been developed specially for challenging off-road applications. New designs in the front end area create maximum ground clearance for superb off-road performance. For example, in the TA 230 Litronic the powershift transmission is positioned safely and compactly under the operator's cab and the exhaust gas aftertreatment is safely installed behind the operator's cab in a space-saving manner, whereby a large slope angle could be generated.The newly designed, solid articulated swivel joint creates excellent off-road capability: It allows independent movements of front and rear end, thus ensuring maximum manoeuvrability. The robust and positive-locking swivel joint with tapered roller bearing is perfect for the shear stresses arising during use, withstands maximum loads and provides optimal force distribution.The front and rear axles of the machine are secured via sturdy A-rods at the articulated swivel joint and at the rear end. Also here the focus was on maximum ground clearance in the development: Both the front axle suspension with A-rods and shock absorbers at the articulated swivel joint and the position of the separate and oscillating A-rods of the rear axles at the rear end provide maximum ground clearance.Powerful drive with maximum traction: Superb driving performance and combined pulling force A powerful 6-cylinder construction machinery engine with 12 l displacement and 265 kW / 360 hp is installed in the new TA 230 Litronic, which complies with the requirements of exhaust emissions standard V. A robust and efficient drivetrain with automatic 8-speed powershift transmission ensures optimal force distribution. With the actively controlled longitudinal differential locks, automatic traction control is also available for the TA 230 Litronic: As soon as slip occurs at an axle, the torque is cleverly transferred to the axle or axles with traction. The new Liebherr dump truck impresses with an excellent driving performance and enormous pulling force, even in the most difficult ground conditions and on challenging gradients. Maximum safety is always guaranteed thanks to optimal adhesion.. Increased productivity: More material movement in a short time thanks to optimised troughThe large and robust trough of the new TA 230 Litronic is designed for the effective transport of a 28-tonne payload. Numerous improvements have been made for quick and efficient loading and unloading, as well as safe transport of the material. The front of the trough is straight and the sills are low so that loading with a wheel loader, for example, is easily possible across the entire length. A standard, innovative weighing system shows the current payload during the loading process on the display in the operator's cab. An optional loading light on both sides at the back of the operator's cab shows the loading level outdoors.In order to accelerate the release of the material during unloading, the inner edges of the new trough are tapered. Thanks to the optional trough heating with exhaust gas management, unloading can also be easily realised at cooler temperatures. The two tipping cylinders at the side give the TA 230 Litronic high tipping pressure. The load can be tipped against the slope easily and quickly. During transportation the long chute at the end of the trough ensures minimal material loss. The trough volume can be increased with the optional tailgate. Thanks to the large opening width, tipping of large and bulky transported material is easily possible. Even with the tailgate the overall width of the TA 230 Litronic is still below 3 m – this allows the machine to be easily and quickly transported on the low-loader.Newly developed operator's cab and lighting concept: Optimal visibility and safety The newly developed, spacious operator's cab of the TA 230 Litronic provides ideal conditions for comfortable and safe working. Thanks to the excellent panoramic windows without any annoying struts, as well as the short, inclined bonnet, the machine driver always has an optimal view of the driving, working and articulating area of the machine. A touch display with integrated rear camera also increases visibility in the rear area. In the soundproof cab ergonomically arranged control elements facilitate intuitive operation of the machine. Various trays and storage spaces greatly expand the spatial offering. The offset steps, as well as the large driver's door, also make possible convenient and safe access to the operator's cab.The new lighting concept with LED headlights ensures improved visibility and safety – both for the machine operator and everyone in the outdoor area. For example, dipped-beam headlamps with integrated high beam illuminate the road and the extra powerful, optional LED headlights on the front of the can illuminate the entire working area. The lighting at the rear of the trough and another light package at the mudguards light up the manoeuvring areas at night. The modern LED design light provides additional visibility of the Liebherr dump truck and thus increased safety on the construction site. The new Liebherr dump truck also has an optional LED access light which provides extra safety when getting into the operator's cab.. Modern assist systems and adaptive steering system increase comfort and safetyThe modern assist systems installed in the new TA 230 Litronic support the machine operator, thus increasing safety and comfort during operation. Apart from a hill start assist, a speed assist is also available. With the hard stop function, the end position damping of the trough lifting cylinders can be activated or deactivated at the touch of a button. The trough lift is limited for work in a height-critical area with the aid of the height limit.The speed-dependent steering provides additional driving comfort: The adaptive steering system continuously adapts the ratio of the steering movements to the current speed. This makes possible easy and accurate manoeuvring at low speeds, but also accurate steering at higher speeds, as well as fewer steering corrections when cornering or taking bends.Maintenance-friendly machine design With the intelligent machine check-up and a service-oriented machine design, the new TA 230 Litronic boasts an optimised maintenance concept. The Liebherr dump truck automatically performs the daily check itself thanks to the clever sensor technology: The machine runs through an inspection catalogue at the start, where levels of engine oil, coolant, the central lubrication system, for example, are checked for the nominal state. Any deviations are shown on the display in the operator's cab. As a result, the daily set-up times can be reduced, costs can be saved and the durability of the components can be extended.The electrohydraulic opening bonnet, as well as an integrated, folding ladder with non-slip steps, provide easy, safe and clear access to the entire engine compartment. All relevant service points are visible and easily accessible. Maintenance work can be performed comfortably and safely from a platform. Refuelling with fuel or urea solution is also done easily and safely from the ground.. Key performance data of the TA 230 Litronic in standard version at a glance:Empty vehicle weight: 24,600 kgPayload: 28,000 kg (metric tons)Max. trough capacity with tailgate: 18.1 m³Engine power (ISO 9249): 265 kW / 360 hpExhaust emissions standard VMax. driving speed: 57 km/h (forward) / 16 km/h (reverse).

Liebherr restores a 60-year-old wheel loader prototype: The LSL 1500,Press releases |10/27/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/liebherr-restores-a-60-year-old-wheel-loader-prototype-the-lsl-1500.html?page=82,"Almost 60 years after its début, Liebherr has restored one of the first wheel loader prototypes from the corporate group’s early years: the LSL 1500. This specimen is the oldest preserved Liebherr wheel loader in existence. Liebherr has invested about 650 working hours in the restoration of the vintage loader which is now used as an exhibition piece in the Liebherr Bischofshofen factory.Find out more",Press releases,10/27/2020,"“When developing wheel loaders, we deal with the latest technologies and trends on a daily basis. However, we also respect our roots. And this wheel loader here shows that Liebherr was getting innovative machine concepts off the ground even six decades ago,” explains Martin Gschwend, who is managing director of the Liebherr Bischofshofen plant and responsible for the worldwide distribution of Liebherr wheel loaders.At the Bischofshofen facility, he is inspecting a particular rarity: a Liebherr LSL 1500 wheel loader from the early 1960s. It is the only remaining example of a pilot series of only five machines and is the oldest preserved Liebherr wheel loader in existence. The wheel loader specialists in Bischofshofen have lovingly and fully restored this machine over recent months.. From scrap metal to an exhibition pieceThe wheel loader veteran has had a very full life. After a few years at a gravel factory in the Biberach area, the machine arrived at the Fried-Sped corporate group in Ummendorf circa 1980. The LSL 1500 served the logistics specialist reliably for around 20 years. At the beginning of the 2000s, with the shovel loader already around 40 years old, Liebherr took the prototype back and preserved the now decommissioned wheel loader.However, this storage location was not to be the final resting place for the historic wheel loader. In 2019, Liebherr-Werk Bischofshofen GmbH decided to fully restore this last remaining LSL 1500. The ravages of time, particularly in the form of rust and frost damage, had taken their toll on the machine.. The project began in the spring of 2020 at the Liebherr Bischofshofen plant. The wheel loader experts refurbished each individual part of the LSL 1500 down to the very last screw. For the team, the renovation meant much more than mere nostalgia: “Several apprentices worked on the restoration. For them, this was a rare opportunity to observe and understand the technology of earlier times,” explains Andreas Scharler, who ran the repair centre for many years.In many places, technical skill and improvisational talent were required. “When you start the diesel engine, the operating voltage suddenly switches from 12 to 24 volts. We first had to analyse this process correctly in order to be able to start the wheel loader successfully. It was a splendid moment when we heard the powerful six-cylinder diesel engine running for the first time,” says Scharler, who, with his team, invested about 650 working hours in this vintage wheel loader.. A piece of wheel loader historyIn the 1950s, Liebherr was already experimenting with wheel loaders, a type of machine still in its infancy and underdeveloped at the time. Liebherr’s first two prototypes, the “Elephant” and “Mammoth” models, still had to cope with increased tyre wear and modest traction.In the early 1960s, Liebherr then managed to create a reliable wheel loader prototype with the LSL 1500, weighing around ten tonnes and with 108 hp. Leibherr produced a pilot series of five units. The LSL 1500 had a rigid frame and hydraulically supported rear wheel steering which was luxurious for the time. The load transmission was achieved by a torque converter and a four-wheel drive, which could optionally be switched off.The new kinematics provided a dumping height of around three metres and allowed for the loading of construction site vehicles with larger side heights. For poor weather, an all-weather cover with sewn-in transparent windows and heating was available for the operator’s platform, which was still open at that time. With pride, Liebherr described its LSL 1500 in a data sheet as a “new design based on many years of experience in the construction of earth-moving machines”.You can find further information on the restoration of the Liebherr shovel loader LSL 1500 at www.liebherr.com/lsl-1500..

One hoist instead of three – new boom system on the LR 11000 delivers greater efficiency,Press releases |10/27/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/one-hoist-instead-of-three-new-boom-system-on-the-lr-11000-delivers-greater-efficiency.html?page=82,"The Nordex Delta 4000 wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 149 metres is the latest generation onshore system in the four to five megawatts power class. In the past, three hoists were required to install the generator at its hub height of 108 metres – the nacelle, drivetrain and hub were hoisted separately and assembled at the top of the tower. American crane specialist Buckner Heavy Lift Cranes has now demonstrated that the work can be carried out more quickly, more easily and more economically – with one hoist rather than three.Find out more",Press releases,10/27/2020,"The whole thing is made possible by the new, more powerful SL8F2 boom system, which Liebherr has developed in collaboration with Buckner for the LR 11000 crawler crane. This system is so powerful that it can hoist the completely assembled generator – the eighth version of the SL boom with the second version of the fixed F jib delivers a lifting capacity of 253 tonnes with a hook height of 114 metres, enough to hoist the 230 tonnes made up of the complete generator and load handling equipment up to the hub height of 108 metres. Another advantage is that assembling the nacelle with the drivetrain and hub on the ground is easier and safer than at high altitude.The configuration of the LR 11000 with SL8F2 for modern wind turbines on towers around 100 metres high is particularly economical because the crane can operate without a derrick system. This saves crane contractors logistics work and set-up time because fewer parts have to be transported and erected.Buckner completed the first Nordex Delta 4000 generator to be installed with a single hoist at a wind farm in Northern Oklahoma in the centre of the United States. The LR 11000 was set up with the 108 metre SL boom and 12 metre fixed jib. 130 tonnes of central ballast, 250 tonnes of slewing platform ballast and a further 80 tonnes on the slewing platform extension provided the required stability to hoist the gross load of 230 tonnes to a hook height of 114 metres. This successful premiere will mean that this assembly process will now become standard procedure for this particular wind turbine. Five of 17 LR 11000 cranes, which Buckner is now operating in the USA, feature this new boom system.. Daniel Ives, Engineering Product Support & Analyst at Buckner, explains: “As we are convinced by the performance of the new SL8F2 system, we suggested to our customer, Wanzek Construction, Inc, and the owner of the wind farm, Duke Energy Corporation, that we should attempt to install the complete generator in a single hoist. As a result of the possible cost savings and the reduced risk posed by wind and weather, Nordex was then also quickly convinced to develop the load handling equipment for the job.”Buckner used several Liebherr cranes for this wind farm project. LTR 1220 telescopic crawler cranes were responsible for unloading the components and assembling the nacelle, drivetrain and hub on the ground. Liebherr LR 1500 crawler cranes installed the bottom sections of the towers using a main boom system and were then converted to a luffing boom system to assist with the installation of the rotor blades. Two LR 11000 cranes installed the top tower sections and the generators.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Family outing: Four Liebherr K series cranes support bridge construction project,Press releases |10/22/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/family-outing-four-liebherr-k-series-cranes-support-bridge-construction-project.html?page=82,Great teamwork by four Liebherr K series tower cranes in the centre of the Emsland region in North West Germany: two 81 K.1 and two 53 K cranes are currently being used for concrete work and formwork transport purposes during the construction of a bridge measuring over 200 metres in length.Find out more,Press releases,10/22/2020,"To facilitate management of a floodplain in the Emsland region for the next 100 years, a replacement of the Versen floodplain bridge is under way in Meppen. The 85 bored piles, which are more than 20 metres in length, are already in place. The bridge requires a total of 5,000 cubic metres of concrete and more than 700 tonnes of steel – all will be lifted by the four Liebherr tower cranes. The heaviest parts, formwork tables with infill zones, weigh between 2.2 and 3.1 tonnes. Overlapping operating areas have been created through the insertion of tower sections to ensure that all loads can be handled without the help of mobile cranes.The Versen floodplain bridge is 211 metres in length and is therefore the second longest in the Emsland region, only beaten by a bridge in Rhede (Ems). As the entire length of the bridge requires optimal coverage, the crane company Maschinen- & Anlagen– Reparatur- & Montage GmbH, MARM for short, selected four Liebherr tower cranes: the two 81 K.1 are operating with a 48-metre radius and a hook height of 29 metres, the two 53 K with a 40-metre radius and a hook height of 23.8 metres. Alongside their reach, it was the high handling capacity of the cranes, a result of Liebherr’s in-house produced drives, that proved to be a decisive factor for this choice.. Peter Herbers, managing director of the Meppen-based building contractor working on the 6.5 million euro project, and Bernhard Hackmann, the project manager responsible for the Emsland district, are in agreement; so far, everything is going according to plan. “The project will be completed before the end of 2020, half a year ahead of schedule,” reports Herbers. He sees the fast disassembly of the K series cranes as a particular advantage, “On two occasions, the cranes have had to be dismantled and removed from flooded areas virtually overnight.”As the construction of the floodplain bridge enters its final stages, the next assignment already awaits; the realisation of the longest bridge in the Emsland region, the River Ems and floodplain bridge in Rhede (Ems), which will measure approx. 300 metres. For the completion of this new replacement construction, the family-owned company will again be relying on the crane experts and solutions of Liebherr and its local dealer, MARM GmbH, in Lingen..

Closing the gap – Schlamann takes delivery of Liebherr LTM 1060-3.1 mobile crane,Press releases |10/22/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/closing-the-gap-schlamann-takes-delivery-of-liebherr-ltm-1060-3-1-mobile-crane.html?page=82,Schlamann-Autokrane GmbH has taken delivery of a new Liebherr LTM 1060-3.1 mobile crane. The northern German crane contractor based at Marklohe near Nienburg will use the 60 tonne crane to replace an LTM 1045-3.1 and upgrade its fleet in the class between 50 and 90 tonnes.Find out more,Press releases,10/22/2020,"Managing Director Torsten Schlamann travelled to the Liebherr production plant in Ehingen with authorised signatory Jessica Schomburg for the handover of the new crane. He commented: “The LTM 1060-3.1 is exactly what our crane fleet was missing. It is a compact, powerful 3-axle crane with a very long telescopic boom. Its good off-road features mean that it will be a perfect supplement to our LTF 1060-4.1 telescopic truck-mounted cranes, particularly for construction projects”.The LTM 1060-3.1 has a 48 metre telescopic boom and can reach hook heights of up to 63 metres using a folding jib. It can carry up to 5.5 tonnes of ballast on the road, which means it can tackle a whole host of crane jobs without requiring additional transport vehicles. A special method of dividing the ballast slabs has been included in the design of this mobile crane. This means that a wide range of driving configurations can be achieved quickly and easily. Its compact dimensions and time-tested ECOmode and ECOdrive make this mobile crane particularly economical to use.Schlamann now has 21 mobile cranes, all of them supplied by Liebherr. “Liebherr is a reliable partner and the cranes hold their value extremely well. Their service is excellent. That is why we only have Liebherr cranes in our fleet. We have also ordered the new LTM 1110-5.1, which will be delivered next spring”, says Torsten Schlamann. In addition to mobile cranes, the company also rents around 190 work platforms and has a 70-strong workforce.. DownloadsHere you will find the press release and images for download..

Increased hoist height and radius – Liebherr unveils a jewel for any crane fleet with the LTM 1150-5.3,Press releases |10/20/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/increased-hoist-height-and-radius-liebherr-unveils-a-jewel-for-any-crane-fleet-with-the-ltm-1150-5-3.html?page=82,"After manufacturing around 1500 units, Liebherr has now unveiled the successor to its successful LTM 1130-5.1 – the LTM 1150-5.3. With a maximum lifting capacity of 150 tonnes and a 66 metre telescopic boom, it is also the perfect addition to Liebherr’s crane range below the 180 tonne LTM 1160-5.2. The 10 percent longer telescopic boom compared to its predecessor will hoist on average 15 percent higher loads with both maximum and part ballast. And with this in mind, the Liebherr engineers have produced a minor miracle – the new crane has the same low gross weight as its predecessor. With an axle load of twelve tonnes, the crane can carry nine tonnes of ballast on public roads.Find out more",Press releases,10/20/2020,"After the LTM 1120-4.1 in March, Liebherr has now unveiled the second new development in its all-terrain crane range this year – the LTM 1150-5.3 or “The jewel in your fleet”. Christoph Kleiner, Sales Director, explains the slogan: “A flexible all-rounder, the LTM 1150-5.3 will enhance any crane fleet like a jewel – It has the longest boom in this crane class at 66 metres and can compete with crane models in the 200 tonne lifting capacity class. It delivers outstanding lifting capacities when fully raised and at large radii. And it is immediately ready for use once it reaches the site. This is because the new 150 tonne crane carries nine tonnes of a ballast with a gross weight of 60 tonnes. That means it can complete lots of jobs without requiring additional ballast transport vehicles. That saves time and money, and makes the crane even more valuable to crane contractors – hence our slogan: “The jewel for your crane fleet”.Long, powerful telescopic boomCompared to its predecessor, the telescopic boom on the new LTM 1150-5.3 is six metres longer. At the same length of 60 metres, the new 5-axle crane can hoist 12 tonnes when fully raised – 1.5 tonnes more than its predecessor. When fully extended to 66 metres, the new crane has a lifting capacity of over 9 tonnes. That makes it perfect for erecting tower cranes and radio masts.Lattice extensions enables the new 150-tonne crane to achieve hook heights of up to 92 metres and radii of up to 72 metres. For this, one 7 metre lattice section as boom extension and a 10.8 to 19 metre double folding jib are used. The latter can be adjusted hydraulically between 0° and 40°. A 2.9 metre erection jib and a runner, which can be swung to the side, round off the equipment list. Particularly economical – the lattice jibs are compatible for many crane models in the 100 to 180 tonne class within the Liebherr portfolio.Economical drive technology with ECOdrive and ECOmodeThe time-tested six-cylinder Liebherr diesel engine in the undercarriage provides all the drive power the LTM 1150-5.3 needs. It develops 400 kW / 544 bhp and a torque of a 2516 Nm. The engine satisfies the new stage V emissions directive and can also be configured to comply with the regulations which apply in countries outside of Europe, for example Tier 4 for the USA or stage IIIA for low regulated countries.The ZF-TraXon gearbox is used to transfer the power to the crane's axles. ECOdrive is particularly economical and convenient – the additional eco mode delivers enhanced drive properties which save fuel and reduce both noise and CO2 emissions. In addition, Hillstart Aid makes starting on gradients easier.Liebherr has continued its single-engine strategy on this crane with a mechanical drive unit for the superstructure. The weight reduction created by the elimination of the superstructure engine from the previous model is used to deliver a longer boom and more lifting capacity.In keeping with the latest developments from the Liebherr mobile crane series, the new 150 tonne crane also features ECOmode for crane operations to reduce fuel consumption and emissions of both noise and CO2. Firstly, the complete pump drive can be disconnected automatically when the engine is idling and then reconnected by the intelligent controller in a matter of seconds when it is required. And secondly, the crane controller automatically calculates the perfect engine speed for the working speed selected using the control lever to avoid unnecessarily high engine speeds.For the first time on telescopic cranes – adjustable hook blocksHook blocks have to be heavy to ensure that the hoisting winch spools reliably. However, they should be as light as possible for being transported on the crane and for high net loads during hoists. Liebherr has designed a completely new range of hook blocks to satisfy these contradictory requirements – weight plates are attached to both sides of the hook block to change the weight of the block so that it is perfect for the current situation. Christoph Kleiner explains: “Our engineers have produced a simple, but brilliant design as it means that operators can react even more flexibly to every job.”For example, a 3-roller hook block, which previously has weighed 700 kg in this crane class, now only weighs 500 kg, but can be upgraded to 700 kg quickly and easily when necessary. The new system is available for 1 to 7-roller hook blocks. These can be used on cranes with both 19 mm and 21 mm ropes. The weights can be interchanged to ensure simple handling..

Mammoet takes delivery of first ever Liebherr LTM 1650- 8.1 mobile crane,Press releases |10/19/2020,https://www.liebherr.com/en/usa/latest-news/news-press-releases/detail/mammoet-takes-delivery-of-first-ever-liebherr-ltm-1650-8.1-mobile-crane.html?page=82,"The first ever LTM 1650-8.1 left the Liebherr plant in Ehingen with a black and red livery. It is going to Dutch global crane and heavy haulage contractor, Mammoet.Find out more",Press releases,10/19/2020,"“We are delighted to take delivery of the first ever LTM 1650-8.1 from Liebherr. The performance, mobility and economy of this new crane model will enrich our fleet, giving Mammoet the flexibility to gradually replace our 500 and 700-tonners with this new Liebherr 8-axle crane. The crane handover is also a sign of the strong, long term relationship between our two companies, which are leaders in their respective industries”, explained COO Jan Kleijn.Christoph Kleiner, Managing Director Sales at Liebherr in Ehingen, thanked Mammoet for its order for several LTM 1650-8.1 cranes: “Thank you very much for the trust you have shown in us, confirming that, in the form of the LTM 1650-8.1, we have designed a worthy successor to the LTM 1500-8.1. We also appreciate feedback from crane operations and the advice that we received from Mammoet to enable us to extract the maximum from eight axles. Close collaboration with our customers in our product development process is extremely important to us.”Liebherr has retained the successful concept of the previous LTM 1500-8.1 – the new LTM 1650-8.1 can also be supplied with two telescopic boom lengths, 54 metres and 80 metres. In pursuing the company’s focus on producing the ultimate crane on eight axles, the increases in lifting capacity are impressive – between 15 and 50 percent depending on whether the crane has telescopic boom guying or not. The standard VarioBase® variable support base delivers additional increases in performance when working above the outriggers. This means the new crane will be able to complete hoisting work normally reserved for the 700-tonne class or even higher with ease. It actually has a nominal lifting capacity of 700 tonnes.“Whilst our original desire was to gradually replace our LTM 1500-8.1 cranes, we are delighted that Liebherr has managed to extract so much performance from the LTM 1650-8.1 that we can also use it to replace 700 tonne class machines. The main highlights of the new crane include the simple, fast setup and dismantling of the rear support box. It also has standard ballast slabs, which are compatible with other Liebherr cranes, ranging from 350 to 1,200 tonne models. That increases the flexibility of our fleet and is extremely cost-efficient”, explained Peter van Oostrom, Director Global Projects and Assets at Mammoet.Mammoet Holding B.V. has branches all over the world and is a highly specialist company for a very wide range of crane and transport work, offshore work, complete erection work and turnkey projects. It has a 7,100-strong workforce and operates more than 1,300 cranes of the most diverse types, including around 500 Liebherr mobile and crawler cranes..

The Liebherr 9-axle crane is now supplied as standard with new lifting capacity values which upgrade the crane almost throughout its entire operating range. The performance of the LTM 1750-9.1 has been significantly upgraded particularly for wind power jobs.Find out more,Press releases,10/15/2020,"The new crane was driven from the Liebherr manufacturing plant in Ehingen straight to a wind farm in Austria where it erected the lower tower segments for 10 wind turbines. The upper segments, gondola and rotor were then installed by a large lattice boom crane.“Customer requirements relating to lifting capacity and height are on the rise. That is why we decided to buy the LTM 1750- 9.1. The 800 tonne upgrade was a major factor behind our purchase decision because it means we are well set for the future”, explained the two Managing Directors, Hagen and Björn Sommer.Four years ago, they took over the management of the family-run company, since when they have significantly increased the size and capacity of its crane fleet. At that time, the company had 15 cranes with a maximum lifting capacity of 400 tonnes, but today it has 20 cranes with lifting capacities of up to 800 tonnes. Hagen Sommer commented: “We think it is important to provide our customers with new cranes featuring the latest technology. That is why we replace our cranes every four to five years.”Although the coronavirus pandemic has affected the business, it has not stopped the Sommers from investing in the future. A few months ago, the company took delivery of an LTM 1450-8.1 and LTM 1230-5.1 from Liebherr.“Liebherr is a strong partner for us.
