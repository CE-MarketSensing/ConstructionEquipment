30 May 2023,World’s top ten construction OEMs revealed,"The latest Yellow Table, International Construction’s annual ranking of the world’s top 50 construction equipment manufacturers by sales figures, has revealed that sales for 2022 were US$230.6 billion, one of the highest figures ever recorded in the listing.
A large reason for this growth is the performance of manufacturers based in the US. OEMs based in the US accounted for over 26% of the total revenue of the Yellow Table, up from 21% in the last listing.
You can view the full Yellow Table in the latest issue of International Construction magazine with in-depth analysis.
The top ten biggest construction equipment manufacturers in the world for 2022 were:
10. JCB, UK
JCB enters the top ten for the first time in several years, with strong sales in the OEMs main market of India boosting its bottom line. The OEM is investing heavily into hydrogen technology.
9. Sandvik, Sweden
Another rise up the table for Sandvik – the company was at number ten last year. The company has been making numerous acquisitions, with the OEM making ten acquisitions in 2022, helping to explain their increased ranking.
8. Hitachi, Japan
Hitachi had construction equipment sales of US$9.2 billion, a steady increase from its final results last year. In 2022 the brand saw the ending of its joint venture with John Deere, with Hitachi Chairman Sonny Ishii saying at ConExpo that, “The Americas market is the single most important market, or priority, for Hitachi Construction Machinery.”
7. Liebherr, Germany
Liebherr saw good growth in 2022. In its own report it said that its construction and mining segments – earthmoving, material handling technology, deep foundation machines, mobile and crawler cranes, tower cranes, concrete technology and mining equipment – had an average increase in turnover of 6.9%. Liebherr says it is taking a technology-neutral approach to its research, which includes the increased use of hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVO), for potential use in construction equipment.
6.Volvo Construction Equipment
When adjusted for currency changes, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) had sales of US$9.9 billion keeping it in sixth place. The company is one of the leading OEMs when it comes to electric construction equipment, with one of the largest commercially available ranges including its new 23 ton battery electric excavator.
5. Sany, China
China-based Sany drop down one place in the table, from number four to number five. The Chinese construction market faced challenges in 2022 following on from two strong years so a general drop in China-based OEMs on the table was expected.
4. John Deere, US
US-based John Deere increased its ranking on the Yellow Table by one place, as it did in the previous Table. The company’s purchase of the Wirtgen Group has been a success and provided the company with access to new markets.
3. XCMG, China
Despite seeing sales fall, XCMG remains the world’s third largest OEM. As is the case with all major Chinese OEMs, the company is actively looking to increase its share of the international market and its most recent results showed record overseas sales. One of their leading executives believes that there is more growth to come in these markets.
2. Komatsu, Japan
Komatsu remains at number two on the list and has extended the gap between it and the rest of the table with sales that, when adjusted for currency, were similar to the last Yellow Table. The OEM recently announced the development of a medium-sized hydraulic excavator concept, powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The manufacturer said the machine’s development is in line with its aim to achieve carbon neutrality in construction equipment.
1. Caterpillar, US
Caterpillar retains its traditional position as the world’s biggest construction manufacturer with sales with sales of US$37.5 billion – approximately 16% of the total of the whole table. A senior executive at the OEM recently told International Construction about the OEMs plans regarding sustainability and new technology.

26 May 2023,Heavy wheeled loaders: The workhorse of the construction site,"Heavy wheeled loaders have a home in almost every construction site and operators are spoilt for choice with the innovative machines manufacturers are releasing.
Komatsu Europe displayed the new WA800-8 wheeled loader at the demo ground at Bauma Munich in October 2022. The loader is said to have been designed for maximum operating comfort in addition to featuring a modulation clutch, variable traction control, an auto kick down and an RPM set.
The Japan-based company has also redesigned the machine’s extra-large 11.5m³ bucket, complete with its optimised maximum fill feature.
With a total operating weight of 115 tonnes, the WA800-8 meets the latest EU stage V emission regulations with a Komatsu-designed, developed and manufactured engine and after-treatment system.
“Our WA800 has always been well-appreciated for its reliability and productivity”, says Jo Monsieur, group manager for large machines at Komatsu Europe.
“And this latest generation surely continues this legacy. Furthermore, Komatsu has really set new standards for stability, comfort and safety and we are very proud to be able to offer this to our customers.”
Liebherr’s XPower wheeled loaders have established themselves at the forefront of fuel efficiency and robustness.
Liebherr says one reason is their power-split travel drive, installed as standard in all Liebherr XPower wheeled loaders. The combination of hydrostatic drive – advantageous for material uptake and travelling over short distances – and mechanical drive ensure that the machine works at maximum efficiency.
In addition to the two drive types, Liebherr offers a range of intelligent assistance systems for its mid-size and XPower wheeled loaders, including active personnel detection with brake assistance. The optional assistance system warns the machine operator of hazards in the rear area of the machine. Sensors and artificial intelligence combine to distinguish between people and objects for additional safety. As soon as the sensors detect a source of danger, the brake assistant automatically decelerates the wheel loader‘s speed. This shortens the stopping distance by multiple feet, reducing the frequency and intensity of potential accidents.
In Denmark, 40 Liebherr XPower wheel loaders are being used for material handling at RGS Nordic – which specialises in recycling construction and demolition waste materials.
Michael Jørgensen, strategic purchasing manager, commented, “The Liebherr wheel loaders need less fuel, are powerful and have hardly any downtime. We are particularly impressed that we achieve 30% more productivity with the same fuel consumption than with comparable wheel loaders in this size class.”
RGS Nordic was in the market for efficient wheel loaders with power-split drive to reduce CO2 emissions. With the company’s main focus on converting construction waste into reusable and circular products that can be integrated into the product cycle, it was important for the machinery used to reflect the same values.
Develon, formerly known as Doosan Construction Equipment, now offers the company’s latest generation ‘DL-7’ wheel loader range driven by new Stage V compliant engines and providing higher productivity, increased fuel efficiency and a low cost of ownership, coupled with a new cab offering an enhanced experience for the operator.
The four biggest standard models in the DL-7 range are the DL420-7, DL480-7, DL550-7 and DL580-7. The machines feature redesigned buckets offering up to 7% more capacity with maximum bucket capacities from 4.5 to 6.4 m3. Develon says that this provides increased productivity for a wide range of material-handling applications.
In addition to the company’s wheel loader range, Develon has introduced the ‘world’s first “transparent bucket” system’ for wheel loaders. The system is said to enable the wheel loader driver to see the blind spots in front of the machine’s bucket, using a monitor installed in the cab. By recording images with top and bottom front-loaded cameras and projecting the combined images in real-time using a curved projection method, the transparent bucket system provides a full view for the driver.
Develon says that the transparent bucket system addresses the issue of safety concerns caused by blind spots in front of wheel loaders due to their buckets. With this new feature, drivers can now easily check blind spots in front of the bucket via the cab monitor, increasing safety and reducing accidents.
Moreover, the transparent bucket system is said to enhance work efficiency by providing a forward view for the driver during loading, unloading, or carrying materials like aggregates, sand, and soil.
The company has applied for patents in Korea, North America, Europe, and China, making it the first company to develop and implement a front projection function with a transparent bucket for construction machinery.
A Develon spokesperson stated that advanced safety systems have become crucial in equipment selection with increasing safety standards. The company plans to continue developing safety features that prioritise driver and worker safety, aiming to lead the industry towards safer and accident-free construction sites.
Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has taken a major step forward in advancing its electromobility offerings with a new solution.
The company has converted its L120 wheel loader into an electric version, catering to the increasing demand for sustainable solutions in the mid-size range. The conversion was done in collaboration with partners Parker Hannifin and CE Engineering Solutions, a Volvo Group subsidiary.
The L120H Electric Conversion, available to selected customers in Europe from 2023, will provide the same performance as the conventional machine while emitting zero emissions.
Volvo CE says that it is committed to achieving a carbon-neutral construction industry and has partnered with CE Engineering Solutions and other electromobility partners to accelerate the availability of commercialised electric solutions across all segments and applications. This collaboration is part of the company’s efforts to expand its line of electric wheel loaders, following its investment in Dutch manufacturer Limach in June to broaden its electric excavator portfolio.
The L120H Electric Conversion is expected to provide numerous benefits to the construction industry, including reduced noise pollution, lower operating costs, and increased productivity. The machine’s electric powertrain also offers instant torque, making it more responsive and efficient than traditional combustion engines.
In addition, the electric version is designed to require less maintenance than its diesel counterpart, reducing downtime and increasing overall equipment availability.
Powered by 240 kWh batteries, the L120H provides a runtime of approximately five hours in most medium-duty applications. Consistent with Volvo’s existing charging solutions, it is estimated to charge from 0-100% in just 1.5-2 hours.
Carl Slotte, head of sales region Europe at Volvo CE, says, “There is no time to wait – we need to deliver solutions that allow our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Change starts here.
“Our commitment to partnership allows us to take a leading position in transforming our industry, with electric solutions that are built to fulfil market demand and tailored to suit the changing needs of our customers. Working together, we are scaling up our portfolio of electric machines, extending the versatility of our range and transforming our industry towards a carbon-neutral future.”
Depending on market demand, Volvo CE says there could be the possibility to convert existing users’ L120H wheel loaders to electric in the future.
Beyond sustainability, Volvo CE is significantly developing the safety systems that are available on their wheeled loaders.
Volvo CE has launched its Collision Mitigation System for Volvo Wheel Loaders, which aims to support operator response and reduce the risk of collision when working in reverse. The feature automatically applies the service brakes when the wheel loader approaches an obstacle, helping to mitigate the consequences of accidents and reduce the risk of unplanned interruptions.
The system is designed to facilitate job site safety and remembers the last slope the machine climbed for seamless stockpiling operations. Volvo CE says that it can be temporarily deactivated for specific site conditions and only functions when the wheel loader is in reverse and driving between 3-15 km/h. The Collision Mitigation System is a factory-fit option for a range of Volvo wheel loaders and is available globally.
Lars Eriksson, global product manager for wheel loaders at Volvo CE says, “We at Volvo CE continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions which not only mitigate the consequences of accidents but strive to avoid them altogether.
“This new Collision Mitigation System is one important part of our work to reduce the risk of accidents and help fulfil our commitment towards zero accidents.”
Volvo CE has developed the Collision Mitigation System in-house for its line of wheel loaders. This factory-fit option is currently offered on the L110H/L120H equipped with OptiShift, L150H, L180H, L220H, L260H, and L200H High-Lift wheel loaders.
To function, it requires a Radar Detect System to be installed, adding to the existing range of features, options, and site services designed by Volvo CE to promote job site safety and reduce unforeseen interruptions.
The heavy wheeled loader market is certainly busy. Enhancements are being made left, right and centre with almost a solution for everything. As always, it is an exciting time in equipment development and the year is sure to bring about more innovations."
09 May 2023,Is construction losing out on efficiency gains by using too many tower cranes?,"


A city skyline bristling with tower cranes is normally taken as a good omen in the world of construction.

It suggests strong client demand and bulging order books as contractors work to fulfil tenders.

Some consultancies and planning firms even publish tower crane indices that judge the health of a region’s construction market by how many cranes stand above its cities.

But what if having so many hooks hanging above a site is actually a sign that a construction site could be operating more efficiently and more profitably?

Construction methods are modernising gradually as prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC) and other offsite manufacturing techniques gain in popularity.

Progress is uneven across the world, however, with some markets like Australia, Singapore, and the Middle East taking a lead while others adopt a more conservative approach.

Prefabricating larger, heavier building elements requires bigger, more powerful cranes to lift them.

Crane manufacturers have started to cater to that demand (see below).

Whereas five years ago a mainstream manufacturer’s range might have topped out with a 32t tower crane, that has now extended to 50t or even 64t.

There’s also a trend towards a flat top design for faster setup times and a lower overall height. It’s also easier to change job and counterjib lengths on a flat top crane.


“Over the past 20 years, we have been continually upsizing the cranes in Australia as the construction methodology changes,” says Simon Marr, director at Australian crane specialist Marr Contracting.

While countries like his own have embraced PPVC and the larger cranes that go with it, others are still catching up. And Marr can see a missed opportunity for greater efficiency, speed and ultimately profit that contractors are currently losing out on.

During a visit to London, where Marr Contracting has an office, he explains that the approach in the UK and other parts of Europe is still much more traditional. “Here, it’s very much still about lifting 2t beams and that seems to be a really inefficient way to build,” he says.

“Whereas, we have a job back home at the moment on a structural steel building where we are lifting trusses of 120t. Why are we doing that? We are trying to take the risk out of the project.

“You see a lot of jobs where there are just way too many cranes. They can’t work because they are falling over each other. They are slow and costly because you need more labour, more engineering and more temporary works on your structure.”

Marr argues that prefabrication enables contractors to use fewer, bigger cranes to lift larger, prefabricated building elements that have been assembled on the ground under conditions that are safer for workers.

“Often, clients will say to us: ‘But we need more hooks on the job.’ But often you don’t need more hooks – you need to understand what you are lifting and what you really need to do is reduce the number of lifts on the job. And you do that by making the pieces bigger,” says Marr.


Marr attributes a reluctance in some markets to considering using a single larger crane coupled with modern methods of construction to a fear of change.

But he is seeing a gradual shift in attitudes. “We look at it and think there is an opportunity you are leaving behind here. There is a better way to build and more margin in it for you if you want to adopt a different method.

“But you have got to be brave and take the first step towards a different way of constructing,” he says.

As the methods change, the challenge becomes how to get material to the crane quickly enough because its lifting efficiency has improved, he adds. And he asserts that larger cranes with high-capacity, high-speed lifting “blow the smaller fleet out of the water” in terms of how much material they can move onto a project.

But he also stresses the need for early engagement with clients – as was the case on the Çanakkale 1915 suspension bridge in Turkey, which saw Marr Contracting’s cranes lifting loads of around 160t up to a height of 300m. “That was really about early engagement with the client and completely turning upside down their construction methodology,” he says.

“By modularising all of your components offsite, you have better control of your tolerances and we can bring the modules in and lift them up in big chunks.”

The bridge finished nearly two years ahead of schedule.


One manufacturer that has taken note of growing demand for larger cranes is Liebherr.

“We see a trend for larger and heavier prefabricated parts, with the aim of shortening construction times,” a spokesperson for the company says.

“Construction with prefabricated parts varies from country to country. This is one of the reasons why Liebherr introduced new series-produced larger cranes for its successful series last year.”

Those cranes include the new 1188 EC-H 40 Fibre, with a maximum lifting capacity of 40t, which has been designed to move heavy precast parts into position. The crane, which is Liebherr’s strongest series-production crane lifts up to 13.1t at the top and has a maximum reach of 90m.

Meanwhile it has extended its EC-B series updates with the 520 EC-B 20 Fibre and 470 EC-B 20. The flat top cranes offer a maximum load capacity of up to 20t.

Spain-based tower crane manufacturer Jaso has also seen an upswing in demand for larger machines.

Theodor Peter Huitema, area manager for Jaso, says, “The growing trend towards PPVC, particularly in Asia, has led to increased requests for cranes with heavy duty lifting capacities.

“As a response to this demand, Jaso designed the J1400; it has an 80m-long jib and can lift a maximum load of 64t and 10.5t at tip load. The first four units of this model have been purchased by Singapore-headquartered Crane World Asia.”
Jaso’s second biggest unit from its range is the J800.48, which has 80m reach and a maximum load of 48t.
Huitema says the demand for large tower cranes for PPVC projects extends beyond just Singapore. The company is also working on projects in Australia, Hong Kong and the USA and markets like Sweden and the Netherlands also make use of large cranes to lift heavy pre-fab units. On a smaller scale, he notes, there are also pre-fab and pre-fabricated bathroom unit (PBU) projects in Chile and Spain, driving demand for cranes in the 500-700tnm class.
“This trend is set to grow because of an increasing lack of labour and more building with prefabricated modules,” he adds.

05 April 2023,Greening the grey: How are new concrete technologies tackling decarbonisation?,"Construction relies heavily on concrete as a building material; it is one of the most widely used resources around the world. The industry consumes about 4 billion tonnes globally every year and emits almost 2.5 billion tons of CO2 emissions. A versatile material, concrete can be used in foundations, roofing, walls, floors, cladding, and infrastructure such as bridges, dams, and more, due to its adaptability.
With its versatility, the industry has begun to ask for sustainable alternatives and ways to streamline the way that concrete is used.
France-based civil engineering company Eiffage has developed a plant-based asphalt composed of a bio-sourced binder (derived from by-products of the forestry and paper industry) and recycled road-surfacing materials. This mix is said to significantly reduce CO2 emissions linked to road construction activities.
Other companies, such as Liebherr, are focusing on modular concepts to help streamline concrete projects. The new Betomix and Mobilmix mixing plant series can be flexibly combined using prefabricated modules and replace several predecessor series.
For the user, Liebherr says that this means: more freedom when configuring the plants, shorter delivery times, faster assembly and increased parts availability. Improvements to the drive are also said to reduce current consumption by up to 30% and increase weighing accuracy, so that up to 7.5kg of cement can be saved per cubic metre of concrete.
Another area that has seen improvement recently is concrete milling, the removal of concrete. Concrete milling is already an established technology on projects around the globe and, thanks to technological advances, almost all hardnesses and grades of concrete pavement can be cost-efficiently removed. One of the largest concrete removal operations took place recently at Leipzig/Halle Airport in Germany with 15 Wirtgen cold milling machines used.
The first phase of the project involved the removal of the concrete from the north runway and the associated taxiways within 30 days. The resurfacing could only begin after the completion of this first phase. Around 350,000 tonnes of extremely hard concrete reinforced with steel rebar mats had to be removed by this cutting method – a battle against time and tonnage.
Specially modified cold milling machines and years of systematic development in the field of expendable cutting tools guarantee high productivity and efficiency when milling in hard concrete. The removal of reinforced concrete pavements containing tie-bars, dowels and rebar mats is also possible. Selective removal also enables the separation of concrete layers with different properties and the reduction of contaminated material.
The method offers further benefits in terms of environmental protection: As a rule, milled concrete can be recycled without any further treatment. The vibration-free procedure is characterised by low noise and low dust emissions.
“In contrast to milling in asphalt, the enormous hardness of the concrete here meant that we had to take slower milling speeds into account. The wear on the milling tools was also significantly higher. In spite of this, our previous experience from similar projects enabled us to continuously optimise the process,” said project manager Bernhard Fischer.
On display at this year’s ConExpo in Las Vegas, US, Astec’s SB-3000 Shuttle Buggy MTV looks to streamline the loading and unloading of materials onsite. The Roadtec SB-3000 material transfer vehicle stores and transfers hot-mixed asphalt material from truck to paver for non-stop paving. The anti-segregation auger is said to remix material just before delivery to the paver and the 31.7 metric ton (35 ton) storage capacity allows trucks to unload immediately.
Astec says that the SB-3000 design is focused on safety, comfort and productivity to ensure that it is easier for users to operate and safer to transport.
Also, on display was GOMACO’s GP460 placer/spreader slipform paver – the machine was actually making its world debut at ConExpo. As a placer/spreader with a 60 inch (1524mm) belt, the GP460 will accommodate widths up to 50 feet (15.2m) wide. As a concrete slipform paver, the GP460 will pave widths up to 40 feet (12.2m) wide.
It is said to be built on the framework of the GOMACO two-track GP4 slipform paver with the ability to convert the prime mover into a concrete placer/spreader. The prime mover is equipped with vibrator circuits for paving and auger drive circuits for placing.
Controlling the new technology is made possible with the GOMACO-exclusive G+ digital control system. G+ handles the controls conversion needed for each application while also bringing onboard Machine to Machine (M2M) communication, sonic sensors, 3D machine guidance, and more.
The GP460 is powered by a Caterpillar C7.1 turbocharged diesel engine to drive the conveyor belt and distribute concrete across the grade. The high-volume, 60 inch (1,524 mm) conveyor belt can be mounted on either the left or right side, depending on job-site conditions and the location of the haul road.
With the comeback of trade shows, companies are once again able to see concrete equipment up close and personal. In January, World of Concrete returned to Las Vegas, US with attendance of 48,000 registered professionals that was said to be close to pre-pandemic levels.
“The 2023 edition of World of Concrete far exceeded our expectations. The crowded show floor and packed educational sessions proves how essential meeting face to face is, that it remains important now more than ever to have a space to connect, to learn, to share across the concrete, masonry and construction industries as a vital contributor to our economy,” says Jackie James, Vice President, World of Concrete.
One of the biggest trends at both ConExpo and World of Concrete was the continued rise of technology and the impact it is having across the sector. New tech is influencing the way concrete construction equipment is designed and used.
Ingrid Schaar, assistant managing director at Ammann, breaks down how is it being implemented and why we are moving towards technologically advanced concrete equipment. “Since recycled material does not have the same properties as normal aggregates, new metering techniques are required here. The flow behaviour of recycled material requires special storage and metering technology,” she comments.
“Due to the larger selection of binders, the cement scales and the number of metering inlets were also adapted to the new challenges. Modern concrete mixer cleaning systems are more efficient than manual cleaning and thus help to reduce the amount of water needed to clean the concrete plant.”
Raphael Scheps, CEO of UK-based concrete technology company Converge, agrees with Schaar that technology is making its way into the sector, bringing a number of innovative ways to work.
When asked whether data can help streamline the time spent on concrete projects, Scheps replies promptly, “Certainly. With real-time data of in-situ concrete curing, you can take action at the soonest or safest moment possible. You take action precisely when you mean to rather than waiting for slow and sporadic lab results,” he says.
Converge digitises and optimises the physical world of construction by building AI and cloud-based technologies that are powered by a suite of smart wireless sensors. The company’s ConcreteDNA system gives users real-time concrete curing data and AI predictions that are viewable from any device.
Scheps believes that we’re merely scratching the surface of what’s possible for technology in the concrete industry. “Construction is one of the least digitised industries in the world, and yet one of the most fundamental to civilization; we will always need structures to maintain our society. We need construction technologies to make sure that construction is as optimal as possible to minimise adverse impact on the planet,” he says.
“One of our biggest drivers is to decarbonise concrete, the second most consumed material on earth. On a planet with finite resources our mission is to digitise the physical reality of construction in order to make it more efficient, safe, and sustainable.”
Sustainability is also a key focus for Ammann. “Due to the increasing scarcity of resources, the industry is more and more dependent on the use of alternative materials,” says Schaar. “The recycled material is used more and more for concrete production. In addition to this, new cements with less clinker content are being developed to reduce CO² emissions.”
For the whole sector, sustainability is increasingly high on the agenda. New materials coming to market for concrete production as well as new innovative types of concrete will both help to conserve resources and reduce CO² emissions.
Digitising physical reality on the jobsite could be the answer to building more sustainably but that can’t be done unless we measure. He says, “By digitising physical reality, we can track and measure it, allowing us to evaluate the impact of novel materials, methodologies and technologies. In this way we can continuously optimise processes to maximise impact,” says Scheps.
Measuring is also a key component of Doka’s Concremote. The solution uses sensors to measure the temperature and calculates compressive strength of the concrete structure. As the concrete reaches the predefined target value, Concremote will automatically notify the user in real-time by text message or email.
Elsewhere in the industry, the lack of skilled workers has meant that contractors are turning to more semi-automated features but despite construction’s growing enthusiasm for technology, the concrete industry is still largely reliant on workers to manage the machines.
“The task of the simple machinist has changed,” Shaar says. “Due to the high technical operating standards, the mechatronics engineer is a very important person here to monitor and maintain the many automatically controlled processes.”
Due to the changing nature of the construction landscape, the skills shortage and other global challenges the industry is seeking new ways to adapt. Off-site manufacturing has become an alternative solution and reduces the amount of workers that are needed onsite whilst equipment manufacturers are developing ways to streamline the way we work on concrete projects. New technologies are continuing to expand project capacity and decrease the time spent on particular challenges, thus increasing sustainability.
One of the key regions for this increased growth, according to the report, is the Asia Pacific market. The report also looks at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine on the concrete pumps market.
Main players in this sector include: Alliance Concrete Pump, Liebherr, Schwing Stetter, Sany Heavy Industry and Zoomlion.
Ecocem Superfine is a finer Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS) designed to be used as a specialist additive in binders, industrial mortars, UHPC, and precast concrete. In addition to reducing carbon emissions, the use of Superfine can improve rheology, strength, and durability of the concrete.
Developed by grinding Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GBS) to a very fine particle size, Superfine can be added to products to significantly improve their strengths in applications such as high performance and ultra-high-performance concrete.
The Superfine GGBS contains no chemical additions of chromium and has a low pH, making it a safe and effective additive for building material formulations.
“We’ve evolved over the years and want our brand to reflect that. We still design and manufacture concrete vibrators, but we’ve expanded to include flex shaft vibrators and concrete drills,” said Rob Minnich, President/CMO of Minnich Manufacturing.
The company was founded in 1968 to convert concrete paving machines from high-cycle vibrators to hydraulic vibrators. The previous logo included emanating rings, which represented the ripple effect of vibrators. Today, their product line expands beyond the vibrator product line and vibrator monitoring system to include dowel-pin drills, a dust collection system and an upright, lightweight utility drill."
04 April 2023,Liebherr reports record turnover for 2022,"The German-Swiss company posted an annual turnover of €12.59 billion, an improvement of €950 million on 2021 – which was the company’s previous record year for turnover.
According to its annual financial statement, Liebherr saw increases in 10 of its 13 product segments.
In its construction and mining segments – earthmoving, material handling technology, deep foundation machines, mobile and crawler cranes, tower cranes, concrete technology and mining equipment – the company reported an average increase in turnover of 6.9%.
Regional progress
From a regional perspective, the group’s turnover had increased only slightly in Europe – traditionally the strongest market for the company – but with positive movement in Italy and the Netherlands as highlights.
Liebherr reported more positive movement in turnover from its North, Central and South American activities, particularly in the US and Canada and in Brazil.
The company said it was pleased with the gains it had made in Africa as well as in the Near and Middle East, while turnover in Asia and Oceania was reported to be slightly above the previous year’s level.
R&D activity
The group spent €588 million in research and development during the 2022 business year; much of this was dedicated to alternative drive technologies.
Liebherr said it is taking a technology neutral approach to its research, which includes the increased use of hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVO), for potential use in construction equipment.
During the year, the company also added six crane and drilling rig models to its unplugged range of electric-drive machines.
Another area of research highlighted in the Liebherr statement was digitalisation; the company said it had focused on a number of segments, including camera-monitor and remote-control solutions for increased on-site safety, and advanced assistance systems, particularly for mining trucks.
Challenges and opportunities
Liebherr’s net income was reported at €2 million in 2022, with operating results and the financial result decreasing significantly compared with the previous year.
Employee numbers, however, grew in 2022, to 51,321 employees worldwide – an increase of 1,710 on the previous year.
Furthermore, the group invested €863 million in a mix of production sites and in its global distribution and service networks – an increase of €121 million on the previous year.
Looking ahead
The Liebherr Group reported positivity, in terms of its order book, but highlighted uncertainty regarding the war in Ukraine and the ongoing effects of sanctions against Russia.
In spite of ongoing macroeconomic challenges, broad price increases and labour shortages, the company forecast further growth in turnover in 2023."
17 March 2023,Is the impending death of the diesel combustion engine exaggerated?,"Whether it is the rush towards on-road electric vehicles or the steady stream of announcements from OEMs about their latest electric construction machinery, it can feel like the days of the diesel combustion engine are numbered.
In fact, while the range of electrically powered construction machines has increased drastically over the past few years, they still account for only a very small proportion of global sales. In Europe, it is perhaps 0.5% - almost all in small machine classes like mini excavators and compact wheel loaders.
In China, the number of electric vehicles sold is slightly higher thanks to the supply of larger wheel loaders and excavators up to about 20t.
But Off-Highway Research estimates the share of sales taken up by electric machines in China is still at most 1%.
Diesel-powered machines still dominate the off-highway landscape.
In the context of the Paris Agreement to reduce global warming to 1.5°C, that’s a problem.
But the death of the combustion engine, if not diesel itself, may have been exaggerated.
“OEMs are becoming jaded about the internal combustion engine (ICE), especially in the light vehicles area, and I think that is a mistake,” Dr Allen Aradi, fuels scientist at Shell Global Solutions, told the Diesel Progress Summit last year.
“It may not look feasible and convenient right now but as you approach 2050, you will find that low-carbon fuels and the combustion systems that burn them will become very important”.
Full electric machines will of course be part of the mix. But they won’t suit every application in construction, particularly at the heavier end of the scale. Batteries involve particular challenges when it comes to humidity and thermal management. That mean that combustion engines are often still preferable in certain harsh operating environments.
And then there is the cost. Anecdotally, an electric version of a compact tracked loader, for example, can currently end up more than double the price of its diesel-powered equivalent. Whereas a consumer may be prepared to pay extra to make a statement about their stance on the environment, for contractors around the world, it’s most likely to be the bottom line that determines buying decisions.
Charging machines could also prove to be a challenge, particularly in remote locations or where the time required to replenish the battery could interfere with scheduled work.
Energy from “green” hydrogen fuel cells also have the potential to be part of the solution but aren’t likely to be able to satisfy the energy and power intensity of all construction and earthmoving equipment. Some argue that fuel cells are also susceptible to harsh conditions, including humidity, altitude, dust, and shock and vibration. But companies developing them claim that durability is improving, with a fuel cell unit paired with a battery able to run as long or longer than a diesel engine. Where fuel cells are less advantageous is their high cost and the fact that the hydrogen required to run them still relatively difficult to obtain.
One of the principal advantages of diesel powertrains is that they are very compact. The drivetrain and energy storage take up less space than either a fuel cell system with no battery, which requires far more space for energy storage, or electric battery, which requires less space for the drivetrain but again far more for the energy storage. And when the energy storage volume on a machine cannot be increased, then its operating time until refuelling has to decrease.
Diesel engines are already 95% cleaner than they were in terms of emissions. They have also become more efficient but not to the extent that they can solve the carbon emissions challenge. Construction will need to wean itself off diesel in order to hit its carbon reduction targets.
But that’s not to say that combustion engines can’t remain part of the mix, alongside battery electric and fuel cells. “Virtually all engine manufacturers are looking at electrification and fuel cells.
“But combustion engines will be around for a long time in my opinion, especially off-road, where electrification is challenged to address the needs of the applications,” says Mike Brezonick, vice president of editorial at KHL Group’s power division.
Dr Ingo Wintruff, managing director of Liebherr’s combustion engine business, speaking at last year’s Diesel Progress Summit, said, “The concern is not the combustion engine but the fuel that is burned. Combustion engines have unbeatable advantages under harsh conditions and they have become favourable for higher energy and higher power densities.”
What’s more, the injection technology for alternative fuels, particularly hydrogen, already exists. While accepting that combustion is not the one and only solution, Liebherr is working to develop a high parts commonality among its ICEs to allow for minimal adaption of its engines in order to allow them to handle different fuels.
That’s not to say that alternative fuels for combustion engines are without challenges.
ICEs running on hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO) are already relatively commonplace in certain regions. In late 2022, for example, construction and infrastructure contractor BAM committed to HVO fuels as part of the strategy for the decarbonisation of its operations by 2026.
Not everyone agrees on the approach, however. In a position paper released last year, Balfour Beatty pointed to “serious issues” with HVO in terms of its traceability and carbon footprint claims which it said needed to be “ironed out” before it could commit.
The disagreement points to a wider uncertainty around not just the claims around the sustainability of alternative fuels but also their ability to keep up with potential demand.
JCB unveiled its first zero-carbon emissions hydrogen-fuelled engine at ConExpo 2023 in Last Vegas, US. The company has invested £100 million (US$120 million) in the project and already has working prototypes running in a backhoe loader and telescopic handler. It has also developed a mobile refuelling system, which allows hydrogen to be taken from onsite tube trailers and distributed to machines by a refueller as they work on the job site, in a similar way to using a bowser to refuel diesel machines.
Nonetheless, one industry insider described the infrastructure to refuel hydrogen-powered engines as “pre-natal”. Unsurprising, considering that the engine technology itself is still in the early stages.
If alternative fuels like HVO or hydrogen for combustion engines are to help in the construction industry’s efforts to decarbonise, then they will require very rapid scaling up, in addition to cast-iron assurances about their sustainability.
Dr Aradi, while presenting to the Diesel Progress Summit, noted, “On the fuel side, we need to do a lot more basic science so we can pass that on to OEMs so they can properly optimise their engines.” He said that such fuels are a “must” rather than a choice and that they have the potential to offset demand for diesel. But the volumes at which they are produced are not going to keep up with demand unless something happens.
While there is enough availability of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO), ethanol and methanal to satisfy demand until 2035, Aradi indicated that more scaling up would be required to meet demand from 2035-2050.
In the case of more exotic options like bio naphtha, bio natural gas, hydrogen (blue of green) and ammonia, there isn’t currently enough availability and they would require even further scaling up to meet future demand.
He called for a road map and collaboration between fuel suppliers, OEMs and regulators to establish production process and ramp up volumes.
Aradi said he saw the need to implement “nature-based solutions” to grow feed stocks and stressed that they will need to be sustainable. And he suggested fixing water management problems in semi-arid, low-populations areas like equatorial Africa, before turning land there to biomass growth.
He added, “And then when we come to regulators, they need to simplify the process for introducing these new molecules into the market. Fuel suppliers and OEMs need to put pressure on the regulators to make sure that as these zero-carbon fuels become feasible and available, we run them right into the market without the usual red tape.”
Work to make diesel “cleaner”, particularly as far as particulate and NOx emissions are concerned, is likely to continue.
The EU’s Stage V non-road emissions standards for non-road vehicles are currently the most stringent in the world.
Meanwhile, the US is likely to move towards Tier 5 standards, with implementation likely around 2026-27.
And China implemented the first China National Standard 4 off-road regulations last year, covering all diesel non-road equipment under 560kW. The standards are based on EU Stage 3B, with the addition of limits on particle counts that result in the requirement to use a diesel particulate filter. The standard for smaller engines (under 37kW) is modelled after Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 2 standards.
A continued focus on reducing the harmful emissions from diesel engines reflects the fact that are likely to predominate in off-highway construction applications for some time to come.
Predicting the future, particularly in light of the events of the last few years, has become something of a mug’s game.
But it is likely to take decades before other forms of power generation start to overtake diesel engines."
09 March 2023,Fehmarnbelt: the technology behind the world’s longest immersed tube tunnel,"Visible for miles around as clusters of orange tower cranes and huge yellow excavators standing out against the long grey mudflats topped with January snow and the greyer waters of the Baltic Sea, construction work is in full swing on the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel, a road and rail mega tunnel set to connect Demark and Germany.
Jens Ole Kaslund, technical director at Femern A/S – the body charged with building the 18km long tunnel – nods enthusiastically when asked about the challenges involved in such a project.
“We will be beating two world records by constructing the world’s longest immersed tunnel and the world’s longest combined road and rail tunnel,” he says proudly. “That is in itself an impressive construction and engineering achievement.”
With construction of the record-breaking €7.1bn project now heading into its third year and scheduled to be completed in 2029, engineers around the world will be watching progress with interest, eager to see further applications for the construction techniques and technologies being put into practice in the Fehmarnbelt.
Kaslund, a former project director at Danish rail group Banedanmark, has been working on the project for the last five years and has had overall responsibility for its success since 2019. He says he jumped at the chance of taking the role at the specially-created subsidiary of state-owned Danish transport company Sund & Bælt.
“When I got the opportunity to be part of this amazing project and be part of connecting Scandinavia and central Europe with the longest immersed tunnel in world, I was not a second in doubt,” he grins.
Immersed tunnelsUsed since the 1890s as a quick and cheap way of building channels for transport and utilities under rivers and harbours, immersed tube tunnels have historically been seen as a third-choice option for most major infrastructure projects, behind bridges and bored tunnels.
Certainly, the Danish government, which is providing the lion’s share of the development funding, initially planned to complete the rail and road link via a striking cable-stayed bridge similar to the Øresund Bridge, to the east of the country, which connects Denmark with Sweden via a combined railway and motorway bridge, and which opened in 2000.
However, as design teams started to consider the plans in detail, they began to worry that any structure built across the 18km Fehmarn Strait would be vulnerable to prevailing east-west winds and would create a high risk of shipping collisions.
A second option, which would have been drilling under the sea floor using a tunnel boring machine (TBM) similar to the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, was also ruled out because the seabed was deemed unsuitable for drilling. The depths involved would have made it difficult for high speed trains to get across without significantly expanding the length of the tunnel and the requirements for dual track train and motorway shafts would have necessitated the use of multiple TBMs, making the project much more expensive.
Instead, in 2011, the design teams finally opted to build an immersed tube tunnel (IMT), an undersea tunnel comprising prefabricated segments fitted together. This is the type of tunnel used for the 4,050m Drogden Tunnel which forms part of the Øresund crossing, linking an artificial island at the end of the bridge with Amager Island in Denmark.
“The immersed tunnel solution has many advantages,” Kaslund says. “It is economically more feasible; a tunnel is not affected by weather; it can be constructed almost without interfering with the extensive [shipping] traffic through the Fehmarnbelt; the environmental impact on marine life is less; and we have a lot of experience with immersed tunnels from other Danish projects such as the Øresund Link and Storebælt link. Further, the immersed tunnel was evaluated to be less risky compared to a bridge solution.”
Technically challengingLess risky it may be, but the project comes with its own set of technical challenges. For one thing, there is the scale: the tunnel will be nearly three times longer than the IMT section of the Hong Kong-Zuhai–Macau Fixed Link, currently the longest tube tunnel in the world,
To build such an enormous project, Femern A/S has spent two years preparing the site, constructing a specially built harbour capable of receiving up to 80,000 tonnes of material deliveries each week, accommodation for 1,300 workers and, even more impressively, the world’s largest tunnel factory where the concrete tunnel sections will be made.
Tunnel size: The tunnel will have a 17.6km immersed section and will be 42 meters wide. Its foundation depths will reach more than 40 meters below sea level. It will comprise five tubes: two 2-lane motorways for cars; two electrified rail tunnels; and one emergency corridor.Construction timing: Enabling works started on the project on the Danish side in 2020 and the German side in 2021. Dredging of the tunnel trench and construction of the factory began in 2021. The first tunnel segment is expected to be laid before summer 2024 and the project is scheduled to complete in 2029.
This facility, which is currently undergoing its finishing touches, is located close to what will be the Danish tunnel entrance in Rødbyhavn, and is set to be the biggest factory building in Denmark. It will eventually cover around 1 million square metres and have six production lines on which 89 huge tunnel sections, each 220m long and 40m wide and weighing a whopping 73,000 tonnes, will be cast. Divided into three production halls, currently Hall B is 95% complete with its first production line ready to start casting the first segment. Halls A and C meanwhile are expected to be finished later this year.
The elements will be cast step-by-step in segments of approximately 24m in the factory. Because the tunnel sections are so big, they will actually be made in pieces so that each standard element will be made up of nine segments.
To reduce both construction time and complexity, Kaslund says the design team attempted to produce the largest sections feasibly possible, which they could cast safely in one sitting without risk of cracks, based on experience from other immersed tunnel projects and similar casting technology on other projects.
And, for the plan to work, each massive segment must be made in the factory to exactly the right specifications.
Concrete castingEach segment is cast from layers of concrete built up on top of each other in a manner Kaslund likens to “baking an enormous advanced cake.”
Casting each segment according to a detailed plan takes 36 hours of continuous pouring and can be painstaking as workers must ensure that the concrete is exactly the right temperature and consistency – not too cold, not too hot, not too wet and not too dry - before moving on to the next layer and the next.
“The greatest challenge lies in ensuring the quality of the casting,” Kaslund says. “Each element comprises nine segments and each segment needs precision in the casting. The production of the element is done in a climate-controlled environment to ensure the highest quality possible.”
In fact, the tunnel elements are so large that there is no facility big enough to store them, meaning that as soon as each one is completed it must be taken out to sea and installed straight away.

With so much at stake during the casting, Kaslund and his team have opted to try out the process by having a couple of trial runs. To do this they have built a massive test bed facility where they have had a go at prefabricating blocks containing one and a half rail tube segments.
During the final months of 2022 they completed two blocks of 1½ rail tube segments, ensuring that casting, concrete, formworks, quality and other important details are exactly the same as they will be in the real segments. Kaslund says the team is “still reviewing the results.”
Dredging workOut in the Fehmarn Belt, dredging work on the tunnel trench has been in progress since mid-2021 and is 70% complete. This work is due to finnish next year to enable the first tunnel segment to be laid in the trench before summer 2024.
The contract for dredging and ground reclamation was awarded in 2016 to Fehmarn Belt Contractors (FBC), a joint venture between Dutch dredging specialists Van Oord and Boskalis.
So far, the dredging team has already come up against a number of unusual challenges, including navigating their way around the wreck of a seventeenth century Danish warship and an unexploded second world war bomb.
A fleet of up to nine different dredgers has been pressed into action on the project. Vox Amalia, a Trailing Suction Hopper Dredge (TSHD) - which entered service for Van Oord in March 2020 - acts like a giant, floating vacuum cleaner, hoovering up debris and transporting it has taken on the bulk of the work. She has been assisted by Fetsy and Manta, two barges purchased by FBC and mounted with specialist Liebherr and Mteck cranes for lifting heavy boulders.
In total, the dredging will result in around 19 million cubic meters of sand, stone and soil, which will be used to build a new 300-hectare beach near Rødbyhavn.
Placing the segmentsOnce a complete tunnel segment has been manufactured in the factory, it will be rolled out and taken to an upper basin where it will be fitted with temporary steel bulkheads at both ends to make it watertight and ensure it floats.
Huge doors will close behind it, allowing the basin to then be flooded with water – rather like a lock on a canal. This will allow tugboats to move each section down to the lower basin and then out to sea.
For the crews on the tugboats the challenge is clear – positioning each 217m 73,500 tonne floating concrete tunnel segment in exactly the right spot so that when its ballast tanks are flooded with water, each element will sink 40m to the seabed, landing in the dredged trench next to one another and within 15mm of its target.
“We demand a high degree of precision,” agrees Kaslund. “We are talking about kilometre-long distances, so when we dig the tunnel trench and place the individual elements, even small deviations along the way can have great significance. Our work must be extremely precise, so when the last element is placed, we need an accuracy of very few millimetres.”
To achieve this, Kaslund says the construction team has developed its own “unique GPS-system” which relies on the latest technology to improve GPS accuracy from the typical range of several metres used in mobile phones and cars to an accuracy of 8mm horizontally and 15mm vertically.
The system is being supplied by Danish company Geoteam, which won an EU tender to supply the reference network for the project in spring 2020. It works by boosting the satellite signals available in the construction area by installing 10 stationary terrestrial Global Navigation Satellite Systems stations (GNSS stations).
As anyone using a modern car SatNav system knows only too well, satellite signals to Earth can be weak and quickly run into disturbances, leading to inaccuracies. The GNSS stations, which are located on both the Danish and German sides of the Fehmarn Belt, correct for errors in the satellite signals so that construction machinery and ships can navigate with high accuracy. (Four of the stations have been built by Femern A/S and six by Geoteam.)
Kaslund says that by eliminating these errors, the positioning system can provide tugboat teams with the exact coordinates necessary to lower the tunnel segments into position.
So far that hasn’t been tested for real because the first tunnel segments are expected to be placed later this year. However, Kaslund says that the system has already been used for more than a year by the construction equipment that is helping to build the 500,000 square metre work port.
Gina gasket solutionKaslund says that during the manufacturing process, one end of each tunnel segment is mounted with a Gina gasket, which is a huge hollow vulcanised rubber fitting designed to sit around the entire end of the segment.
In a process which has changed little over the past 70 years, the Gina gasket is then used to connect the segments forming a watertight seal.
Once an element has been laid in the trench, it is coupled together with the adjacent segment and pulled against it using hydraulic jacks. As the elements are brought together the gasket squashes around the join, forming a small reservoir between the two steel bulkheads. The construction team then gets to work pumping the water out of this reservoir which makes the water pressure on the other end of the element compress the Gina profile which seals the joint.
Later a second rubber seal, known as an Omega seal, is then clamped across the joint on the inside of the tunnel and, once the pressure between the Gina and Omega seals has been tested, the temporary bulkheads are removed.
“At the start of the project we evaluated several possible solutions to improve the existing [Gina] joint technology but we did not find solutions superior to the well-known technology developed slightly from the 1950s,” Kaslund says. “Also the size of the tunnel project was assessed to be too long to try a new technology before testing it in smaller scale.”
The process continues until all the elements are in place. Then, Kaslund says, they will be secured in the tunnel trench with gravel and sand and covered with a protective layer of stone which will be level with the existing seabed.
Once that is complete, the construction team can begin work on the tunnel’s technical and mechanical installations such as railway tracks, ventilation, cameras, communication systems, signage and painting, which then must be thoroughly tested before the tunnel’s expected opening date of mid-2029.
+100 year design lifeKaslund says that once in operation, the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel has been designed to be used for well over a century, justifying the €7.1bn cost.
Femern A/S hopes to recoup that cash by charging car drivers a toll – likely to be set at close to the rate for the ferry crossing, which is currently around €100.
And, by halving journey times between Scandinavia and Central Europe, Femern predicts that the tunnel will be so popular that it could be $4bn in profit after just 50 years.
By providing a viable ‘green’ alternative to flying, the tunnel can also justify the huge carbon cost involved in its creation. And, as technology continues to evolve to include more powerful EV batteries and electrified roads that recharge cars’ batteries as they drive, Kaslund predicts that demand could be even greater.
“The tunnel will be built to last at least 120 years so the project will pay itself back CO2-wise many times over in its lifespan,” he says.
“This is based on today’s technology in the car fleet and the ferries and our traffic model prognosis. New developments of transportation technology within the next 10-20 years such as e-roads would therefore have a positive effect on the payback time.”"

28 February 2023,ConExpo 2023: Show Guide,"It’s official: ConExpo-Con/Agg the biggest trade show in North America, is getting even bigger. The Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), the organisers of the event held every three years, has announced that all available exhibit space for the upcoming show has been sold out, guaranteeing the 2023 edition will be the biggest in its history.
“The addition of the new West Hall and Diamond Lot at the Las Vegas Convention Center gave us, and our exhibitors, a number of new opportunities to show how we are taking the construction industry to the next level,” said Dana Wuesthoff, ConExpo-Con/Agg show director. “Now at 2.8 million sq. ft. of exhibits, there’s more for construction pros to see than ever before.”
Nearly 5% bigger than the record set in 2020, the show will feature 1,800 exhibitors and 150 education sessions during its run from March 14-18, 2023.
Despite being the largest show ever, AEM noted that recent additions to the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) will make it the easiest to get around as well. Beneath the entire LVCC campus runs the Convention Center Loop, an underground transportation system designed by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. It transports convention attendees throughout the campus in under two minutes in Tesla vehicles, free of charge.
AEM said attendee registrations were also on strong pace, as pre-registrations are nearly double what they were at the same time for the 2020 show.
“This is the event that construction professionals, especially those making company-level decisions, and those needing professional development hours, can’t miss,” said Caterpillar Senior Vice President Phil Kelliher, who is ConExpo-Con/Agg show chair. “Seeing the new equipment and techniques on a screen doesn’t compare to seeing it all in person.
“At the show, you can see the equipment, ask questions of the manufacturers themselves, and really understand what the equipment and education can do for your career and business.”
A selection of equipment manufacturers are teasing what they have in store for attendees. Alice Banach, senior marketing manager for Doosan Infracore North America, revealed that ConExpo will be the first-time attendees will be able to see the new brand on its construction equipment, hear the story of why it was chosen and what’s coming next.
“In November 2019, Doosan Infracore showed the first successful live demonstration of a fully autonomous excavator and wheel loader. The demonstration took place at our proving grounds in South Korea,” she explains. “We have developed this technology further and will show the next generation of Concept-X in a demonstration area in our exhibit. There will be other new products and technologies on display including the Doosan electric-powered DX20ZE-7 mini excavator.”
The message the company is conveying with its exhibit is a continuation of a long history of orange equipment in North America.
“We are nearing 40 years since we entered this market. We are the same company with the same talented dealers and staff evolving to the next chapter for the industry,” says Banach. “We expect a lot of interest in the new brand, but the most important message is that the machines have not changed, only the name on them,” she said.
The machines on display will include the new DD100 dozer and the first 100-metric-ton crawler excavator: the DX1000LC-7. As for new product introductions, Banach says Doosan will have a few new products that the North American market will see for the first time and some that will be their global debut. “Our second dozer, the DD130, will be shown, as well as the latest working Concept-X models will be on display,” she added.
For its part, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) readies itself for a return to ConExpo for the first time since 2017. The company pulled out of the 2020 show due to looming concerns over the spread of Covid-19, which wound up shortening the show by one day and emptied Las Vegas shortly thereafter.
Stephen Roy, president, Region North America, at Volvo CE, says it’s important for equipment manufacturers to make their presence known to construction industry professionals planning to attend.
“For me, it’s really being able to highlight where Volvo is and where we’re at in our journey during a time that has been transformative in our industry,” he says. “ConExpo-Con/Agg offers us a chance to showcase what we have, gather feedback from our customers and engage our industry partners.
“To really make a show like ConExpo-Con/Agg work, the face-to-face aspect of it is so important,” he adds. “I think that’s why Las Vegas is the perfect venue. It attracts so many people, and with all the changes we’re seeing in our industry, I think it’ll be the perfect environment for people to find the latest and greatest innovations, as well as learn what will help their business succeed.”
Volvo is driving a focus on sustainable power and automation, and how it can help customers be more productive, efficient and successful in their efforts to serve their own customers.
“We always say our goal is to make customers successful with their customers, so that’s the approach we’re taking. More specifically, we’ll have a mix of existing product, product that’s coming out soon and some forward-looking product that – like I mentioned before – will illustrate where the industry is going,” says Roy. “That means a focus on sustainability, using electric machines and other sustainable power.”
Volvo CE will also showcase small compact electric equipment, all the way to larger equipment that has a mix of electric and diesel.
When asked how he feels about Volvo’s return to live, in-person events, Roy says, “We’re very focused on making events and exhibitions like ConExpo-Con/Agg a really valuable experience, so when our attendees are in the booth, they have access to the right information and the right experts who can answer their questions – and we want them to have fun in our booth too.”
Metso Outotec will present its latest innovations, technologies and offerings for the aggregates industry at ConExpo.
“Throughout the whole aggregates and construction industry, sustainability is gaining ground and has become a big driver for innovations and operations,” says Juha Yli-Petäys, SVP, Global Distribution Management at Metso Outotec.
“For us at Metso Outotec, sustainability and improved performance are among our key goals with our customers and present in every R&D project. At ConExpo-Con/Agg, we will demonstrate our groundbreaking innovations that address our customers’ key challenges like energy consumption, uptime, safety or carbon footprint reduction,” he continues.
Product on display will include the Nordberg HP cone crusher and Lokotrack track-mounted crushers and screens – the company has said it will give a ‘sneak peek’ at the future vision of the next generation of Lokotracks. ​
John Deere Power Systems (JDPS) is expanding its product portfolio to include a diversified range of powertrain and electronic solutions. These products will be on display as the company provides insight into how these technologies will impact the industry’s journey towards a more sustainable future.
Show attendees have the opportunity to see JDPS’s first engines based on new architecture, the JD4, JD14, and JD18, all of which will be on display together for the first time. John Deere will also feature its new split path electrical mechanical transmission in the booth, which offers improved productivity, ease of operation, uptime, and efficiency all while paving the way to hybridisation and potential for off-boarding electrical power.
Show attendees will have the opportunity to check out the latest developments in Kreisel immersion cooled batteries and John Deere charging technology in the booth.
Caterpillar will show off more than 30 machines at ConExpo, in what it claims is its largest exhibit to date.
The OEM has taken a 70,000 sq ft demonstration area for the show at the Operator Stadium in the Festival Lot.

The Liebherr booths at ConExpo offers space for more than 30 exhibits on a total exhibition area of almost 5,600m². The area was enlarged by approximately 670m² due to the addition of a demo area, where Liebherr will show its machines in action for the first time at ConExpo.
Numerous new products and developments from the areas of construction machines, cranes and material handling technology are on display. In addition, Liebherr presents the latest innovations from its components product segment in the South Hall.
For the first time in North America, Liebherr is presenting its new medium-sized wheeedl loaders, which are equipped with a wide range of digital assistance systems.
With a significant increase in performance compared to the previous models, the new machines are prepared for demanding applications in various industries such as mining, recycling or the timber industry.
Road construction equipment manufacturer Road Widener will show the FH-R material placement attachment, which it says provides contractors with 50% reduced labour at less cost than a traditional self-propelled equipment.
Additionally, the remote-controlled design of the attachment allows the operator of the host machine to control the attachment via remote control – enhancing safety by eliminating the danger of additional workers standing along the jobsite.
“With the current Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal there is a renewed focus on repairing and reconstructing our nation’s roadways,” said Lynn Marsh, Road Widener president. “Now is the time to modernise our infrastructure, making it safer and more resilient. The FH-R allows contractors to get the job done more quickly and efficiently.”
Trackunit will showcase two major new solutions at ConExpo. The company says that it will introduce a set of site-focused features and capabilities to drive efficiencies in the construction industry to the next level by allowing users to leverage live machine data with connectivity to build their site-based business processes.
In addition to these new site-based capabilities, Trackunit says that fleet owners will have enhanced visibility by removing blind spots on job sites, inside buildings, storage containers, and tool depots alongside a new CO2 reporting solution.
Where job-site coverage needs to be enhanced, Trackunit’s new gateway device will provide continuous Bluetooth connectivity throughout the life of the job site. The gateway device enables visibility to approximate indoor location for Trackunit Kin tracked assets and third-party Bluetooth tags while creating a more robust Bluetooth network on the job site.
Wirtgen will present a cross-section of its cold milling, recycling, soil stabilising and concrete paving products on the joint booth shared by Wirtgen Group and John Deere.
Alongside nine exhibits from three product sectors, the focus will also be on digital system solutions and assistance systems.
Among the equipment on display will be the W 50 Ri, Wirtgen’s powerful half-metre cold milling machine with rear loading. Its features include a simple operating concept and automatic functions. The W 120 Fi front loader has been designed for working widths of up to 1.3 m (4ft 3in).
The F-Series compact milling machine is fitted with a John Deere engine that has been customised to meet the special demands of cold milling applications. Two large F-Series milling machines complete the cold milling machine range on show.
Cold recycling and soil stabilising equipment will also be on show, such as the W 380 CRi as well as the WR 200 XLi and WR 250i. The W 380 CRi with rear loading and a mixing performance of up to 800 t/h is used for rehabilitating wide roads. It can be deployed in both cold in-place recycling (CIR) and in full-depth reclaiming (FDR) projects.
Besides cold recycling, the WR-Series wheel-driven recyclers can also carry out soil stabilising tasks. With a working width of 2.4m (7 ft 10 in) as well as high milling and mixing performances, they are well-equipped for use in demanding projects with high daily outputs. The digital system solutions, the AutoTrac steering system and the WPT (Wirtgen Performance Tracker) documentation system further increase process efficiency.
JCB will present its newly-developed hydrogen internal combustion engine at ConExpo. This will be the debut for the H2 ICE engine in North America and the first time it has been presented outside the UK.
The new engine will be presented as part of the International Fluid Power Exposition (IFPE).
Speaking about the H2 ICE, JCB chairman Lord Bamford, said, “The JCB engineering team has made enormous strides in a short space of time to develop a hydrogen internal combustion engine and it already powers a JCB prototype backhoe loader and a Loadall telescopic handler.
“As the first construction equipment company to develop a fully working combustion engine fuelled by hydrogen, I’m delighted we are now able to present this technology on the international stage.”
The H2 ICE will play a key part in the company’s Road to Zero programme. JCB has already launched what is billed as the world’s first battery-electric mini excavator as part of its E-Tech range.
A range of electric machines produced by JCB will also be on display at the show.
Crushing and screening equipment manufacturer McCloskey will reveal a new colour scheme for its entire product portfolio at ConExpo.
The company, which is known for its distinctive green brand colour, said the updated livery design would create, “a unified and a more contemporary look” across its product range.
Toni Laaksonen, senior vice president at McCloskey International, said, “As McCloskey and its allied brands grow in response to rising demand globally, we continually are seeking new ways to enhance the brand while ensuring we maintain the equity we have built over time.
“This update reflects our commitment to the foundation built on the McCloskey green while refreshing the product line with a modern approach.”
McCloskey’s green colour will now feature on the chassis and galvanized steel handrails of both its existing and new equipment models – which include electric powered and hybrid machines."
23 February 2023,How to increase the sustainability of tall infrastructure,"Tall buildings pose a unique challenge to sustainability because they offer both positive and negative environmental impacts. Positive impacts include reducing urban sprawl, promoting alternative transportation, and allowing efficient energy use on a district scale. But these benefits come at the cost of emitting more carbon dioxide to produce the required materials and to construct the building.
A tall building’s embodied carbon footprint is significantly higher than low-rise buildings on a per-square-foot basis. This is because the structure is usually responsible for the majority of a building’s embodied carbon footprint, and tall buildings require more structure to support their height.
Tall buildings have typically been constructed using steel or concrete, but what if there was an alternative that used more sustainable materials?
Architecture and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and researchers from Oregon State University recently launched a research project investigating the performance characteristics of a hybrid wood and concrete structural floor system that may offer the industry a traditional flat plate construction alternative.
The research project’s purpose was to study and develop a conceptual structural system for tall buildings that are as sustainable as possible while remaining cost competitive with contemporary building techniques.
Sustainability is a challenge for high rise construction – another is a lack of space. Constructing a 50-storey building on the corner of two of the most well-known streets in central London took this to extremes with the development of 8 Bishopsgate.
“After many changes to both the client’s requirements and our own recommendations, we agreed that four tower cranes would be required on site at any one time, with two cranes moving onto the building’s two cores when they reached full height,” said Adrian Hawkins, Wolffkran sales director.
However, one of these cranes – TC1a – would require some clever thinking and a unique design if it was to work at all. Crane TC1a was to be a WOLFF 275 B, with a 45m jib that would be parked at a 13m radius out of service.
This crane would need to climb up the inside of a lift shaft that was only 2.9m wide. Additionally, its sway had to be kept to a minimum to ensure it did not clash with the jump-form rig being used to construct the shaft.
The use of 2m wide mast sections was considered but eventually discounted. “The tower would not have been stiff enough to limit the sway sufficiently if we’d used 2m sections,” commented Bernard Holman, Wolffkran engineering manager. “And the dimensions of the climbing collars was still too big to fit within the confines of the 2.9m lift shaft.”
Therefore, a sway-limiting 2.3m internal climber was used, but without the climbing collars.
As speculation continues around whether or not the 1km-tall Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia will ever be finished, plans are already afoot to build a 2km-tall skyscraper in the kingdom.
A 2km-tall building would exceed the world’s current tallest building, the 828-metre-high Burj Khalifa, by nearly 1.2km. And the Burj Khalifa is itself more than 300m higher than the 508m-tall Taipei 101, which was previously the world’s tallest building.
Such huge increases in height beg the question: are there limits to building supertall buildings and what governs those limits?
Peter Weismantle, director of supertall building technology at architecture firm at Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture based in Chicago, US, has decades of experience working on tall buildings.
He was part of the team that designed the 88-storey Jin Mao tower in Shanghai, China. In 2003, he took on the role of senior technical architect for the Burj Khalifa and helped to design the Jeddah Tower.
“I don’t think the limits are technological. First is money and the economics of these tall buildings,” he tells KHL.
“In order to build tall, you have to build a big building in the sense that it has a lot of area – a lot of surface area and a lot of floor area. That is money. And the taller you go, the more the cost per square metre goes up.”
Tied to the cost of building structures at such a huge scale is the amount of time it takes – and time also means money. “In order to build these things anywhere near efficiently, you have got to build them quickly. And quick for a supertall means about five years. That is a long time, especially now with inflation the way it is,” he adds.
High-rise buildings built with timber have been appearing more frequently on horizons as companies develop new products, techniques and materials to increase the sustainability of tall infrastructure. Norway has been spearheading this trend, finalising the wooden 85.4m Mjøstårnet in Brumunddal, but there is an even taller timber tower in the US.
Ascent, an 86.6-metre-tall mass-timber tower in Wisconsin designed by Korb + Associates Architects, was certified as the world’s tallest timber building in August 2022. It appears that the race has only just begun though. The Indian Ocean Island of Zanzibar is planning what is reported to be the next highest ‘green’ building in the world – a 28-storey apartment tower designed in hybrid timber technology.
Named Burj Zanzibar – burj meaning tower in Arabic – the high-rise is designed to reach 96 metres in height. It has been called a ‘vertical green village’ and would be the first timber structure in the world of such proportions.
The design of the mixed-use apartment and commercial building, in a beehive style, was unveiled to the public in October 2022. Dutch-born architect Leander Moons, responsible for the concept, said, “Burj Zanzibar is not just an outstanding building but a new ecosystem for the future of living.”
The tower, which will have 266 residences, is to be located in Fumba Town, East Africa’s eco-town developed by German-led engineering firm CPS. It is planned as a hybrid timber tower with a steel-reinforced concrete core designed to meet all required fire and life safety standards. The project is to be executed by a consortium of leading specialists from Switzerland, Austria, Germany, South Africa, Tanzania and the US. When completed, it would be the highest timber building in the world.
In 2017, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat published ‘Tall Timber: A Global Audit’. The study accounted for all 48 known mass-timber projects of seven stories or higher that had either been proposed, was under construction, or was completed.
The mass timber movement has gained significant momentum since then with more than 200 mass timber buildings around the world that are seven stories or higher. Wood has undergone remarkable advances in its technological capabilities.
Recently, Ramboll and architecture studio Haptic Architects partnered to explore sustainable development through a regenerative modular tower. Doug Baldock, Director and Head of High Rise UK at Ramboll, says that to reduce carbon, the main structural frame centres around a timber structure comprising three-storey high-structural hard decks, with each hard or permanent deck supporting three intermediate soft or temporary decks.
“The regenerative high-rise uses hard floors, which are plated with cross-laminated timber (CLT). The load-carrying structures are made using a combination of glue-laminated timber sections and recycled steel,” said Baldock.
By adopting this approach to high-rise construction, it was possible to consider the modules in terms of volume, not floor area, boosting the flexibility and adaptability of the whole structure.
“Instead of demolishing the entire building,” adds Baldock, “obsolete modules can simply be replaced with new ones, without horizontal or vertical constraints, to fulfil new spatial requirements. Embedding flexibility and adaptability into construction philosophy provides an opportunity to make real progress towards sustainable high-rise buildings.”
As the structures are designed to last for a long time, the choice of building material for modular high-rise construction was based on keeping the carbon footprint to a minimum.
Those behind the sustainable structure hope to create a new precedence in the building industry. “In theory, adopting these construction philosophies could lead to buildings that could potentially last forever,” adds Baldock.
Falsework and formwork specialist Meva highlights that, whilst timber is a greener choice for some applications, this needs to be balanced against the environmental impact of deforestation to harvest the material and the waste created from plywood formwork.
Plywood formwork stores harmful carbon within the material, protecting the environment. Additionally, it can also be harvested and produced locally, so that the material does not have to travel so far to the site – which saves emissions from transportation vehicles.
With increased popularity for its sustainable properties comes increased demand, which is fuelling deforestation and creating an ecological balance, says Meva. According to the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF), trade in forest products has increased significantly in the last five decades, with illegal logging representing 40–50% of all logging in some cases.
The WWF adds that as forests store large amounts of carbon, destroying these areas contributes to global warming by releasing carbon into the atmosphere – around 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by deforestation.
As projects are becoming increasingly ambitious, construction technology is developing at a pace that demonstrates its ability to support new and bold ideas.
Baldock of Ramboll believes that a powerful tool to create sustainable solutions for high-rises is integration with the digital environment.
“Tall buildings can be designed as platforms to take full advantage of the latest and future smart technology. Thousands of smart sensors feed data to the integrated Building Management Systems to allow the building to adapt and optimise for improved energy efficiency, safety and security.”
Despite sustainability traditionally being about the implementation of energy-efficient and renewable technologies to enhance the ‘green’ credentials of the building Baldock says that it is also about delivering a liveable environment to maximise the health, well-being and comfort of occupants.
“Using these strategies in an integrated way creates value for both our clients and society as a whole – and provides a blueprint for a sustainable high-rise.”
Providing the island nation of Mauritius with alternative access to its capital, Port-Louis, Doka worked with TGBV JV Transinvest-GCC-Bouygues TP-VLSi to deliver a solution for the country’s Road Development Authority, which centred around providing a formwork solution for the A1-M1 Link Road Grand River North-West Valley Bridge BR5.
Upon completion, the bridge will link two of the country’s most important highways, while helping commuters to avoid the long and often steep roads that traverse the nearby valleys and canyons.
Designed around a two-pier structure, with the highway suspended from pylons at a height of 90m, Doka’s engineers had to factor in seasonal weather conditions such as cyclones, which have already tested the project’s design with winds reaching in excess of 190km/h.
Both piers were built with a step height of 4.50 metres, poured in weekly cycles during typical lifts, with the centre wall thickness of each pier increasing with height. A formwork system was implemented to avoid changing out panels during transitions, while considering changes to platform design, soffit formwork and safe direct climbing platform access from stair towers and access hoists.
The project is estimated to be delivered in 2023.
Ten Liebherr EC-B series tower cranes are involved in a €650 million (US$705 million) project in France to build the largest timber campus in Europe.
The campus is designed to create a new connection between nature and the workplace using solid wood construction.
The ‘Arboretum’ project on the banks of the Seine will provide 125,000 square metres of office and service space and will be mostly built of solid wood.
Measures designed to reduce the site’s carbon footprint include the reuse of materials, bioclimatic architecture and a geothermal system that will cover up to 80% of heating and cooling requirements.
Liebherr says that their top-slewing cranes are being used for positioning timber and concrete elements such as posts, beams, columns, staircases and lifts. This work is supported by the Micromove fine positioning mode.
The assistance system is said to make use of Liebherr’s drives so that loads are moved with precision over the course of several minutes and positioned with accuracy, which is said to protect precast filigree concrete parts as well as existing constructions.
Frankfurt Airport, Terminal 3, is currently one of Europe’s largest infrastructure projects, due to be completed in 2024. Peri assisted Max Bögl with the construction of the drive-by platform, which will provide passengers with direct access to the departure level of Terminal 3.
The 550m long and 27m wide drive-by platform with its total bridge area of 15,300m² is supported by 70 V-shaped columns at a height of over 10m and connects the two access and departure ramps to the terminal. Engineers from Peri designed a customised formwork carriage using the VARIOKIT Engineering Construction Kit and the PERI UP Scaffolding Kit as a basis. It was 40m long, 25m wide and up to 12m high – and weighed just under 500 tonnes. The construction process was carried out entirely in 3D.
With an integrated hydraulics system, the entire formwork carriage could be lowered by 2.20m for striking and repositioning. Between the V-shaped columns, the Peri solution was made up of six individual carriages that could be separated for relocation and striking."
17 February 2023,How are construction OEMs adapting to the circular economy?,"Towards the end of 2021, Sarah Jones, managing director of UK-based plant hire firm Stokey, began exploring the options for replacing the company’s venerable Caterpillar D9 bulldozer which the company had originally bought 14 years earlier and which had clocked up 22,000 machine hours working in quarries around the British Midlands.
Keen to ensure that customers avoided the chances of breakdowns associated with older machines, at first the company had planned to replace the tracked 50,000kg machine with a newer version and either sell off or scrap the old one.
But, inspired by a growing trend in business to reduce carbon emissions and improve its impact on the environment – as well as a wish to cut costs – Jones, like a growing number of other customers, chose to get local Caterpillar dealer Finning to strip down and rebuild the machine instead, replacing the worn parts with used ones which had been returned to a Cat factory and restored or ‘remanufactured’.
Stokey’s decision to choose a certified powertrain (CPT) rebuild, which includes replacing the transmission, engine, differential and final drives with remanufactured alternatives where possible, saved the customer a cool £550,000 compared with the costs of buying a new machine and saved the planet thousands of tonnes of carbon in terms of the energy and resources.
“We’re giving an old machine a completely new lease of life instead of sending it off for resale or worse still, to be broken down and scrapped,” Jones says, posing proudly with the rebuilt machine and sporting a hard hat and hi-vis orange jacket.
Of course, re-using, repairing and reconditioning expensive machinery is nothing new in the construction equipment industry. Independent repair shops, equipment dealers and manufacturers have been offering various levels of repair for well over a century.
But in recent years firms have started taking what has become an industry norm and making a direct connection with meeting company-wide sustainability objectives. Organisations can gain faster near-term value from bringing back existing products and reusing them and incorporating innovations that help achieve net zero and net neutral goals across supply chains.
Caterpillar’s dealers have been running a certified rebuilds programme since 1985, carrying out on each machine over 350 tests and examining 7,000 parts to provide customers with a like-new machine, complete with Cat warranty.
Certified Rebuilds
Mark Holden, product support account manager at Finning UK & Ireland, says that by re-using the most hard-wearing parts of the machine and replacing only the parts which needed it, Stokey’s rebuild cost the company £300,000 (€339,500) compared with the £850,000 o buy a new equivalent D9 dozer. And the rebuilt dozer also costs the planet less in terms of the amount of raw materials and carbon used to make it.
“While the engine, transmission and other key components will eventually need replacing before they fail and cause operational issues, the main chassis and body of the machine is structurally sound so can be stripped back and restored to its former glory and used again and again,” he says.
The Stokey rebuild
In the case of Stokey’s D9 bulldozer rebuild, the entire process lasted from April until June 2022, starting with a pre-repair inspection carried out by Finning lead service engineer Lane Armstrong and was followed by a month-long workshop strip down during which two engineers painstakingly disassembled all external and internal components and sorted through them.
A third stage comprises an in-depth inspection of the machine, looking along the chassis, inspecting the state of the hose work and identifying any damage to the mounts or brakes.
Only after this are the technicians able to provide a recommendation for a full scope of work required and provide a cost and timetable to the customer.
Once agreed, service controller Simon Benton then oversaw the project, ordering in the major components including a remanufactured engine from Caterpillar as well as using Finning service exchange units for components such as final drive units.

Remanufacturing is becoming more and more important within the sustainability goals of OEMs and their dealers.
It means that rather than replacing the D9’s worn engine with a new one, taking up more valuable material and resources, engineers can get hold of a used engine from a previous customer which has been shipped back to the manufacturer and restored to original factory conditions before being returned to the dealer and re-sold at a cheaper price than a new one but offering the same performance and with a manufacturer’s warranty to match.
As well as being the world’s largest construction equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar is also one of the world’s largest remanufacturers, officially offering the service since 1973. And before that, the company boasts that it has been carrying out refurbishments and repairs. It points out that one of the original tractors built by Cat’s predecessor company, Holt Manufacturing Company in 1917, is still in operation today. Components can be remanufactured up to six times.
What is remanufacturing?
Over the last 40 years Cat says its dealers have rebuilt an estimated 37,000 machines, powertrains and components and in 2021 alone they returned 127 million pounds of material to Cat remanufacturing facilities for processing. The sales price of Cat Reman products includes a ‘core deposit’ worth around the same as the value of the materials themselves, which the manufacturer says provides an economic incentive to eventually return the component.
In 2021 the company announced a sustainability goal to increase sales and revenue from Cat Reman by 25% by 2030 from 2018 levels.
The reasons behind this are both environmental and strategic.
Cat says that restoring a cylinder head to factory conditions requires 85% less energy than manufacturing a new one, generating 61% fewer greenhouse gasses. It also uses 86% less water and requires 85% less material. Remanufactured engines are sent to dealers who then use them as part of a comprehensive rebuild.
Moreover, the company estimates that around 35% of its costs lie in overheads, while the majority (65%) are materials costs. So salvaging materials gives a greater business advantage for the company over its competitors.
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity set up by the former British yachtswoman to promote the circular economy, singles out both Caterpillar and aerial platform manufacturer JLG as examples of companies which are successfully moving towards a circular economy by adopting innovative business models.
The foundation cites Caterpillar for providing customers with “multiple product life extension options,” including remanufacturing, rebuilding and second-hand sales.
“The circular economy framework places emphasis on the importance of designing effective products and systems rather than aiming solely for efficiency.
“Caterpillar have employed this strategy in their own product design, and rather than aiming to use less and less material, increasing amounts of consideration goes into creating a product that is intended to be remanufactured a number of times,” the foundation says.
Cat boasts that its equipment is ‘built to be rebuilt’. One of its most cited examples is an engine block with a removable sleeve in the cylinder bore. When the component is recovered, this material can be removed and replaced to return the engine to as-new performance. Previous techniques for remanufacturing engine blocks have involved re-boring the engine cylinder and using a larger piston, but this can only be done up to three times before the quality of the product is affected.
And it’s not just Caterpillar which has big plans to harness the circular economy more. Other manufacturers have also recently announced ambitious growth targets for their own remanufacturing and rebuilding operations.
Volvo Construction Equipment has a target of increasing its remanufacturing business by 60% by 2025 compared with a 2018 baseline. The company also says it expects to see a big growth in its certified rebuilds, driven by sustainability goals, cost-saving initiatives and by the recent supply chain crisis which has made it difficult to get hold of new machines.
Harnessing the circular economy
“We expect to see a significant increase in the number of certified rebuilds carried out in 2023 compared to 2022,” says Hilton Wood, Pennsylvania-based product manager for sales development and aftermarket products and services at Volvo CE. Compared with previous years, rebuilds are receiving more attention and quoting activity is increasing due to tight availability and high demand for machines. An added benefit is the sustainability aspect.”
Hitachi Construction Machinery too reports that customers are increasingly considering refurbishing their own equipment. The company has remanufacturing facilities in 21 locations around the world in ten countries, employing approximately 400 people.
“Cost is undoubtedly a main driver but we are noticing an increasing interest in the circular economy, especially in Scandinavian countries,” says Rob Feskens, parts sales representative at Hitachi Construction Machinery.
“This is often stimulated and driven by government regulations put in place to encourage contractors to work in a more environmentally and sustainable manner.”
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation praises JLG’s partnership with finance company DLL which encourages customers to return equipment to JLG at the end of their lease contracts, allowing JLG to plan and predict when assets will reach its workshop for reconditioning.
“JLG’s reconditioned business pipeline for 2023 is very strong,” says Chris Mellott, VP of sales & service at JLG. “Since the program launched in 1997, it has grown through all economic conditions, regardless of the market conditions (supply chain constraints, looming recession, etc).”
Manufacturers are also highlighting retrofitting services too as another way of extending the life of machinery whilst also reducing carbon emissions.
In February, French OEM Manitou announced that it had signed a deal with rental company Kiloutou to investigate retrofit electrification kits for the manufacturer’s diesel-powered telehandlers. The kits, which will comprise lithium-ion batteries, will open the door to switching from internal combustion to low carbon full electric motors.
“The possibility of giving machines in our fleet a second life, and lowering their emissions, is a key lever in our drive to reduce our indirect emissions,” said François Renault, group fleet and sustainability director of Kiloutou Group. “We are working particularly hard these days to fast track this circular economy solution.”
Extending the life of construction equipment
German construction equipment manufacturer Liebherr reports a similar trend. “Since 2022, we have noticed an increase in customer requests for upgrades and overhauls,” says Wolfgang Pfister, head of strategic marketing and communications at Liebherr.
“What is striking is that customers are looking to apply their machines for a wider range of operations. To stay competitive, our customers require more versatile and multi-purpose machines. The current train of thought is definitely also heading towards longevity and sustainability. The global awareness of green thinking is constantly growing.”
Yet, despite these grand sounding plans, some remain sceptical whether growing remanufacturing businesses is achievable – or even desirable – for OEMs.
One of the key reasons for this is that current rebuilding and remanufacturing practices are highly people intensive. Although much of the construction process for new machinery is automated and done by robotics, disassembly is still done by hand, with engineers inspecting each piece to decide which can be re-used or salvaged for remanufacture and which can only be scrapped.
The nature of the process means that remanufacturing is only currently profitable for the most valuable components such as steel engine components or gears. Even amongst this group, not all components are suitable for remanufacturing, with many too worn or degraded to be considered worthwhile repairing.
Liebherr estimates that remanufacturing results in savings in material of between 75% and 78%, resulting in a reduction in the carbon footprint of a crankshaft by 66% and a crankcase by 61%.
However, the researchers calculate that when rejects are taken into account, the reductions in carbon footprint for both remanufactured elements falls to around half that of its newly manufactured equivalent.
Similarly, the actual remanufacturing processes can also be inefficient and carbon intensive, with cast iron components often requiring welding at pre-heat temperatures greater than 315°C.
And, with most manufacturers only using a few facilities to provide the service globally, many heavy components must be transported long distances, which also adds to their carbon footprint.
Remanufacturing research projects
In order to find ways to increase the amount of material which can easily be remanufactured - and more effective and energy efficient ways of doing it - OEMs and governments are investing heavily in research and development.
The REMADE Institute, a public-private partnership established by the US department of Energy as well as OEMs including Caterpillar, John Deere, Michelin and Nike and academic research institutions such as MIT, Rochester Institute of Technology and Yale, has since 2017 handed out millions of dollars in research grants aimed at looking at just these issues.
Current projects include working with remanufacturing firms to come up with a set of design guidelines which would allow design engineers to integrate remanufacturing considerations into their components in the first place, as well as using machine learning techniques to recognise different types of component damage and to develop a real-time estimate of remanufacturing costs.
Researchers in the Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Pittsburgh are collaborating with Caterpillar on a wide range of projects aimed at increasing the proportion of worn steel components which can be remanufactured such as developing high-tech practical repair techniques to relieve stress in components which are currently unusable and using high speed laser cladding for remanufactured crankshafts and camshafts which is expected to increase the reuse rate from 70% to 95%. The partners are also developing a robust weld repair process that can be achieved at lower temperatures.
Furthermore, the institute is funding research aimed at increasing the range of materials which can be repaired or remanufactured. These include using micro abrasion techniques or laser abrasion to remove the potting material surrounding circuit boards and using automated methods to detect solder joint and interconnection failures on used electronics.
And yet, despite all of this, remanufacturing comprises just a fraction of the business, with most OEMs firmly focused on the more lucrative process of making and selling machines.
Caterpillar’s goal to increase sales and revenue from Cat Reman by 25% by 2030 from 2018 levels comes after the company came short on a previous sustainability goal to grow remanufacturing revenue by 20% from 2013 to 2020 – something the company explained on a fall in overall demand during the first year of the Covid pandemic and on the company’s decision to stop manufacturing on-highway truck engines. The company does not disclose separate remanufacturing revenues.
Agricultural and construction equipment maker Deere & Co, which does disclose the figures from its remanufacturing division, said that revenues stood at $360.4m in 2021 – less than 1% of the company total during the period.
Under Deere’s latest sustainability targets, it plans to grow that figure by 50% to reach $540.6m by 2030. Progress so far is modest: in 2022, the company said revenues from the division grew by 2% to £367.6m.
Bert Avezaat, director of Dutch crane repair specialist Avezaat which specialises in repairing cranes from any manufacturer, says that although the demand for repairs, rebuilds and remanufacturing is getting stronger, businesses like his see little in terms of competition from OEMs who are mostly still concerned with a linear economy model of manufacturing and selling as many new machines as possible for profit.
“In general, the OEMs are more focused on supplying new cranes or parts,” he says. “They carry out repairs but it is not their main business.”
Manufacturers’ focus is still the linear economy
Some customers also remain wary of remanufactured products, preferring the reassurance and prestige of a new product. According to Alexander Pajari, product support director for Volvo CE, raising awareness of the remanufacturing process is a challenge for the manufacturer in China, for example, where any second hand items are traditionally viewed with suspicion.
Moreover, some may worry that by focusing so much on remanufacturing successes in their sustainability goals, OEMs may distract attention from setting goals to cut their own significant carbon footprints. Manufacturers are coming under increasing pressure to slash emissions in line with the Paris Agreement – a process which is likely to cause significant disruption to current working practices.
But back at Finning’s workshop in the West Midlands, Stokey’s Sarah Jones has been converted.
“This experience has certainly opened our eyes to the prospect of considering more rebuilds – both in terms of the financial gains over replacing with a new machine, but with sustainability in mind as well,” she says."

‘The Spin’ is one of three high-rise buildings that have now been erected on Güterplatz. The 32-storey high-rise, designed by architect Hadi Teherani, offers space for a premium hotel, offices and a roof terrace.
With a final hook height of approximately 180m, Liebherr said that the luffing jib crane was the tallest crane on the project in Frankfurt – and also the last remaining crane on site.
Liebherr’s Tower Crane Solutions project department started planning the dismantling of the 230 HC-L 8/16 five years ago. To ensure a smooth climb down, the crane, with its radius of 55 metres, had to be able to negotiate the new hotel and office tower without colliding with it. Furthermore, it needed to do so along a façade with multiple projections.
The upper storeys are each at a slightly rotated angle compared to the lower ones so that the 128-metre-high tower doesn’t have a uniform, smooth-running exterior said Liebherr.


The company added that the cranes assisted in the construction of the tower and the development of its surroundings. Featuring intelligent assistance systems, such as the Micromove fine positioning mode, the Liebherr cranes were said to have mainly helped with concreting, formwork and façade-related tasks.
The Spin Tower is scheduled to open in spring 2023."
09 January 2023,Liebherr diesel excavators converted to hydrogen,"



Hydrogen fuel cell system manufacturer Zepp.solutions has converted a pair of Liebherr 916 Litronic wheeled excavators from diesel to hydrogen-electric power.
The company says it is the first time it has undertaken such as conversion in the construction industry.
As well as the fuel cell system, the two machines have on board hydrogen storage systems, also developed by Zepp, which has previously provided hydrogen power technology to vehicle manufacturers, shipyards and OEMs.
Zepp said both machines have now undergone six months of testing in the field, via Dutch contracting company Jos Scholman – which already owned the diesel versions – with the conversion having no detrimental effect on their performance.
The kit used to convert the machines was developed by Dutch firm Terberg Techniek, which said the technology can be used to convert other construction equipment from diesel to hydrogen-electric powertrains.
Kevin Schreiber, co-founder of zepp.solutions, said, “We are thrilled to see our fuel cell systems being used in the conversion of these Liebherr excavators, and to play a role in helping the construction equipment sector reduce its carbon emissions.
“At zepp.solutions, we are committed to providing innovative, reliable, and cost-effective fuel cell technology to a wide range of industries, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with Terberg Techniek on future projects.”"
05 January 2023,Liebherr excavators converted to hydrogen,"The company zepp solutions has converted two Liebherr 916 Litronic wheeled excavators from diesel to hydrogen-electric, the first application of zepp’s fuel cell systems in the construction equipment industry.
The two excavators, both owned by Dutch contracting company Jos Scholman, have undergone six months of operational testing. It is reported that the results show that the excavators perform as expected, offering an environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional diesel-powered models as they produce no emissions other than water.
Both the fuel cell system and onboard hydrogen storage system were developed by zepp solutions and the company Terberg Techniek, which developed a conversion kit surrounding zepp’s fuel cell systems. Use of this kit is not limited to this type of excavator and Terberg Techniek says that it plans to use it to convert other construction equipment from a diesel to a hydrogen-electric powertrain.
Alternative powered equipment is gaining in popularity in the construction industry, although the numbers sold are still low.
“We are thrilled to see our fuel cell systems being used in the conversion of these Liebherr excavators, and to play a role in helping the construction equipment sector reduce its carbon emissions,” said Kevin Schreiber, co-founder of zepp."
14 December 2022,What climate pledges are being made in construction?,"With a couple of clicks of his computer keyboard, Marius Verwoerd, VP for Sustainability at Finnish mining equipment manufacturer Metso Outotec scrolls through a series of charts on the company website to show the carbon emissions.
In 2021, Metso produced 52,216 tonnes of carbon dioxide from its own operations, an increase of 14% from the 44,913 tonnes in 2020, but down 58% compared with 2019. This was mostly achieved, Verwoerd says, by switching energy sources from fossil fuels to renewables or renewable energy certificates where that isn’t possible.
That, he says, is keeping the company on track to meet its latest emissions reduction targets, set by the company in 2021, promising to halve CO2 output compared with 2019 levels and to ‘net zero’ by 2030.
Net zero is the point at which the amount of carbon emissions produced by the company will be so low it will be balanced out by the amount it removes from the atmosphere.
“Yes we are on track to reach our target,”Verwoerd says confidently. “We have quite a long history of setting climate related emissions targets in the company.
“We are also clear about what the next steps between now and 2030 will be. We have a company-wide roadmap for how we plan to achieve our target.”
And Metso is far from alone. More construction organisations than ever are signing up to ambitious climate pledges to reduce their carbon footprints as companies around the world face unprecedented pressure from customers, employees, shareholders and lenders to operate in a more environmentally sustainable manner.
An International Construction analysis of the sustainability reports produced by a selection of 50 of the world’s biggest contractors, construction equipment OEMs and rental companies, found that nearly all of them had made some sort of commitment to reducing emissions and improving their impact on the environment – see the box below for the full list.
Encouragingly, there are signs that these efforts are bearing fruit. Research from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), a UN-backed organisation which has become the gold standard in assessing corporate climate pledges, found that companies with approved targets collectively reduced direct emissions by 12% in 2020.
Even taking into account the effect of the Covid pandemic during this time, the organisation reported that SBTi companies have delivered “excess reductions in comparison to their peers within their countries.”
However, there are still big caveats.
At the COP27 climate change summit in Egypt this year, the UN climate science panel reported that global CO2 emissions are on track to increase by around 1% this year, making it even harder for the world to avoid disastrous levels of climate change.
Although much of the blame for this rests with world governments, the fact remains that many of the world’s biggest emitters have yet to sign up to a voluntary agreement.
Moreover, delegates heard that many of the corporate pledges which have been made are either not ambitious enough, or are not being implemented – leaving companies open to allegations of ‘greenwashing’.
“Despite [the] growing [number of] pledges of climate action, global emissions are at an all time high and they continue to rise,” UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres told the conference. “To avert a climate catastrophe, we need bold pledges but matched by concrete, measurable action.”
For a start, although many companies have pledged to cut emissions, fewer of these have agreed to become net zero within an agreed time frame. Of the 50 companies surveyed by International Construction, around half had published a specific commitment to become net zero. Moreover, there was a significant variation over the timescales by which the companies surveyed hoped to achieve net zero.
Just two – Metso Outotec and Canadian engineering company SNC Lavalin Group – stated an aim of becoming net zero by 2030. Swedish vehicle and equipment manufacturers Scania and Volvo Group, said that they aimed to become net zero by 2040, while another 15 explicitly said that they would become net zero by 2050 – the year by which the UN says global emissions must fall by almost 50% to keep global temperature rises to a 1.5ᵒC target.
A UN commission convened to assess the robustness of these corporate climate pledges, chaired by Catherine McKenna, a former Canadian minister of environment and climate change, found that even amongst those firms which had made a commitment to net zero, progress on emissions reduction was patchy and difficult to assess.
According to McKenna’s report, delivering on net zero requires three key measures.
Firstly, putting in place short, medium and long term plans to show how they will achieve their goal.
Secondly, focussing on reducing their own emissions as much as possible rather than buying carbon credits to offset their emissions.
Finally, addressing carbon emissions across their entire value chain – the ones produced by suppliers and customers – as well as the ones caused by their own operations.
“If you’re saying to the world ‘I am net zero’ then there is a price of admission,” McKenna told the conference. “You need to walk the talk. You need to deliver on it.”
One way in which many companies are attempting to put clear plans in place is by joining the SBTi, an initiative led by the UN Global Compact and involving a partnership of ‘green’ organisations and charities such as WWF, CDP and the World Resources Initiative.
The initiative works with businesses around the world to agree science-based target that limits a business’s global share of greenhouse gas emissions.
The initiative has quickly grown to become the gold standard for independently-verified corporate emissions targets with more than 4,000 businesses around the world already signed up, including 22 of those surveyed by International Construction.
Karl Downey, senior technical manager at the SBTi says that the organisation helps each individual company set meaningful emissions targets by assessing current emissions levels and plans to reduce them compared with those of industry peers.
Then, using a computer algorithm to work out how the proposed cuts would tie in with global emissions targets to keep warming to well below the 2ᵒC (or preferably 1.5ᵒC) above pre-industrial levels proposed in the Paris Climate Agreement.
Downey says that although the SBTi is unable to check whether companies are telling the truth about their emissions or sticking to their plans once they have set them, the initiative is important because it adds to the pressure corporates are facing to make meaningful changes to their operations.
“For the construction sector, the technology to enable companies to make these emissions cuts is already there,” Downey says. “The challenge we face is that the sector is so fragmented that we need to get lots of different individuals to each cut their emissions.”
Echoing McKenna’s second point, Downey says that the biggest problem his organisation comes up against in the construction sector when attempting to agree corporate climate pledges is the number of companies who propose that, rather than cutting their own carbon emissions, they plan to reduce their overall carbon footprint by investing in ventures such as renewable energy projects or tree planting - known as carbon offsets.
“We see a number of attempts at greenwashing but offsetting is definitely the biggest one,” Downey says.
“We are against using offsets as a way of meeting corporate targets, although we do say that of course companies can finance additional emissions reductions beyond their science-based target or net zero target.”
Some environmentalists go further, pointing out that tree planting events and the like have poor success rates and can even have a detrimental effect on the environments they are supposed to help.
“Carbon offsets mean climate sabotage,” Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International told the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021.
“They aren’t just a tool to greenwash climate inaction and delay the transformation we need, they’re also going to drive devastating land grabs in the Global South.”
Other ways companies attempt to manipulate their emissions targets, says SBTi’s Karl Downey, include choosing an atypical base year from which to measure their emissions reductions, or by attempting to make their emissions cuts sound bigger by calculating tonnes of CO2 emitted per US$1m of company sales.
“These figures can provide a useful way of looking at corporate emissions but overall we need to see total carbon emissions,” he says.
Claire Danamur, a sustainability analyst at ESG ratings agency EcoVadis, says that, although most large companies in the construction industry in Europe are capable of producing detailed and reliable information about the carbon emissions they produce through their own operations (scope 1 emissions) or the energy they buy from outside sources (scope 2).
Many face significant challenges when assessing scope 3 emissions - the greenhouse gasses produced by both the company’s suppliers and its customers. (In the case of equipment rental businesses, scope 3 emissions would include the carbon emitted by their machines when used by customers.)
“Some 20-50% of a building’s lifetime emissions take place during the construction phase,” Danamur says. “Every project is unique and involves a team of engineers, architects, consultants, suppliers and subcontractors that may not have worked together before.
“Furthermore, building materials are often sourced from global markets where labour and occupational health standards vary. This makes it challenging for global construction firms to account for all actors within their value chain.”
In the International Construction survey, only 20 of the 50 companies surveyed made any mention at all of scope 3 emissions at all in their climate pledges.
Downey says the SBTi is developing specific methodologies and guidance for some companies in the building sector which will require them to make greater scope 3 emissions cuts than average to account for a predicted 75% growth in the floor area of buildings between 2020 and 2050.
Back at Metso, Marius Verwoerd says that one of the ways his company aims to ensure it is working towards hitting its carbon reduction targets is by regularly publishing detailed data about a range of sustainability metrics including scope 1,2 and 3 emissions, the amount of water it uses and the amount of energy it consumes.
For president and CEO Pekka Vaurramo to receive his full share bonus in 2024, the Metso Outotec board has stipulated that one of the key performance metrics, carrying a weighting of 10%, is that the company must achieve its carbon emissions improvement target of reducing scope one and two CO2 output by 50% compared with 2019.
“In our company where sustainability is linked to our management’s renumeration and to our finance arrangements, as well as externally verified, we consider sustainability data as important as any other data in the company,” Verwoerd says.
“The more companies embed sustainability into their business models, and the more regulators ensure that regulations related to sustainability reporting push companies to be precise and open about their sustainability actions and data, the less likely ‘greenwashing’ will become.”
Yet with the wave of climate pledges made following the COP26 summit last year followed by a number of lawsuits about greenwashing in advertising campaigns, many firms are choosing not to publicise the details of their climate goals in an effort to avoid scrutiny and allegations of greenwashing.
A study of 1,200 companies by UK-based climate consultancy South Pole, found that although corporates are setting more net zero goals than ever before, with more science based goals to back them up and to more ambitious timelines, around a quarter said that they planned not to announce these targets to the public – a process it describes as ‘greenhushing.’
“More than ever we need the companies making progress on sustainability to inspire their peers and make a start,” says Renat Heuberger, CEO of South Pole. “This is impossible if progress is happening in silence.”
Critics also point out that the current voluntary system of emissions reporting and reduction includes no way to ensure that companies stick to the targets they have set themselves.
Even independent third party organisations like SBTi have faced criticism of potential conflicts of interest over the fact that they charge companies a $9,500 fee to assess their climate goals – funding which the SBTi’s Downey says makes up “only a small proportion of the organisation’s funding,” and about which it is “very transparent.”
“It’s tough to go and figure out who’s greenwashing and who’s not,” said Al Halvorsen, Vice President of ESG at Sunbelt Rentals, a subsidiary of the UK-based Ashtead Group, speaking at the Access, Lift & Handlers conference in Chicago, earlier this year. “There are companies that go out and set very aggressive goals, don’t reach their goal, and then five years later they set another aggressive goal.
“You look at the transparency of the company and if companies are honest in saying, ‘here are our challenges, here’s our performance’, and they don’t try to hide some of the faults that they have, I would say that would be a sign of somebody maybe who is not greenwashing. If you hear somebody making claims that they can’t or won’t back up – that would raise a flag to say, I wonder if that’s true or not.”
To combat this, the UN High Level Expert Group on Net Zero Emissions Commitments’ top recommendation is for governments around the world to introduce regulations and standards in areas including net zero pledges, transition plans and disclosures in order to ensure that companies are both consistent and transparent about their emissions.
“Voluntary schemes are not enough,” the UN’s Catherine McKenna said. “Regulation will be essential here, both to ensure that voluntary climate roadmaps are replaced by mandatory strategies and to level the playing field.
“If we are to avoid a future where our children are buying ‘net zero’ bacon between floods and fires, we must close the gap between the promises we hear and the action we need.”

12 December 2022,Bauma 2022: In pictures,"It was three (and a half) long years in the making, but when the Bauma Munich construction trade fair finally arrived, it was worth the wait.
In fact, the days between 24 and 30 October flew by.

The show’s organiser Messe München said more than 495,000 visitors attended the show from October 24-30, with around 50% being international visitors.

These figures may be down on the 2019 event, but – given there were almost no visitors at all from China, and worldwide travel is still well short of pre-Covid levels – it certainly felt like things were returning to normal (or at least the new normal).

The show featured the latest in diesel and electric powered construction equipment, as well as hydrogen fuel and digital technology innovations, which were exhibited by some 3,200 exhibitors from 60 countries.
Here, in pictures, is a flavour of the new equipment we were treated to in Munich.
Through its dealer Zeppelin, Cat brought four electric debutants to Bauma, including the 320 excavator – a 20 tonne machine. So, who says battery-power is only suitable for compact equipment?


Professor Sebastian Bauer (pictured below), who directs research and development at Bauer Maschinen, gave a tour of the Bauer Maschinen stand, which included the innovative Cube System.
The OEM developed the system that allows the excavation of underground railway stations or logistics centres in the centre of cities and other urban environments.

The foundation specialist also showed visitors the 120 tonne MC 96 duty cycle crane, which can be used to undertake a wide range of foundation engineering processes


Utilities equipment specialist Ditch Witch brought an enormous HDD rig into one of the Bauma halls, saying it was the world’s largest, in terms of all terrain models.
The US-based firm said the machine’s torque represented an increase of 50% over its smaller predecessor.

Wearing a new black livery – we found another large HDD rig, this one from Tracto.
The manufacturer says its new Grundodrill ACS300 is the most powerful rock drilling rig in its class, with a powerful engine, a large drill rod magazine and the capacity to drill in all geologies, including solid rock.

The distinctive orange livery of Doosan was on show at Bauma, as was its largest ever excavator, the 80 tonne DX800LC-7.
Powered by the new stage V Perkins 2506J diesel engine, the mighty machine promises increased productivity and lower fuel consumption during heavy applications.

Another major OEM famed for its orange paintwork, Hitachi, offered visitors the opportunity of climbing aboard its new ZW250 wheeled loader

Visitors to Liebherr’s technology hub were treated to a glimpse into the future of construction, with exhibits including the OEM’s H966 hydrogen engine concept.

Another giant of the industry, the John Deere-owned Wirtgen Group, manufacturers the A to Z of road construction equipment. Milling machines are at the heart of the segment and of the Bauma stand.
We took a shine to the compact W 100 Fi, which boasts features usually associated with Wirtgen’s larger machines.

On Wirtgen’s Vögele booth, one of the standout new machines was the Super 1900-5i paver, which is designed for use on highways and other demanding large-scale projects. It can pave widths between 2.55m and 11.5m.
Alex Dahm, editor of our sister title International Cranes and Specialized Transport, caught up with a huge number of manufacturers at the show.
Below is a small selection of the new and innovative equipment he discovered in Munich…
Grove showed a hybrid four axle all terrain crane. The GMK4100L-2 Plug-In Hybrid Concept is a 100 tonne capacity model with electrically driven superstructure.

Faymonville took its 1,000 tonne-metre rated BladeMax wind turbine rotor blade adaptor to Bauma.


The first showing of Link-Belt’s 120 US ton (110 tonne) capacity model 120|TT telescopic truck terrain crane earned the firm a lot of positive feedback.

Raimondi’s new T187 and T357 tower cranes were shown at Bauma alongside the new Lumina X operator cabin, all presented in the new dark grey and white colour scheme with the new logo. Modularity with multiple application of components is a key theme of the new series

12 December 2022,What are the stages of autonomy?,"Automation in construction is designed to produce higher production rates, improve project delivery times, as well as create better health and safety measures. A degree of automation – also known as machine control – has been in use in construction for decades.
Autonomous vehicles are operated by means of LiDAR sensors detecting obstacles in the surroundings, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and global positioning system (GPS) technology. This technology allows the vehicles to know their exact position on site, and a geofence is often used to prohibit the vehicles from operating off-site. A number of equipment manufacturers are including automation in the design of their vehicles, whilst construction technology companies are developing ways to enhance current fleets.
The human completely controls the equipment, be it a wheeled loader or an excavator. The human steers, brakes, and accelerates.
Under certain conditions, the machine controls either the steering or the vehicle speed, but not both simultaneously. At the same time, the operator performs all other aspects of driving and has full responsibility for monitoring the surrounding area and taking over if the assistance system fails to act appropriately.
Liebherr says that its new assistance systems for XPower large wheeled loaders increase comfort and safety in daily operation in a range of ways. The company says that one of its advantages is that they enable machine operators to concentrate more on operating their Liebherr wheel loader by removing additional distractions.
At this level, the machine can steer, accelerate and brake in certain circumstances. The operator will still need to perform tactical manoeuvres such as scanning for hazards.
The machine can manage most aspects of driving, including monitoring the environment. The system will request the operator to intervene when it encounters a scenario it can’t navigate, meaning the driver must still pay attention and be ready to take over at any time.
No human input or oversight is required except under select conditions defined by factors such as road type or geographic area (like poor weather or other unusual environments).
High automation allows companies to enhance safety in hazardous work environments, such as in the mining or quarrying industries, whilst also increasing productivity. Cat Command technologies by Caterpillar allow operators to use remote solutions, via onboard electronic and vision systems, to allow machines to be controlled without anyone in the cab.
The machine can operate on any road and in any conditions a human driver could negotiate. The system is navigated via an app or online system that will tell the machine what it should be doing. This level of automation is considered to be a long way off for construction.
In an interview with International Construction magazine, Trackunit CEO, Soeren Brogaard, said, “We are very far away from autonomous systems where AI can ultimately augment a human being… clearly, AI is coming. AI is an element that we all have to be part of. I think you’ll see it on expensive machines where each little component just starts getting more and more utility, so you cannot misuse it, or it cannot be of danger. But doing it at large construction sites with multiple systems; I wish it would happen in our lifetime, but I doubt it.”
To drive the development of autonomous transport solutions across the company, at the beginning of 2020, Volvo Group established the Volvo Autonomous Solutions business unit.
“Our approach is to start in a narrowly defined environment and build on the successes achieved there over time,” says Perjohan Rosdahl, Head of Off-Road at Volvo Autonomous Solutions. Rosdahl adds, “A perfect place for this is in quarries, which have clearly defined loading and unloading locations over generally short distances.”
The company’s autonomous and electrically powered load carrier TA15 uses GPS, lidar, radar and multiple sensors. Since the innovative vehicle does not require a driver, it comes without a cabin, enabling a completely new machine profile. According to Rosdahl, the next step could be the use of autonomous Volvo construction machines in underground mining and tunnels."
