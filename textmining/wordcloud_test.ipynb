      "['In Q1, 2023, Volvo CE has secured good profitability and a boost to its operating margin with continued demand in large infrastructure and construction projects – particularly in North America and Europe – while increasing its own investments into the biggest technological shift in the industry’s history. \\r\\n\\r\\nCompared to the same period last year, Volvo CE is reporting a strong boost in sales of 17% in Europe and 37% in North America. This is more than compensating for a dip in sales in Asia and South America where investment levels have slowed down. With the exception of China, activity in the construction industry has continued to be good across most markets, driven primarily by ongoing infrastructure investments and by the mining industry, which benefits from continued good commodity prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “Strong profitability and robust sales like the kind we see this quarter is of course important to us and is a testament to the great products and service solutions we continue to bring to the market. But these results also allow us to maintain our industry lead in the sustainable transformation, increasing our investments into zero emission solutions and demonstrating innovative partnerships in what is no doubt the biggest technological shift ever to happen in our industry.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first quarter this year, Volvo CE increased net sales by 11% to SEK 25,109 M from SEK 22,613 M in Q1, 2022 – with the majority coming from machine sales, while service sales remained flat. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 4,587 M (from SEK 2,810 M), corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 18.3%, way up from 12.4% last year. Operating income was positively impacted by a favorable brand and product mix, minimally offset by lower volumes, increased material costs and R&D expenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite net order intake declining this quarter – heavily impacted by an anticipated drop in China following the pre-buy effect of the emissions regulations change that came in at the end of last year – it was North America that saw the most significant increase of 107% driven by a favorable market outlook. Deliveries in China and Brazil slowed down, while deliveries in North America and Europe, excluding the stopped sales in Russia, increased.\\r\\nMARKET DEVELOPMENT\\r\\nOverall, demand in major markets outside China remained stable this Q1, with notable growth in North America, where many large infrastructure projects and strong commercial construction more than offset a weakness in residential construction amid high interest rates, and in Europe, where construction activity was positively influenced by rental fleet replacements. In South America however, investment levels slowed due to lower business confidence among customers in Brazil. Development in Asia remained flat, due in part to the Chinese market reporting a significant negative correction due to the pre-buy effect of emissions regulations and low economic activity.\\r\\nWhile there was fluctuation across the regions, Volvo CE’s global investment into sustainable power solutions continued this quarter – including milestone investments into battery pack production at its excavator plant in Changwon, South Korea and into electric wheel loaders at its Arvika facility in Sweden.\\r\\nAmong the launches already this year was the L120H Electric Conversation wheel loader, fulfilling market appetite for more sustainable solutions in the mid-size range. The introduction of electric products in new markets continued, with a notable launch of the zero-emission EC55 Electric excavator in India.\\r\\nAnother significant success this quarter was the CONEXPO trade show in Las Vegas in March, where Volvo CE launched a range of new service offerings in North America such as Connected Map, Task Manager and Global Load Out solutions, all designed to increase connectivity, productivity and sustainability in work site solutions. The event also marked the handover of the first articulated hauler made from fossil-free steel in North America to a customer, CRH (pictured).\\r\\nTable 1. Volvo Construction Equipment, net sales by market area, in Millions of Swedish Krona', 'Kamel, who has held the position of acting Head of Operations since last September when Jean Marc des Courieres retired from the position, is responsible for the smooth running, efficiency, quality and output of Volvo CE’s global operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe says: “I am thrilled to continue working with our many passionate and committed colleagues in Operations and together drive our transformation agenda.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMelker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, adds: “After six months as acting Head of Operations I am delighted that Kamel has agreed to join the Executive Management Team as a permanent member.

To achieve its Science-Based Targets and reach net-zero by 2040, Volvo CE recognizes the importance of reducing its carbon footprint across its entire value chain, alongside the electrification of its machines.\\r\\nVOLVO GROUP’S JOURNEY TOWARDS FOSSIL-FREE STEEL\\r\\nIn October 2021, Volvo Group unveiled the world’s first vehicle made from fossil-free steel. Then in May 2022, Volvo Trucks started to introduce fossil-free steel into parts of its range. In June 2022, Volvo CE became the first manufacturer in the world to deliver a construction machine made with fossil-free steel to a customer. The company will continue to introduce production using fossil-free steel into its machines and components, dependent on aspects such as steel availability.', 'The pre-order system for the electric machines allows interested buyers to enjoy the convenience of an e-commerce tool while still getting customer support from their local Volvo CE dealer.\\r\\nThe Volvo DD25 Electric made its debut at the Las Vegas trade show and was a popular product among attendees. Roadbuilders were interested in how the machine could benefit their fleets, as were officials from government departments.\\r\\n“It’s exciting to finally get to show off this new development in our electrification efforts,” said Justin Zupanc, Head of Asphalt Compaction Development. “We’re proud to offer our customers tangible solutions for reducing their carbon footprint, and we’re thrilled to launch our first zero-emission machine for the road segment.”\\r\\nThe addition of the DD25 Electric asphalt compactor brings the Volvo CE electric lineup to six commercially available machines, with a mid-size excavator and mid-size wheel loader in the works.\\r\\nLOOKING UNDER THE HOOD\\r\\nThe electric driveline of the DD25 Electric asphalt compactor is based on the same proven architecture and components found on the Volvo CE ECR25 Electric compact excavator and L25 Electric compact wheel loader, which have been successful in a variety of different applications and markets over the past few years.\\r\\nIts zero-emission operation makes the DD25 Electric asphalt compactor ideal for sensitive or urban environments with strict emission regulations and for organizations that are looking to meet their own sustainability goals. Zero tailpipe emissions also mean a cleaner and more enjoyable work environment for operators, site teams and passers-by. If used alongside other electric powered equipment, the DD25 Electric offers the possibility of a zero-emission jobsite.\\r\\nThe DD25 Electric asphalt compactor is expected to operate for a full shift on a single charge (depending upon the type of job and intensity of the work cycle) using the same charging solutions as its forerunners, which allows customers to choose the right charger for their operation. The machine comes with an integrated on-board charger that enables charging from zero to 100% in as little as three hours, depending on AC power level. With an optional off-board DC fast charger, this can be achieved in just over an hour.\\r\\nThe double-drum DD25 Electric asphalt compactor offers 24 kW of available power, which is 30% more than the conventional Volvo DD25B compactor. The result is a more responsive machine in terms of speed and vibrations. It also performs better on grade thanks to the size of its components and better at high elevations when compared to a diesel machine, which loses power as you increase altitude.\\r\\nPre-orders opened in North America first and will expand to other regions in the future. Those who would like to reserve a DD25 Electric asphalt compactor may visit volvoce.com/united-states/en-us/products/electric-machines/reservation/.', 'The packages are designed for customers to choose their preferred levels of functionality\\r\\nDesigned for customers who need some of the existing system’s functionality – but not all of them – the new ‘Lite’ and ‘Start’ packages unlock varying degrees of access to the core functions of Pass Mapping and Compaction Measurement Value (CMV) Mapping, all powered by the 10” Volvo Co-Pilot touchscreen.

Meanwhile China, which has continued to be impacted by low economic activity last year during the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing lockdowns, saw an increase in sales and deliveries in Q4 due to the introduction of emission regulations.\\r\\nIn Q4, 2022 net sales increased by 27% to SEK 27,596 M (21,812), with a contribution from both machine sales and the service market. Adjusted for currency movements net sales increased by 13%, of which net sales of machines were up by 15% and service sales remained on a similar level. For the full year 2022, net sales rose 9% amounting to SEK 100,261 M (92,031). Adjusted operating income for the full year totaling SEK 13,244 M (12,228), and corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 13.2% (13.3).\\r\\nGlobal net order intake has continued to remain low with a decline of 23% from Q4, 2021 – although still slightly more orders than the last quarter Q3, 2022 – largely due to restrictive order slotting caused by large order books and long lead times in North America and Europe, as well as stopped sales in Russia. However, deliveries have increased by 4%, again thanks to emission regulations coming into effect in China and the good demand in North America and Asia.\\r\\nACCELERATED TRANSFORMATION\\r\\nWhile maintaining a steady financial performance, Volvo CE has continued to innovate this quarter by introducing powerful new solutions for the here and now and investing into a more sustainable future. The company is continuing to work towards its vision for zero accident worksites with the introduction of automatic braking feature Collision Mitigation System for Volvo wheel loaders.\\r\\nVolvo CE also announced a largescale investment into its facility in Braås, Sweden. Over the coming years the plant will be adapted to produce a larger range of articulated haulers with different types of powertrains, including electric. These products will join one of the largest ranges of electric machines on the market, including the Volvo electric compact wheel loaders and excavators, and the larger mid-size EC230 Electric excavator.\\r\\nMelker Jernberg, Head of Volvo CE, says: “We continue to take steps in our transformation journey – continuing to deliver reliable, efficient and more sustainable solutions fit for our customers’ needs today, while driving investment across our business towards our fossil-free future.”\\r\\nMARKET DEVELOPMENT\\r\\nExcept for China, activity in the construction industry has remained good across many regions, primarily driven by ongoing infrastructure investments and favorable commodity prices. Underlying demand in the North American market remained solid due to steady infrastructure activity and in South America, the overall market in Q4 was impacted by a slowdown of investments in Brazil. Meanwhile in Europe the market remained relatively steady despite signals of a weakening business climate.\\r\\nMost Asian markets enjoyed continued high demand for commodities, partially off-set by lower construction activity in key markets such as South Korea and Thailand. And while China was still affected by restrictions and lockdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, it did however see a positive development due to the fact pre-bought electric machine sales were coming into effect from December 1, when emission regulations were introduced.\\r\\nTable 1.

We are proud to expand our portfolio of electric machines and extend our offering to the road segment.”\\r\\nThe DD25 Electric is the first Volvo CE produced electric machine designed specifically for the asphalt industry.\\r\\nPAVING THE WAY FOR ZERO EMISSIONS\\r\\nThe electric driveline of the DD25 Electric is based upon the same proven architecture and components found on Volvo CE’s ECR25 Electric compact excavator and L25 Electric compact wheel loader - the first electric machines available for the construction market, launched in 2020 - which are proving a success in a variety of different applications and markets across the globe.\\r\\nIts zero-emission operation makes the DD25 Electric ideal for sensitive or urban environments with strict emission regulations and for organizations who are looking to meet their own sustainability goals. Zero tailpipe emissions also mean a cleaner and more enjoyable work environment for operators, site teams and passers-by. If used alongside other electric powered equipment, such as the Volvo EC18 Electric, ECR18 Electric and the ECR25 Electric compact excavators, the larger EC230 Electric excavator, or the L25 Electric and L20 Electric compact wheel loaders, the DD25 Electric offers the opportunity for a zero-emission workplace.\\r\\nExpected to operate for a full shift on a single charge depending upon the type of job and intensity of the work cycle, the DD25 Electric has the same charging solutions as its forerunners the ECR25 Electric and L25 Electric, allowing customers to choose the right solution depending on their operational requirements. The machine comes with an integrated on-board charger which enables charging from 0 to 100% in as little as three hours depending on AC power level. With an optional off-board DC fast charger this can be achieved in little over an hour, and this also offers a practical solution to top-up the machine’s charge during the lunch break.\\r\\nIts zero-emission operation makes the DD25 Electric ideal for sensitive or urban environments\\r\\nHIGH PERFORMING\\r\\nCombining the proven Volvo Asphalt Compactor platform with battery power, the DD25 Electric offers 24 kW of available power, 30% more than the conventional Volvo DD25B.

Frequency can be adjusted from 3500 vpm / 55 Hz to 4000 vpm / 67 Hz to cater for different applications.\\r\\nAnd with no engine to service - and electric components, batteries and motors all maintenance free, maintenance requirements are reduced too, saving customers time and money.\\r\\nWith the introduction of this latest electric machine, Volvo CE continues to lead the way with products and solutions to help its customers reduce their total cost of ownership and carbon footprint, while meeting its own sustainability goals.', 'The first system of its kind from any original equipment manufacturer (OEM), it assists operators while working in reverse and automatically applies service brakes when the wheel loader approaches any obstacle, alerting the operator to take further action. With wheel loaders spending an average of 40-50% of their time being driven in reverse, the Collision Mitigation System is a valuable solution for operators and site managers.\\r\\nWhile not designed to ever replace safe operator behavior, it is a smart tool to further enhance jobsite safety – a central focus and core value for Volvo CE since the company’s inception. As part of the Volvo Group, the company is committed to safety with its Zero Accident Vision which is delivered not only through its products, but also its operations.\\r\\nLars Eriksson, Global Product Manager for wheel loaders at Volvo CE says: “We at Volvo CE continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions which not only mitigate the consequences of accidents but strive to avoid them altogether. This new Collision Mitigation System is one important part of our work to reduce the risk of accidents and help fulfil our commitment towards zero accidents.”\\r\\nHOW IT WORKS\\r\\nWith this new system, customers are moving a step closer to not only eliminating accidents – and therefore improving jobsite safety for everyone – but also reducing any unplanned interruptions that can be incurred during those avoidable knocks and bumps.\\r\\nIt works by identifying when there is a risk of collision and responding by automatically activating the brakes for 2-3 seconds to slow the machine down prior to impact or bring it to a stop to avoid it. This initiation of the braking alerts the operator to intervene.\\r\\nCollision Mitigation System enhances jobsite safety.\\r\\nAnd for seamless stockpiling operations, the system will remember the last slope the machine climbed, allowing operators to reverse down a pile without activating it. It can also be temporarily deactivated for specific site conditions.\\r\\nFunctioning only when the wheel loader is in reverse and driving at speeds of between 3-15 km/h (1.86-9.32mp/h), no matter what gear it is in, it serves as a facilitator to jobsite safety. Even assistance systems like this cannot totally eliminate accidents though, which is why Volvo CE always advocates for safe operator driving behavior.\\r\\nA BOOST FOR JOBSITE SAFETY\\r\\nDeveloped in-house by Volvo CE, the patent-pending Collision Mitigation System for Volvo Wheel Loaders is a factory-fit option currently available on the L110H/L120H equipped with OptiShift, L150H, L180H, L220H, L260H and L200H High Lift wheel loaders.\\r\\nRequiring a Radar Detect System to be fitted, it works as an additional system to the existing wide range of features, options and site services provided by Volvo CE for its line of wheel loaders, all of which have been designed to elevate jobsite safety and minimize unplanned interruptions.\\r\\nCollision Mitigation System is available in all markets around the world.\\r\\nThe solution assists operators while working in reverse', 'Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is working with the City of Stockholm, construction company Skanska, Volvo CE dealer Swecon and other like-minded partners in the pioneering urban development of Stockholm city’s meat packing district.\\r\\nThe EC230 Electric, a new 23-ton battery electric excavator from Volvo CE, will play a key role in constructing the neighborhood of 3,000 homes and 14,000 workplaces – helping to build with the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions.\\r\\nAs Sweden’s largest fossil free worksite, it is set to save approximately 2,012 tons of CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 35 trucks driving about eight hours a day over one year.\\r\\nThe 100-year-old ‘Slakthusområdet’ area of Stockholm city center in Sweden, also known as the meat-packing district, will become a testbed for innovation and emission-free construction equipment as work begins on its urban transformation. Construction is set to finish in 2033 and when open to the public, it will provide 3,000 new homes and 14,000 workplaces.\\r\\nSustainability has been built in from the project’s inception with a stipulation for fossil-free contracts, including transport to and from the construction site. With a particular requirement that at least one of the larger excavators working on site should be electric, there was only one partner for the job: Volvo CE and its industry-leading range of electric construction equipment.\\r\\nWhen finished, the site will provide 3,000 homes and 14,000 workplaces\\r\\nTRANSFORMATION THROUGH ELECTRIFICATION\\r\\nThe new 23-ton EC230 Electric excavator, offered in selected markets, has already been proving its potential across a range of applications and is one of only a few mid-size electric machines commercially available. Early next year it will be put to work in Stockholm, together with a mobile peak-shaving power unit supplied by Volvo CE, to help excavate 75,000 tons of rock and 96,000 tons of soil in the first stages of the project, for an estimated 2,700 working hours.\\r\\nFredrik Tjernström, responsible for Electromobility Solutions Sales at Volvo CE, says: “Partnership is how we can accelerate our journey towards emission-free jobsites. We have powerful and reliable solutions like our EC230 Electric providing all the benefits of electric equipment: zero exhaust emissions, near silence and more comfortable operation. But it is by collaborating with partners like Skanska and the City of Stockholm, who are aligned with our mission to build a better world, that we can really drive the transformation of our industry in a much more holistic way.\"\\r\\nLisa Kroon, project manager at Skanska, says: “It is Sweden\\'s largest testbed in an urban environment for fossil-free contracting, where we will convert almost 35,000 machine hours to fossil-free. We want to challenge building standards and find new innovations, and we do this in collaboration with, among others, Volvo CE.” \\r\\n  Lisa Kroon says: “We can challenge building standards and find new innovations through collaboration”\\r\\nA TESTBED FOR INNOVATION\\r\\nInsights from the EC230 Electric’s use will not only be instrumental in helping Volvo CE build the world we want to live in through our electric solutions – providing data on factors such as productivity, cost and scalability – but will also prove useful for other partners in their ongoing ambitions to reduce climate impact through their work.\\r\\nAnders Österberg, deputy financial councillor and chairman of the exploitation committee in the City of Stockholm, says: “We want to drive the development of fossil-free contracts, and we can do that by setting tender requirements in our procurements. In the contract, where large amounts of rock and soil are to be excavated, one of the requirements is that at least 10% of the machine hours must be powered by electricity.” \\r\\nAnders Österberg: “We want to drive the deployment of fossil-free contracts”\\r\\nFredrik adds: “The type of procurement that the City of Stockholm has required for fossil-free contracts will contribute to a breakthrough in the transition to electric machines. The EC230 Electric will contribute to 2,700 fossil-free hours in the project.”\\r\\nRichard Sjöblom, Excavator Operator for Skanska, has had overwhelmingly positive feedback after operating the EC230 Electric, particularly in terms of the ease of charging and the performance of the machine when testing it across different applications. He says: “If I had the choice of an electric or diesel machine in this size class I would choose electric as there are so many advantages over a diesel machine. When the machine was delivered to site there were many sceptics who thought the machine didn’t have the capacity to last the whole day, but they have all been proved wrong!”\\r\\nOperator Richard Sjöblom says he would now choose to drive electric over diesel\\r\\nIn addition to the EC230 Electric, it is required that all other machines be run on HVO (hydrogenated vegetable oil) – a biofuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90%.', 'German firm Böhm Entsorgung is putting its Volvo L25 Electric wheel loader from Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) to good use – helping process materials for recycling in its enclosed trans-shipment hall\\r\\nIts zero emissions make it ideal for use in enclosed spaces\\r\\nCompact but powerful, the L25 Electric makes light work of heavy materials like paper and plastic materials\\r\\nGerman firm Böhm Entsorgung is making quite a name for itself in its hometown of Möttingen as a trailblazer in the recycling of paper, wood and plastic. In its enclosed trans-shipment hall, a Volvo L25 Electric wheel loader from Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has just finished sorting a delivery of raw materials for further processing – all completed without emitting any exhaust fumes.\\r\\nWastepaper is an important raw material. “In Europe, 75% of paper is currently recycled,” explains Manuel Reinsch, Managing Director of Böhm-Entsorgungs GmbH. “In order to achieve such a high recycling rate, the raw material must first be sorted to ensure that it is as pure as possible, dry, and free from contaminants, such as glue or staples.”\\r\\nZero-emission, the Volvo L25 Electric is ideal for use in enclosed spaces\\r\\nFor this reason, Böhm Entsorgung has built a large trans-shipment hall on its 60,000 square metre site, where the containers with wastepaper that has been collected from printing plants, industrial companies and recycling centres can be unloaded and kept dry, whatever the weather.\\r\\nBetween stacks of paper bales, the electric wheel loader uses its shovel to pull apart the mountain of paper that has just been delivered and unloaded from a truck and pushes the material in manageable quantities onto a conveyor belt which then feeds the paper to the press. The fact that the new Volvo L25 Electric wheel loader moves almost silently around the hall goes mostly unnoticed over the noise from the conveyor belts and large presses. However low noise operation was not the deciding factor for the purchase of an electric wheel loader from Volvo CE. “For us, it was crucial that the wheel loader did not emit any exhaust gases because it is predominantly used in enclosed spaces,” explains Manuel Reinsch.\\r\\nThe Volvo L25 Electric packs a battery capacity of 39kWh so it can work continuously for six hours before it requires charging\\r\\nMAKING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION A CORPORATE GOAL\\r\\nFor this family-run recycling company, an environmentally friendly operation is of great importance. At its state-of-the-art facilities, its 90 employees feed waste and raw materials of all kinds into the recycling process.\\r\\nSolar panels cover the hall roofs, supplying electricity to power the operation of the presses, shredders and conveyor belts – and now also for charging the firm’s Volvo L25 Electric. “Wheel loaders with an electric drive are an important step for us towards a climate-neutral future,” says Manuel Reinsch. A second electric wheel loader, the slightly smaller, more compact Volvo L20 Electric is already on order from Volvo CE.\\r\\nWith a battery capacity of 39kWh, the Volvo L25 Electric can work continuously for six hours before it requires charging. This is more than sufficient for one working day, as driver Christian Gorowoy determined within just the first few months of use.\\r\\nChristian is enthusiastic about the performance of the Volvo L25 Electric. “Paper and plastic films are very heavy materials, but the Volvo L25 Electric can handle them effortlessly,” says Gorowoy. He also appreciates the manoeuvrability and good all-round visibility afforded by the machine. And he is pleased that his employer is investing in climate-friendly technologies. “We all need to do something, for the future of our children.”\\r\\nA LONG-STANDING VOLVO CE CUSTOMER\\r\\nBöhm Entsorgung has used Volvo CE machines for many years. In its machine park, there are two Volvo L150H wheel loaders as well as two material handlers, an EW240E and an EW160E with elevated cab, both of which are ideal for waste and recycling applications and are used here for sorting old materials and loading the containers.\\r\\n“The quality, performance and efficiency of Volvo machines speak for themselves,” says Manuel Reinsch. “But the first-class service and excellent support we receive from Alexander Lemke and the entire team at German Dealer Robert Aebi GmbH is just as important.”', 'Every market outside Europe and China is demonstrating high activity and strong growth for Q3, 2022 thanks to continued development in the commodity and infrastructure segments, resulting in a 23% increase in net sales compared to 2021, a greater increase than the last quarter. This is despite an overall decline in net order intake (32%) and deliveries (7%) – again a smaller decrease than the last quarter indicating a stable growth trend for Volvo CE.\\r\\nWith net sales increasing by 23% to SEK 24,238 M, up from SEK 19,638 M in the same quarter last year, profitability remains strong. When adjusted for currency movements net sales increased by 9%, of which net sales of machines were up by 10% and service sales by 3% - reflecting Volvo CE’s continued focus on service solutions for customers. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 3,773 M (SEK 2,635 M in 2021) with a positive impact from price realization and mix effects, which were partially offset by increased material and freight costs.\\r\\nPROGRESS FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW\\r\\nWhile profitability has been the focus for this third quarter, sustainability has still remained high on the agenda with the continued global rollout of Volvo CE’s electric machines – including the ECR25 Electric excavator in South Korea. In China, a series of customer events were held across the country to introduce customers to the company’s electric offering and charging solutions. Elsewhere, Volvo CE launched a trial test pilot for a product configurator, an online tool that allows customers to ‘build and price’ their electric compact excavators and wheel loaders.\\r\\nMelker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “In this quarter we took still more steps on our transformation journey, ensuring that our electric machines and charging solutions are built to fit the needs of our customers in any application and region of the world. Together with our customers, we can lead the transition to a decarbonized construction industry, while still continuing our efforts to build upon our strong financial position.”\\r\\nMARKET DEVELOPMENT\\r\\nProfitability has been ensured thanks to a robust North American and South American market and good progress in most Asian countries, except China, supported by government stimulus programs and high commodity prices.\\r\\nAfter years of growth in China, the largest construction equipment market in the world, the Chinese market continued to be challenging with pricing pressure and weak demand due to lower economic activity combined with restrictions and lockdowns related to Covid-19.\\r\\nIn Europe, construction activity still remained high while a mild slowdown continued with increased uncertainty about the economic development making customers somewhat cautious. While overall global deliveries were down this quarter, deliveries were actually higher in Europe than the previous year, when excluding Russia. The lower global order intake is also an effect of halted sales in Russia and a high order intake in Q3, 2021.\\r\\nTable 1.

Thanks to the use of this patent-pending solution, the now 100% electric rallycross cars are recovered from the racetracks without any manual intervention – meaning no personnel have to walk on to the tracks and physically strap or hook the car to a recovery vehicle as would previously occur – making it not only safer to intervene, but also more efficient and speedier. \\r\\nThe solution has been created in collaboration with Granfors Racing and Engcon\\r\\nVolvo CE co-designed the solution in its role as Official Construction Equipment Supplier and Track Building Partner for the World RX race series, together with Swedish start-up Granfors Racing. After being trialed at the race weekend in Riga, Latvia, in September, it has now been adopted by the FIA as the most efficient recovery solution for the race series. Eagle eyed viewers will be able to see it in action during the upcoming race weekend (October 8-9) in Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium.\\r\\nArvid Rinaldo, Brand Communication and Partnerships for Volvo CE, says: “With the speedy introduction of this innovative solution, we are living up to our commitment to push both our industry and motorsport forward when it comes to safety and sustainability. Thanks to this strong partnership with the FIA and Engcon, we are able to accelerate a shift towards electrification that is reliable, efficient and most vitally safe.”\\r\\nIn safe hands\\r\\nWith the advent of electric rallycross racing come entirely new safety considerations given that the rallycross cars can accelerate from 0-100km/h in less than two seconds – quicker than a Formula 1 car – combined with the inevitable care that needs to be factored in when handling electrically charged vehicles.\\r\\nBenoît Dupont, Off-Road Category Manager for the FIA, says: “Electric racing is a new technology which brings new challenges around safety – we need to adapt to that and create new tools. Volvo CE has been really proactive in helping us, creating a tool that allows us to remove the car in a safe and efficient way. And this is really what we were looking for – to add electric safety on top of efficiency.”\\r\\nBecause safety is not something to be taken lightly, the FIA has introduced a smart traffic-light system as part of its new electromobility safety protocols. Whenever an electric rallycross car comes off the racetrack, a green light on top of the car indicates the safety status of the car. If it turns red, it indicates to those nearby that it is not safe to touch the car and to await official recovery of the vehicle.\\r\\nThe power of three \\r\\nTo keep in line with this system and to allow the safe recovery of electric rallycross cars that have ‘turned red’, Volvo CE and Granfors Racing came up with their own three-fold safety system. Once drivers have been safely recovered from the car by trained officials, the car is then carefully picked up by a flat insulated rescue plate, which is controlled, lifted, lowered and angled as necessary with a 360° Engcon tilt rotator attached to a Volvo EWR150E wheeled excavator. The combination of these three tools together not only ensures the safe handling of battery-powered vehicles but also provides unrivalled efficiency and flexibility. The EWR150 wheeled excavator, run on biofuels, offers a tight, compact swing essential for the complex maneuvers required during this process and the reliable handling needed to quickly and safely deliver the crashed racecar to the designated recovery area.\\r\\nDeveloped in collaboration with Engcon, which provided the tilt rotator attachment, and tested under thorough safety requirements set by the FIA, the result is a collaborative innovation set to break new boundaries in motorsport safety.\\r\\nMorten Fjeld-Nielsen, Sales Manager for Engcon Norway, says: “It’s fantastic to see Volvo CE finding innovative ways to use our tilt rotators in racing – proving how flexible and adaptable our solutions are to any application. Without this type of tool, the ability to rescue cars in the fast and efficient way that we do now maybe wouldn’t even be possible.”\\r\\nThe solution is also making a huge difference to driver safety. Klara Andersson, one of the drivers for the Construction Equipment Dealer Team, says: “While we always strive to win and every race is an adrenalin ride from start to finish, we know that our safety is always front of mind at World RX, particularly as we navigate this new era for electric racing. With this new robust set-up, we can be confident that our safety is in good hands – and that any interruptions to the race are kept to the absolute minimum.”\\r\\nYou can watch all the action of the race in Belgium on World RX’s live streaming channel RX+.', 'Volvo CE and BRIO will launch a new range of wooden construction toys to delight and excite the imagination of aspiring young construction engineers\\r\\nThis is the first time the toymaker has collaborated with a major construction manufacturer\\r\\nThe new Volvo CE-themed mini machines will be available from Autumn 2022\\r\\nBRIO Builder’s newest range is a construction system featuring a wheel loader, hauler, and excavator, designed in close collaboration with Volvo CE to ensure they closely resemble their real-life counterparts, and all proudly sporting the iconic yellow livery of Volvo CE. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis exciting new partnership is set to inspire the very youngest generation of budding engineers, children aged three and up, who are so often fascinated by huge construction vehicles and aligns with our purpose to build the world we want to live in.\\r\\n\\r\\nArvid Rinaldo, Brand Partnership at Volvo CE, says: “We’re thrilled to see this partnership with BRIO come to life.

It has enjoyed a solid performance for the last quarter, despite lower deliveries, down by 27%, due primarily to the market decline in China. Net order intake has also declined by 42% in the last quarter as a consequence of this drop in China and a natural outcome from the high order intake experienced during the same quarter 2021.\\r\\nHowever, the downturn in China has been well compensated by growth in the rest of the world. In Q2, 2022, total net sales were flat at SEK 25,814 M (SEK 25,839 M in Q2, 2021) – remaining steady due to market variations which saw sales greatly increase in North America (28%) and South America (121%) but drop slightly in the larger markets of Europe (-2%) and Asia (-24%). While service sales continued to rise, enjoying an increase of 5%, net sales of machines declined by 11%.\\r\\nVolvo CE is continuing to weather the challenges created by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine by supporting its communities, preparing for the future and providing more sustainable solutions in the here-and-now with its strong focus on electromobility and services. This last quarter has demonstrated its commitment to building a better world with the world’s first customer handover of a machine made using fossil-free steel and investment in Dutch firm Limach to expand its already industry-leading electromobility portfolio.\\r\\nMelker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “Thanks to the hard work of our colleagues and supply chain partners, we are enjoying a confident performance with solid sales on a par with last year. With our dedication to expanding our electromobility offering and taking action to place more sustainable construction solutions into the hands of our customers, we not only remain strong in the face of an unpredictable global outlook but are geared for growth.”\\r\\nMARKET DEVELOPMENT\\r\\nConstruction activity in most markets has remained on good levels, driven by both the commercial sector and the ongoing investments in infrastructure. While the Chinese market declined due to lower economic activity and pricing pressures, Asia outside of China instead saw strong growth in key markets supported by government stimulus and high commodity prices. There is a continued need to renew and expand an aging infrastructure in many countries across the world, with the South American market remaining on a favorable trend with demand for commodities on a high level. While construction activity in both Europe and North America remained high in Q2, total market deliveries were impacted by limited machine availability because of supply chain constraints.\\r\\nThe quarter also marked an important event for Volvo CE with the return of its flagship Volvo Days in Eskilstuna, Sweden, for the first time in four years. Under the banner of ‘Change Starts Here’, over 7,000 customers visited the company’s headquarters to take a closer look at its industry-leading line-up of products and services for today and tomorrow.\\r\\nTable 1.

While we align for an exciting project, players can look forward to the Volvo CE-powered reinforcement of gameplay aspects in Farming Simulator 22 in the near future.”\\r\\nFROM REAL WORLD TO VIRTUAL WORLD\\r\\nGiven this is the first time construction machines like the Volvo L200H High Lift have been gamified, developers had to take extra effort to digitalize them. A team of developers visited a real-world construction site to study the machines in action and then transfer the machines’ real-life movements into the virtual sphere. In doing so that they were able to map out a digital version as close as possible to the original.\\r\\nThe most exciting aspect of gaming is that players can do things they generally do not get to do otherwise. So for Volvo CE, it is a chance to introduce operator skills to an audience who may not have been able to access them before.\\r\\nWith this latest version of Farming Simulator, players can add additional levels of complexity – so whether they are a younger player who wants to simply drive a Volvo L200H High Lift wheel loader or a more strategic player looking to create their own unique farming production chain from logging through to market, there is something for everyone.

Now, an important milestone has been reached with the testing of a world-first emission free hydrogen fuel cell articulated hauler prototype, the Volvo HX04. \\r\\nCarolina Diez Ferrer, Head of Advanced Engineering Programs at Volvo CE, says: “Being inventors of the world’s first articulated hauler more than 55 years ago, we are happy and proud to again drive change with this fuel cell hauler concept. While an early prototype, this innovation will give valuable insights into the opportunities of hydrogen in the energy transformation alongside battery-electric solutions. We believe that by exploring multiple technologies and working in partnership we can create the best path forward to decarbonize the construction industry.”\\r\\nDriving change through partnerships\\r\\nThe Volvo HX04 is the result of a research project running between 2018 and 2022, with funding from FFI, a national collaboration between the Swedish Innovation Agency VINNOVA, Swedish Energy Agency, and Swedish Transport Administration, to support sustainable vehicle strategic research, innovation and development. Partners include Volvo CE, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, who provided specialist competence on driveline development and safety, and PowerCell Sweden, a developer of fuel cell-based hydrogen-electric power solutions.\\r\\nThe development and building of the six-wheel prototype has largely been carried out at Volvo CE’s facility in Braås, Sweden – the same location where Gravel Charlie, the world’s first articulated hauler, was born back in 1966, giving the Volvo HX04 the nickname “Electric Charlie”. Engineers at the Technology Center in Eskilstuna, Sweden, have contributed with software development and knowledge gathered through its fuel cell test lab. While not commercially available, valuable insights from the concept will inevitably inform future production.\\r\\nHydrogen refueling station\\r\\nInfrastructure for hydrogen is still in development, which means refueling the Volvo HX04 is an important aspect to solve in the project. Shell installed a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling station at the Volvo CE test track in Braås. Both Shell and Volvo Group are founding members of H2Accelerate, a collaboration of companies working to foster conditions for the mass market roll-out of hydrogen trucks in Europe.\\r\\nOliver Bishop, Shell’s General Manager for Hydrogen Mobility, says: “Providing the fueling infrastructure for this innovative project gave Shell the opportunity to demonstrate our technical capabilities in hydrogen, and enabled us to support one of our key global collaboration partners in taking another step forward in their decarbonization journey, which goes to the heart and intent of Shell’s Powering Progress strategy.”\\r\\nHow it works\\r\\nThe fueling process for hydrogen vehicles is fast – the Volvo HX04 is charged with 12 kg hydrogen in circa 7,5 minutes, enabling it to operate for approximately four hours. Fuel cells work by combining hydrogen with oxygen and the resulting chemical reaction produces electricity which powers the machine. In the process, fuel cells also produce heat that can be used for heating of the cab. Fuel cells only emit one thing – water vapor.\\r\\nIn principle, a fuel cell works much like a battery except that it generates its own electricity from the hydrogen onboard as needed rather than being charged from an external source. Vehicles with fuel cell electric powertrains have an uptime, range, and fueling time similar to that of combustion engine powered vehicles.\\r\\nWhile battery-electric vehicles and biofuels are commercially available today – as more sustainable alternatives to diesel – commercialization of hydrogen-powered machines is expected during the second half of this decade.', 'The A30G articulated hauler built using fossil-free steel was handed over by President of Volvo CE Melker Jernberg to long-standing customer NCC today, 1 June 2022, at a ceremony hosted by LeadIt – the Leadership Group for Industry Transition – in conjunction with the United Nations environmental meeting Stockholm +50. It was attended by John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy to Climate and Annika Strandhäll, Swedish Minister for Climate.\\r\\nThe move comes just nine months after the company unveiled the world’s first vehicle concept using fossil-free steel, as part of the testing of the implementation in an ordinary production setup. While commercial introduction is expected to be gradual with selected customers, this speedy first handover is an important milestone in the Group’s ambition to drive industry transformation towards global climate goals.

So, when asked to support the build of the tracks for the new 680bhp electric cars, the company decided to use its off-road expertise to help World RX in designing and testing a whole new series of track elements that will encourage the racing to be as close as it is thrilling.\\r\\nWORLD RX TRACKS 2.0\\r\\nFollowing a series of workshops on what features make the ‘perfect’ rallycross track, Volvo CE invited the FIA, Race Series organizer Rallycross Promoter GmbH and professional drivers Timmy Hanssen, Klara Andersson and Niclas Grönholm to its specially developed ‘RallyCross Test Lab’ at the GTR racetrack in Eskilstuna, Sweden. Here, Volvo CE has helped test and design jumps, turns and dynamic features to keep the racing electrifyingly close. These included steeply banked turns, chicanes and epic jumps. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a three-day test at the Rallycross Test Lab in early May, each track element was closely evaluated, with lots of ideas on how to encourage more overtaking and a greater spectacle for racegoers. The racing experts’ suggested improvements – which were then quickly realized using Volvo CE’s machines, refining each element until it was considered perfect. Once each feature was signed off by the FIA, the build data was captured in 3D on Volvo CE’s Dig Assist in-cab machine control application. These data can then be programmed into Volvo machines and recreated at each of the tracks the race series visits during the coming World Championship. This will not only reduce the build time of each track considerably, but also do it with minimal carbon footprint.\\r\\nDESIGNED FOR RACERS – BY RACERS\\r\\nKlara Andersson, driver for the new Construction Equipment Dealer Team, is looking forward to trying out the new tracks\\r\\n“The new tracks are going to be awesome!” says Klara Andersson, who drives for the new Construction Equipment Dealer Team in the forthcoming championship. “The jumps are epic – the fastest ones we will hit at 100 km/h and fly through the air for 25 meters and more!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The new race elements will be thrilling to drive,” agrees Klara’s teammate Niclas Grönholm. “The steep banking means we will be able to drive through turns on full throttle, while other corners are cleverly designed so that there are multiple racing lines – leading to wheel-to-wheel racing and more overtaking.”\\r\\nNO COMPROMISE CONSTRUCTION\\r\\nA series of workshops were held to determine the most exciting and efficient track builds.\\r\\n“Our aim is to create the next generation of thrilling Rallycross circuits in the most effective and sustainable way,” says Arvid Rinaldo, who heads up the partnership and the operational involvement in World RX for Volvo CE. “Our ultimate aim is to support the build and upgrade of tracks with a zero-carbon footprint, but thanks to the use of our electric equipment and latest low-emission engines running on biofuels, even at the outset we hope to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of each track build. It’s the perfect platform for us to demonstrate to our own audiences how we can help transform the construction equipment industry and motorsport to be more sustainable.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2022 FIA World Rallycross Championship season starts at the Höljes circuit in Sweden on July 2-3, with the first race weekend at the legendary Nürburgring in Germany on July 30-31.', 'The majority investment in Electric Special Technics B.V - which operates under the brand name Limach - complements Volvo CE’s long-term electrification roadmap and provides the opportunity to swiftly broaden the electromobility portfolio and add to the five electric compact machines currently available, further extending what is already the widest range on the market.\\r\\nLimach offers customized electric wheeled and crawler excavators to the Dutch market. An innovative company, it applies proven Li-Ion battery technology to develop first-class electrical construction machines using conventional Volvo CE products as a base.\\r\\n“Climate change is real and we believe collaborating in new ways is key to meet the growing demand for sustainable solutions. As a leader in electric construction solutions, we see Limach as an interesting actor in a progressive market, and a great complement to our existing portfolio of electric machines, meaning our customers will benefit from a broader range to suit their requirements.\\r\\n“Working together, and with our combined customer base, opens opportunities for co-learning and expanding experiences of these types of solutions, as we continue driving the transformation towards sustainable power sources,” says Thomas Bitter, Head of Technology at Volvo CE.\\r\\nThe current range extends from the compact E18.3 electric mini excavator with an operating range of 1,810kg to the E140.1, which packs an operating weight of over 14,000 kg and complements Volvo CE’s existing range of electric machines. Together, they offer customers a variety of solutions to meet their emission reduction ambitions, says Henri de Groot, CTO at Limach\\r\\nThe internal combustion engine on select excavators will be replaced by a Limach developed electrification kit.\\r\\nRens de Bruijn, CEO at Limach, says: “Limach was established with the purpose to develop construction equipment with an electric drive. Each machine is custom-made at our production facility in Ede in the Netherlands and delivered according to customer specifications. Since the development of our first demonstrator excavator in 2017, we have seen growing demand from customers in the Netherlands. Thanks to the investment from Volvo CE, we can scale-up production of our electric excavators and extend the range we offer to meet this growing appetite for electric drives.”\\r\\nLimach will continue to operate as a standalone company. The transaction is not expected to have a significant impact on the Volvo Group’s earnings or financial position.', 'The ongoing pandemic in China has had a significant impact on sales in the construction equipment industry’s largest market in the world, leading to a drop of 9% in overall global sales for the first quarter of 2022. However, all other regions have played a strong role in softening the impact by demonstrating a steady increase in sales for the first three months of the year, with South America reporting the highest increase of 62%, North America rising 11%, Africa and Oceania 5% and Europe 2%. Further illustrating the escalating importance of service solutions, service sales have also increased by 17%.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “There can be no doubt that the industry and the wider world itself is in the midst of extremely challenging times, but I am proud that we as an organization are tackling these issues head on – supplying our customers with the products and services they need today, while focusing on the tragic humanitarian crises going on around the globe and taking action on urgent climate change. During this difficult period, we are keeping up the speed of transformation to more sustainable construction and infrastructure solutions, helping to decarbonize value chains, all the while safeguarding our communities around the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Q1 2022, Volvo CE saw net sales decrease to SEK 22,613 M from SEK 24,742 M in Q1, 2021. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 2,810 M (SEK 3,822 M in Q1, 2021), corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 12.4%, down from 15.4%. The operating income has been negatively affected by lower machine volumes and higher material costs, which were partially mitigated by improved price realization and higher service volumes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe elevated levels of order intake from the same period last year as the world recovered somewhat from the impact of the pandemic, has meant there has been a drop in order intake for Q1, 2022 – declining by 42%. While mainly due to the continued decline in China, order intake has also felt the effect of a cancellation of orders in Russia and restrictive order slotting due to large order books. Effects from a strained supply chain have also led to deliveries decreasing by 33%.\\r\\nMARKET DEVELOPMENT\\r\\nThe European market grew by 13% in the first two months of the year, influenced by a large number of investments in infrastructure and housing, while North America increased by 20% thanks to the high levels of housing construction and manufacturing in the region. Due to the strong demand for commodities, South America has continued its robust rise in market demand with a 45% increase on the same quarter last year. However, all of this has been affected by a 33% decline in the Chinese market, primarily due to a spike in Covid-19 cases that has led to restrictions and lockdowns across the country, but also due to a price pressure that remains primarily on excavators. Asia outside of China has also been negatively impacted by price increases on machines in India, related to new emission regulations, and has reported an 8% fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolvo CE is demonstrating a solid performance during challenging times, while also continuing its evolution as a sustainable leader, not just for the company but for the industry and society as a whole. This quarter marks the successful launch of its first fully electric machine in the Asian market – the ECR25 Electric compact excavator – now available for customers to buy in South Korea and the introduction of a tailored CO2 Reduction Program aimed at helping customers realize their own unique goals towards carbon neutrality.\\r\\n\\r\\nTable 1. Volvo Construction Equipment, net sales by market area, in Millions of Swedish Krona', 'Like Siri, caring for the environment comes natural for the younger generation. Their call for action to the older generation, that today holds the power to decide how to combat climate change, is real and at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) we listen and acknowledge the vital role we have to play to drive the change needed. What’s more, we owe it to Siri and to future generations. We are probably the last generation that can make a real difference and build the world we want to live in, rather than the world we are left with.\\r\\nCarl Slotte, Head of Sales Region Europe, comments on the need for change. “First of all, I am extremely proud to work for a company, like Volvo CE, that has ambitious and concrete sustainability goals. As one of the leading companies in our industry we have a responsibility, and we take it. Our climate targets are clear: from 2040 we shall have 100% fossil fuel free vehicles across the Volvo Group and reach net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions.”\\r\\nAs an enabler and platform to drive the message of change, Volvo CE is today launching the new marketing campaign, ‘Change Starts Here’. This new marketing approach has two main purposes. The first is to take the lead in driving change within the very important areas of sustainability, electromobility and services and to encourage all our stakeholders to join to take action. And the other is to demonstrate to customers how we are transforming our industry through our offering within these three key areas – and to do so while giving them an equally good experience of these messages no matter if they engage through a virtual or physical platform. That is what the omnichannel approach is about.\\r\\nLast year, Volvo CE announced its intentions to adopt a new omnichannel marketing approach that will allow us to connect with our customers, dealers and other stakeholders via a mix of virtual and physical events. Whilst the challenges we face require us to work more closely and collaboratively, it is just not practical or sustainable for this to be all in-person. So, we are soon launching an exciting new virtual platform and offering our stakeholders choice in how they interact with us. Volvo Days, our flagship customer relationship building event in Eskilstuna, Sweden in June, will, for example, have a new look and feel, with both physical and virtual options to join us and experience what we have to offer. Digital and physical experiences connected in a way not done before – coupled with the red thread of sustainability, electromobility and services.\\r\\nCarl Slotte\\r\\nSustainability is the overarching umbrella for our strategic agenda where clearly defined science-based targets make the foundation for our future development. Electrification is one key to drive a fossil-free industry going forward and Volvo CE is today offering the widest range of electric compact machines on the market and has a clear pathway to grow and extend our electric offering, from compact machines to heavy equipment. Another proof point of our commitment to drive electrification in partnership is the cooperation with the FIA World Rallycross Championship, which gives us a global platform to demonstrate the potential of electric power across industries.\\r\\nWith our services, we have an opportunity to help customers maximize the productivity and efficiencies of their worksites. Our recently launched CO₂ Reduction Program, for example, is just one way we are looking to help customers tackle their carbon footprints and we are continuing to evolve the services and solutions we offer.\\r\\nWe have a real opportunity to make a difference together, and to build the world we want to live in; for us, for Siri and the future generations, customers, suppliers, policymakers. Let´s do this together! Change Starts Here.', '• Volvo Construction Equipment signs three-year agreement to become official supplier to inaugural fully electric FIA World Rallycross Championship\\r\\n• The championship will be held in iconic locations from July to the end of 2022, expanding to additional markets in subsequent seasons\\r\\n• Establishes a multi-stakeholder engagement platform to accelerate sustainable transformation in the construction equipment industry and motorsport\\r\\nA PARTNERSHIP TO ACCELERATE TRANSFORMATION\\r\\nThe three-year partnership will see Volvo CE put to work a mix of its industry-leading electric construction equipment and its most sustainable and innovative solutions in the exciting world of motorsport as the FIA World Rallycross Championship now enters a completely new era of fully electric racing.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution and every customer’s business is different, which is why these tailored solutions offer a practical way to make significant improvements to how machines are used on site today and in the future.\\r\\nNiklas Nillroth, Head of Sustainability and Public Affairs at Volvo CE, says: “Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time, and one of the most important actions we can take is to help reduce our customers’ emissions. It is vital to get everyone involved and make it easy to contribute as part of one’s daily work. Every step on the path to net zero counts.”\\r\\n“The services we use have been built on decades of innovation here at Volvo CE, but now for the first time we are bringing them together in one cohesive program that can be individually tailored to best fit our customers’ needs.”\\r\\nCO2 REDUCTION IN FOUR STEPS\\r\\nThe CO2 Reduction Program is designed to be easily integrated into customer’s plans, while maintaining required levels of profitability and productivity, and is based on four simple steps:\\r\\nInsights – Volvo CE starts by understanding where the customer currently is in terms of carbon emissions and establishing a baseline to compare against. Using telematics data from connected machines, Volvo CE determines the CO2 footprint for all machines on site – no matter the brand. Mapping this data then allows the customer to visualize the impact of carbon reduction changes over time.\\r\\nAnalyze – The experts at Volvo CE analyze the customer’s machine data and conduct a site study to understand how the material flow, fleet composition, and operator behavior affects the emissions on their site(s). Volvo CE then illustrates where improvements can be made and what actions need to be taken to reduce CO2 /ton. Using Volvo Site Simulation, the experts reveal to the customer the impact of these improvements to help motivate real change.\\r\\nImprove – After identifying the specific actions required, Volvo CE helps the customer to implement them. This will vary from customer to customer, but Volvo CE is there to support with key services such as Eco Operator training and other efficiency services such as Efficient Load Out – or plan a smooth transition towards electric machines.\\r\\nSustain – At this stage the customer will already start seeing the rewards of their efforts, both economically and environmentally. However, the final step is for Volvo CE to support in sustaining these efforts, by continuously monitoring the CO2 level over time, to make sure that the improvements reduce emissions and customers do not slip back into old habits. Volvo CE will also look for new ways to reduce emissions even further in the future.\\r\\nLEADING THE WAY. TOGETHER.\\r\\nThis customer program is one of many initiatives devised by Volvo CE towards the needed transformation within the construction industry. The company has set an industry-leading target to reach net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 – with a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions across its own operations and a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions across product use as early as 2030.\\r\\nIn 2013, Volvo CE introduced the world’s first carbon neutral construction equipment production facility in Braås, Sweden – which recently built the world’s first vehicle made of fossil-free steel - and in addition currently offers the largest range of electric machines.\\r\\nVolvo CE encourages customers to find out how they can elevate their efforts to reach net zero or take the first step on their sustainability journey today by contacting their local dealer or visiting the Volvo CO2 Reduction Program.', 'The 2.5-ton battery electric compact excavator is the first electric machine by a major manufacturer to arrive in the Asian market – launching first in Korea with further roll out planned for China, Japan and Singapore. The demand for electric equipment has been growing across the region, prompted by stronger emission regulations, government incentives and an urgent desire to build more sustainably. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Volvo ECR25 Electric excavator has already proved a success in Europe and North America since it was unveiled in 2019, thanks to its ability to match power and performance with zero emissions, near silence and a much more comfortable work environment for operators. Korea was chosen as the first market for Asia due to its adoption of new technologies and innovative ways of working – as well as its quick response to building an electric charging infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nJaetack Lim, Head of Market Korea at Volvo CE Region Asia, says: “Increasingly, authorities are recognizing the need to work more sustainably and embrace new technologies that will allow us to tackle our global climate change crisis with equipment that provides less noise, fewer vibrations and no exhaust fumes. We are proud to be leading the charge by being the first major manufacturer to offer electric solutions to a region that is so significant to the global construction equipment market.”\\r\\nBUILDING TOMORROW\\r\\nThe introduction to the Asia market represents the next step in Volvo CE’s ambition to move its range of compact excavators and wheel loaders to electric, stopping entirely new diesel engine-based development of these models. As such, the market can expect more electric compact equipment to be introduced in the future. The launch also represents the company’s continued investment into building the world we want to live in – with electric solutions forming a major part of that ambition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ECR25 Electric excavator comes with an integrated on-board charger allowing customers to charge from 0 to 80% in under six hours. With an optional fast off-board charger (380V-420V three phase), it takes just one hour to charge from 0 to 80%. For the most accurate picture, Volvo dealers can calculate the expected operating time and optimum charging solution based on customers’ activities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the ideal solution for customers in Asia looking to meet emission regulations while maintaining the same levels of productivity they have come to expect from its diesel counterpart. Numerous applications range from agriculture and landscaping through to utilities and building – with the added benefit that operators can run the machine in noise sensitive areas and out of standard hours, as well as in low-carbon projects and indoors, without the need for costly fume extraction systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nA reservation tool for customers to order one of these machines is now open here, with delivery expected in Q3, 2022.', 'Leading brand expert Doris Gong has joined the company, effective from today, to oversee the operational and strategic direction of all communication for the regions, across both traditional and digital channels. She will serve as spokesperson to all media in Asia and China. Given the global importance of these markets, she is well poised to maximize the business potential for the brand, while integrating the company’s purpose to build the world we want to live in through innovations, Volvo CE’s use of resources and its care for people in mind.\\r\\nBased in Shanghai, China, she will be part of the Brand, Marketing and Communication management team representing Region Asia, China and India.

Doris’ new appointment will be vital in Volvo CE’s ability to manage these increasingly complex industry shifts and deliver the continued impact our customers and society need from us.', 'Committed to innovation and development, Volvo CE continues to evolve its range of articulated haulers, making them even smarter, more efficient and easier to operate. Uptime is maximized too, whilst maintenance costs are kept to a minimum, reducing total cost of ownership.\\r\\nEFFICIENT OPERATION WITH HAUL ASSIST\\r\\nThe Haul Assist suite of tools is a game-changing solution designed to get the most out of the Volvo Articulated Hauler. Powered by a 10” Volvo Co-Pilot monitor – which is available on a variety of machines from haulers and excavators to pavers – it provides valuable insight to help customers optimize the efficiency of their haul cycles and boost profitability.\\r\\nA new addition to Haul Assist, the Tire Pressure Monitoring System enables monitoring of tire pressure and temperature from the comfort of the cab. Inflation pressure having a marked impact on tire wear, proactive monitoring is invaluable to optimize tire life as well as fuel efficiency, machine performance and operator comfort.\\r\\nMap provides a real-time overview of the on-site traffic to help navigate around more effectively. The whereabouts of every machine and vehicle – irrespective of the type or brand – as well as visitors on site are now visible, so long as they are connected to the map application. Alongside haul roads, Map also shows load and dump zones, and flags single-lane sections, restricted zones and speed-restricted areas, helping to anticipate operating decisions and reduce unnecessary stops.\\r\\nAlso part of Haul Assist is On-Board Weighing, a proven tool that allows payload information to be viewed in real-time, helping to eliminate carry-back and overloading. As well as boosting productivity, this also reduces excessive fuel consumption and machine wear and tear.\\r\\nSMARTER PERFORMANCE\\r\\nOperator comfort has always been at the heart of design – from the centrally-positioned operator seat offering excellent visibility, through to user-friendly controls. And a range of automated functions is now offering even more support to enhance ease of operation and performance.\\r\\nTerrain Memory is a handy feature of the intelligent Volvo drivetrain that identifies and remembers slippery road segments to ensure optimized traction control and off-road mobility. OptiShift enables fast and smooth directional changes, whilst Downhill Speed Control automatically maintains a constant speed when operating on downward gradients; both these, and the Cruise control function, are fitted as standard since 2019 and are available for retrofit on older haulers.\\r\\nMAXIMIZING UPTIME, MINIMIZING MAINTENANCE COSTS\\r\\nNot only easy to operate and highly efficient, Volvo Articulated Haulers are also designed to be easy to service. Daily or even weekly greasing is a thing of the past, required instead every 250 hours on a Volvo Articulated Hauler, the longest time interval in the industry. Add to this long engine service intervals – up to 1,000 hours on Stage V and Tier 4 Final models – and less than half the fluid volume of most of its counterparts when measured over the lifetime of the machine. The result is reduced maintenance requirements and consumables, helping to keep the machine at work while lowering maintenance costs and environmental impact.\\r\\nThe improvements introduced to Volvo Articulated Haulers are delivering both performance and cost advantages for customers. New work-enhancing tools and straightforward servicing are just some examples contributing towards more profitable – and sustainable – operations. All part of Volvo CE’s commitment to drive transformation in the industry and achieve its goal to have net zero value chain emissions by 2040.\\r\\nNot all products are available in all markets.', 'Brand agnostic, this new digital service will be available to a wide range of customers who are looking to make use of tools such as Efficient Load Out and Connected Load Out to improve work flow, boost profitability and reduce environmental impact. It also forms an important part of Volvo CE’s target to double revenue from services to 30% by 2030.\\r\\nGlobal Load Out Solutions will be a separate business entity led by Managing Director, Annika Nissen, who joins Volvo CE to take up the role. The aim is to make it easier for customers to access and take full advantage of connectivity tools which maximize the fill rate of constructions trucks and therefore cut down on the amount of work cycles – loading tools which form just one part of Volvo CE’s connected solutions.\\r\\nAnnika, with the support of a small team, will be responsible for commercializing the existing load out solutions and growing the market for these with both existing and new Volvo customers. The new company will take ownership for both solutions and be responsible for the development plan, sales strategy and support. \\r\\n“I’ve spent much of my career in the automotive sector – including roles at Volvo Group, as well as small start-ups, so I’m excited to be back at Volvo but with the opportunity to work on a brand-new company, growing it from the ground up, recruiting a small team, with sales and development competences and building up customer relationships”, says Annika Nissen, Managing Director at Global Load Out Solutions.\\r\\n“The market for digital services is growing and we anticipate strong demand for this new solution from organizations looking to explore how new technologies can transform the way in which they work.”\\r\\nGunnar Thorud, Head of Productivity and chairman of the Board for the new company, says: “At Volvo CE, we are always adapting to challenges and trends that drive our industry, such as digitalization and changing customer needs. We are proud to be launching this new company to build on our already impressive load out solutions and accelerate our ambition to support our customers to work more efficiently and sustainably now and in the future.”\\r\\nThe new business entity will operate like a start-up company, with a small, entrepreneurial and autonomous team that can react swiftly to market, and customer demands as well as new ways of working. ', 'Despite the continued decline in China, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) sustains its solid growth with high infrastructure investment particularly across Europe, North America and South America, and increased revenue from services. The current drop in China is due to a saturated market for excavators following last year’s high sales levels and the overall slowdown in construction and infrastructure investments across the region.\\r\\nIn Q4, 2021, net sales increased by 5% to SEK 21,812 M (20,810 M). Adjusted for currency movements net sales increased by 2%, of which net sales of machines were flat and service sales increased by 14%.

It is a vital next step in the manufacturer’s electrification journey and a testament to its commitment to achieving net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, as validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.\\r\\nCarolina Diez Ferrer, Head of Advanced Engineering Programs, at Volvo CE, says: “We are already delivering electric solutions that offer zero exhaust emissions, reduced noise, and a much more comfortable work environment, but that is only half the challenge. We are committed to also helping our customers reach their own climate goals through complete site solutions with a holistic sustainable approach. This exciting partnership allows for a comprehensive investigation into the varied infrastructure and support system needs for electric machines to really perform to their best, no matter the task at hand.”\\r\\n“We are committed to also helping our customers reach their own climate goals through complete site solutions with a holistic sustainable approach” says Carolina Diez Ferrer, here at one of the construction sites in Gothenburg, Färjenäsparken.\\r\\nInnovation powered by partnership\\r\\nE-Worksite is a long-running research project that explores the site requirements for electromobility over the next two years across a variety of different applications. It has now completed the development of a new recreation area within the major city park Färjenäsparken and is currently working on the redesign of the Drottningtorget city square, both in the heart of Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden. Here, the customer transformation from diesel machines into more sustainable environmental solutions is guided by a fully holistic exploration of every aspect of site management. The project is funded by the Swedish Energy Agency, with Volvo CE working in close collaboration with Gothenburg City, NCC, Gothenburg Energy, Lindholmen Science Park, Chalmers University of Technology and ABB Electrification Sweden, among many others to conduct a largescale machine demonstration in Gothenburg.\\r\\nPeter Lindgren, Business Developer Electrified Transports at the City of Gothenburg Urban Transport Administration, says: “To achieve the City of Gothenburg’s climate goals we need to reduce greenhouse gases and we see that electric construction machines will help us in this environmental work by reducing local emissions of both nitrogen oxides and particles, as well as noise. The partnership as part of the Electric Worksite is of great value and we see that this research project has the capacity required to speed up our green transformation”.\\r\\nIn the heart of Gothenburg, Sweden’s second largest city, is the central square Drottningtorget where the L25 electric is being put to the test, offering zero exhaust emissions, reduced noise, and a much more comfortable work environment.\\r\\nIn this first phase, a number of electric machines already available to buy on the market are being put to the test, including the L25 Electric wheel loader and ECR25 Electric excavator, which are carrying out minor construction work, material moving and landscaping. A larger 30-tonne grid-connected excavator will be tasked with more energy-demanding jobs at different construction sites, to start in spring next year.\\r\\nNo one size fits all\\r\\nProject planners are answering questions such as how to ensure best value for money for customers and what are the most energy efficient methods of supplying electricity to power the machines. Beyond the technology itself, business models, infrastructure and support systems, regulatory frameworks and a mindset change are all required on the road to full acceptance. It is a complex puzzle to solve as there will be no one size fits all. The findings will prove important not only for municipalities in deciding how to develop the appropriate legislation, but also for industry partners in bringing technical solutions to market – both in the immediate future and over the next two decades.\\r\\n“We want to collectively take on the complex task of understanding the electric ecosystem and guide our customers on how best to move forward in this transition” says Niklas Lindblom, Project Manager at Advanced Engineering Programs, Volvo CE. “Through this partnership we will be connecting all parts of the customer value chain in order to build up shared knowledge and innovation capabilities to ensure our electric future is fit for any construction challenge.”\\r\\nThe L25 Electric offers zero exhaust emissions and low noise.\\r\\nLaunching the project in an urban application allows for a demonstration of the advantages electric machines bring to city life – low noise, low emissions and a much more peaceful environment for society in general.', 'Never one to do things by halves, Germany’s largest municipal waste management company, BSR, is leading the way with the purchase of nine Volvo L25 Electric wheel loaders. The 5-ton electric machines are being put through their paces across several BSR sites in the Berlin metropolitan area, helping the city keep its streets and sidewalks clean and clear, pushing waste from the city’s 26,000 garbage bins into boxes and transferring the waste to compacting containers. In the winter, the machines are also helping with the important role of keeping Berlin’s roads free of snow and ice, loading de-icing salt and gravel for the city’s grit spreaders.\\r\\nWith full power and the wide bucket, wet autumn leaves are no match for the L25 Electric wheel loader\\r\\nArvid Rüster, Product Manager at BSR, comments: “We saw the Volvo L25 Electric wheel loader at the 2019 Bauma trade fair in Munich and were immediately impressed with it. No noise, no exhaust fumes, no particulate matter. We had to order some!”\\r\\nRüster is a Product Manager responsible for sweeping and construction machinery in BSR’s fleet of around 1,800 vehicles and machines. The fleet includes everything from cars and vans to refuse trucks and sweepers, and even encompasses wheel loaders, bulldozers and excavators. Some 230 of these machines are already electric-powered, among them are waste collection vehicles with fuel-assisted electric drives, which BSR put into service via the German Ministry of Transport’s ‘Clean Air’ program. This is also the case for the nine L25 Electric wheel loaders. In this way, the federal government bears much of the additional cost for the electric drive.\\r\\nKai Groth, Head of BSR’s Product Management department, believes that ongoing political support and subsidies are important to make electrification of fleets economically viable in the long-term, without the need to raise waste disposal charges in Berlin. Groth is anticipating longer usage times, lower operating costs and less maintenance for the electric wheel loaders.\\r\\nThe L25 Electric wheel loader transports waste from 26,000 garbage bins in the city into compacting containers\\r\\nBerlin is fit for the future\\r\\nElectromobility has been on the radar at BSR for some time and the company has been developing an intelligent network of charging infrastructure since 2018. Today, a variety of electric vehicles, electric transporters and the new L25 Electric wheel loaders can dock with their On Board charger and recharge sufficiently overnight. In addition, BSR has purchased external fast chargers for the L25 Electric wheel loaders, which enable the machines to be charged from 0 – 100% at 400V in just two hours.\\r\\n“The L25 Electric wheel loader has a battery capacity of 40 kWh, and this is sufficient for us. The machines are rarely in use for more than one or two hours a day, so they still have enough remaining capacity”, assures Rüster.\\r\\nIt was the ease of operation and intuitive interface, however, that were the deciding factors for Rüster. Not every depot has permanent staff, and it is imperative that the BSR operators are able to operate the all-electric wheel loaders. Around 60 employees have received instruction on the new technology, and all are impressed by its performance. The operators are particularly enthusiastic about how much quieter their working days are with the near-silent operation of the L25 Electric wheel loader and can no longer imagine switching back to a diesel alternative.\\r\\nOnce the work is complete, Nico Ast connects his L25 Electric wheel loader to the charger\\r\\nQuiet yet powerful\\r\\nNico Ast, a BSR employee for 21 years, has already made friends with the L25 Electric wheel loader and is really putting it through its paces this Autumn, pushing wet, heavy leaves together with the 1.8 m wide wheel loader bucket.\\r\\nAst says: “Pushing leaves really shows off its power. The L25 Electric wheel loader is stronger than and superior to its diesel brother.” It is quieter and quicker to respond, he adds. The joystick control is also very sensitive. The only thing he still needs to get used to is just how quiet the whirring of the electric motor is. “Given a choice, I would always opt for the electric wheel loader,” the experienced BSR operator says.\\r\\nWhen the work is done, Ast heads for one of the 14 charging points at the BSR headquarters in Berlin Tempelhof and in just a few simple steps he connects the L25 Electric wheel loader to the power socket for recharging, so the machine is ready to go again tomorrow.\\r\\nWhile electric machines require less servicing than their traditional counterparts, they do need servicing, which is where the specialist expertise of dealer, Swecon Baumaschinen GmbH comes in and the service department in Berlin is well prepared for all service requests.\\r\\nArvid Rüster, Nico Ast and Kai Groth (from left to right)\\r\\nAbout BSR\\r\\nBerliner Stadtreinigung (BSR) is a public institution wholly owned by the federal state of Berlin. Its task is to keep Germany’s capital city clear of resident’s refuse, recycle waste and take care of street cleaning and winter services. It employs around 6,000 people across almost 60 sites. BSR has a fleet of around 1,800 vehicles and machines, 230 of which are already powered by electric. The company has voluntarily committed to protect the environment and climate and was the first state-owned company to enter into a climate protection agreement with the federal state of Berlin 15 years’ ago. This has been extended for a third consecutive time, with the current goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 67,000 tonnes per year by 2025. Increasing the fleet of gas and electric powered vehicles will help to achieve this. By 2050, the capital city aims to be climate neutral and BSR will operate an alternatively powered fleet of vehicles.', \"The unique research project Remote Timber is a collaboration between Volvo CE and the telecom operator Telia, timber and paper manufacturer SCA, Mid University Sweden, Skogforsk and Biometria. This week's tests at SCA's timber terminal in Torsboda, Sweden, have demonstrated that it is possible to tele-operate a Volvo L180 High-lift wheel loader, hundreds of kilometers away. And by using a closed 5G network, low latency has proven to be a major advantage – allowing operators to perform the sensitive process of picking, loading and organizing logs remotely.\\r\\nTele-operated forestry is expected to deliver improved productivity by allowing one operator to work across multiple – and sometimes isolated – sites around the world. It is also expected to make it both safer, by removing humans from potentially hazardous environments, and more sustainable, through more efficient logistics flows as the loading and unloading of timber can also be done during the night.\\r\\nChristian Spjutare, Advanced Engineering Program Manager at Volvo CE, says: “We expect tele-operation to open up far greater opportunities for operators than is currently available. Sometimes it can be difficult to hire people in timber terminals because of their remote locations. But tele-operation allows people to work from any location, no matter the distance, making it a more desirable work setting, with the added advantage of more efficient and sustainable work logistics.”\\r\\nMagnus Leonhardt, Director, Head of Business Development & Innovation at Telia adds: “This partnership is a fine example of how remote control with the latest technology can contribute to more efficient and sustainable construction solutions in the forestry industry. A secure and robust digital infrastructure is crucial for this. The unique technical qualities that 5G offers are also entirely critical, in which extremely quick response times and high capacity enable immediate feedback between operator and machine, which is a prerequisite for being able to safely control machines remotely.”\\r\\nWith a 5G network the response time is extremely low and the high capacity enables immediate feedback.\\r\\nRemote precision in its grasp\\r\\nAn important aim of this research project is to explore exactly what is required from an operator perspective in making tele-operation a user-friendly and efficient experience. Because each load of timber can be so varied – from an unwieldly pile of heavy logs through to just a few short pieces of wood – it is vital that the lifting process is carried out with pinpoint accuracy and incredibly precise handling.\\r\\nAs a result, there are currently a number of connected cameras and sensors located at strategic points around the machine that transmit real-time data via the Telia 5G network back to the control station. The test will therefor both explore how to mature the technology and gather vital feedback from the operators on the optimum placement of those cameras for handling precision.\\r\\nFeedback from operators is vital for developing the tele-operation system. Here, from the control station at Torsboda Timber terminal.\\r\\nVolvo CE has for the past few years been exploring the potential for tele-operation across a variety of segments from mining to urban construction, with this project testing the technology in its most challenging application yet. By remote-controlling processes like timber lifting – which are currently too complex to be fully automated – tele-operation becomes an important enabler for automation, allowing for a more gradual integration of automated processes for customers.\\r\\n“This research project gives us an opportunity to test our teleoperation platform in a new application with high precision requirements and learn how the system needs to be designed to meet industry needs. Insights from partial manual and tele-operated management enables us to also take steps towards automation in more complex processes”, Christian concludes.\\r\\nRemote Timber is financed by the participating parties and by VINNOVA’s vehicle strategic research and innovation (FFI) program.\", 'Inspired by a concept devised by Volvo CE and LEGO® Technic engineers and designers, the Volvo LX03 is a remarkable milestone breaking new grounds in smart construction technology. It represents both the next stage in Volvo CE’s exploration into machine intelligence and its determination to decarbonize the construction industry.\\r\\nMelker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “We need to transform the construction industry with smart and more sustainable solutions that will have an impact on a global scale. The unveiling of the LX03 prototype today represents just that – and is testament to the incredible expertise of our engineers and our united commitment towards positive change.

After several years of high demand for construction equipment in China, orders in the market there have declined by 26% as reduced government investments has led to lower construction activity. This has been more than offset by a good development in Europe, North America and other parts of the world. Order intake remains stable on a high level.\\r\\nNet sales in the third quarter increased by 11% to SEK 19,638 M, from SEK 17,619 M in 2020. When adjusted for currency movements they were also up by 11% in the same period, of which net sales of machines increased by 11% and service sales by 13% - reflecting Volvo CE’s increased focus on services. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 2,635 M, compared to SEK 1,963 M in the same quarter 2020 and corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 13.4% (11.1%).\\r\\nDespite a continued rise in interest for Volvo branded products across all other regions, order intake for Q3 remained flat, though still high. Together with a 9% reduction in deliveries, this is largely driven by the sudden decline in the China market.\\r\\nMarket Development\\r\\nAcross both the European and the North American markets, demand has remained high – the latter thanks to high infrastructure investments and housing construction activity. Asia, excluding China, showed good improvements particularly across South Korea and South East Asia. Continuing uncertainty across market forecasts remains significant due to the inability to predict supply chain capacity and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\\r\\nMelker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, says: “Despite industry-wide challenges of supply and delivery constraints, the power of Volvo CE as a truly global leader is clear to see in today’s quarterly results. While sales in China have dipped, the strength of sales in other regions has ensured we have remained at peak performance. This quarter has also demonstrated our leading focus on sustainable power, with several exciting launches and events, ensuring we keep a strong focus on building a brighter future.”\\r\\nWith the launch of three new electric compact machines and the reveal of the world’s first fossil-free steel prototype vehicle this quarter, Volvo CE is now not only the manufacturer with the largest range of commercially available electric machines, but is also taking big strides forward in accelerating more sustainable products, services and processes across the supply chain.

The two existing models are already established on the market and are proving to bring power and performance in a more environmentally sensitive package. The three new models represent the latest additions to Volvo CE’s industry-first commitment to move its range of Volvo branded compact wheel loaders and compact excavators to electric and stop development of new diesel variants. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe L20 Electric is a proven concept based on the larger L25 Electric model. It features a 1.8-ton payload and a parallel-type linkage offering great visibility over the attachment being used, outstanding lifting height, as well as 100% parallel movements – making it a perfect fit for fork applications too. Expected to deliver up to six hours of active work per charge, the electric machine comes with a choice of battery pack (33kWh or 40kWh) and reduces maintenance by 30%. As well as the more peaceful working conditions offered by its near-silence, operating comfort is also enhanced thanks to the new automatic park brake with hill-hold functionality and a range of customizable work modes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short but tough 1.8-ton ECR18 Electric is set to provide the same best-in-class stability and operator experience customers expect from its diesel counterpart but with the benefit of low noise, low vibration and more responsive hydraulics due to the immediate torque. Delivering an anticipated four hours of active work per charge, depending on the environment and task in hand, the ECR18 Electric also benefits from an ultra-short tail radius (perfect for confined spaces). It has been built with durability in mind – from its high profile counterweight to all-round steel panels and hoses routed inside the boom.\\r\\n\\r\\nEasy to operate and transport, the nimble EC18 Electric offers customers a cost-efficient compact excavator working in 1.8-ton applications. Its variable undercarriage retracts to less than 1m and expands up to 1.35m, allowing it to squeeze into the tightest of areas, while the machine’s design ensures the right frame corner, swing post and cylinder stay within the tracks’ width, resulting in maximum visibility and a reduced risk of machine damage when working alongside obstacles. As well as ergonomic controls, a spacious cab and a range of customizable settings, it also offers the option of an enclosed and heated cab.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll three machines come with an integrated on-board charger allowing them to charge from 0 to 100% in under six hours.

', 'As a part of its continuous pursuit of ground-breaking machine innovation, Volvo Construction Equipment unveiled its CX01 single-drum asphalt compactor concept at The Utility Expo in Louisville, Kentucky.\\r\\nThe CX01 concept utilizes one vibratory asphalt compactor drum that’s actually two independent halves (called a split-drum) kept upright by a self-balancing control system. Capable of being operated either by remote-control or entirely autonomously, the machine is also fitted with both a diesel engine and an energy storage system, making it a flexible electric hybrid solution. It can be operated in diesel-only, hybrid or fully electric modes.\\r\\nProving Volvo CE’s capacity for innovation across a variety of segments, this concept machine is the latest in the Concept Lab family of prototype machines that push the boundaries of conventional construction equipment.\\r\\n“While the CX01 is a conceptual product, the research and development that have gone into it will benefit customers in other ways,” said Justin Zupanc, Head of the Asphalt Compaction Development Team, Volvo CE. “It’s exciting for our engineers to push themselves to develop new and innovative ideas, and we’ve had personnel from the U.S. and Europe involved in the design, build and test phases of this concept.”\\r\\nCustomer-centered design\\r\\nThe CX01 concept provides an opportunity to fundamentally rethink the paving process to address customer needs, both improving the conditions for the operator and increasing productivity. By redesigning the compactors themselves, the operator is removed from the unit — reducing exposure to vibration, noise, dust and other associated environmental conditions — and freed up to autonomously control a fleet of CX units working together to compact asphalt surfaces.\\r\\nA fleet of these units deployed on larger jobs could work together and communicate not only between each CX unit but also to other pieces of equipment on the site. The machines could survey the jobsite, report on the conditions of the mat — things like density, temperature and passes — and determine when and where to compact.\\r\\nCompaction cycles can be streamlined, costs reduced and more agile work patterns set up, thanks to the machine’s compact design and precise maneuverability. Rolling pattern, weight and number of rollers can all easily be adjusted to match the width, thickness and speed of paving operation — providing a complete paving solution for whatever the job might be, from light infrastructure to highway construction. The CX01 can be matched with Volvo’s existing Co-Pilot system so that all work can be handled remotely via a touchscreen interface. In addition, it uses GPS position tracking to monitor job performance and help customers better hit their productivity targets.\\r\\nWhile the CX01 concept has been purely an exploration, some learnings could be applied to future products.\\r\\n“Remote control and autonomous operations are areas of focus for us in R&D. Also, while the low-friction water reduction coating on the drum shell is theoretical, it could be a huge benefit on larger machines to decrease the amount of water needed,” Zupanc said. “It is exciting to think how the theories showcased on the CX01 could be realized on compaction production units in the future.”\\r\\nAttendees of The Utility Expo in Louisville have an opportunity to see the CX01 compactor concept up close in the Volvo booth, K129 , and a machine walkaround will be held Sept. 28 as part of the company’s virtual experience .', 'Devised by engineering experts from both Volvo CE and the LEGO Group, the challenge was proposed to a dedicated team of young robotics students from FIRST® LEGO® League teams, to move the world’s biggest articulated hauler, the Volvo A60H – a 43 ton hauler loaded with an extra 45 tons of rocks – across a distance of 50 meters, using only LEGO Technic® elements. In a bid to showcase the incredible potential of STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) brainpower, it was not a task that could be easily solved.\\r\\nYet earlier this year via a nailbiting livestream, that same team of 35 budding engineers watched nervously from all corners of the world to see if the clever solution they had spent hours of deliberation on would succeed. And it did. Using a total of 728,168 LEGO® Technic pieces connected together under a layer of steel plates and transmitting signals to 1,920 motors, the children created enough power on their rolling motorized grid to pull the machine’s six heavy-duty wheels across the required distance in just 30 minutes.\\r\\nFrida Jönsson, Engineer at Volvo CE, who has been involved in the scheme from the very start, says: “The students showed incredible resilience and tenacity. In total they spent more than 2,000 hours of their own time to come up with a hard-fought solution that could create a pulling force of 10,000 Newtons in order to get the hauler moving.\\r\\n“Despite their plans very literally turning to ashes on the first attempt (when a fire broke out forcing them back to the drawing board) the teams showed that with collaboration, teamwork and a good dose of creativity, you can always find a way to succeed. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t moved to tears by the pride and sheer joy you could see from the teams when they realized their hard work had paid off.”\\r\\nRemote working was no barrier for the budding engineers to solve the MOVE IT challenge\\r\\nIn for the long haul\\r\\nOver three months, four teams of children from all backgrounds all over the world – US, Sweden, Japan and Nigeria – collaborated across time zones, language barriers and a distance of 32,000 kilometers to work on this engineering challenge. Each team was sent the 2,193-piece LEGO® Technic model version of the real Volvo A60H articulated hauler and given 12 weeks to find a way to build a prototype LEGO® Technic model that could be strong enough to move the 43-ton heavyweight. And just to make the task even harder, an extra 45 tons of rocks were added to the machine.\\r\\nThe robust A60H, which loads 34 cubic meters and is durable enough to carry 55 tons, is used to hauling heavy loads in the most challenging of off-road conditions. But on this occasion, it was simply along for the ride.\\r\\nAt a time when getting a good network during a video conferencing call seems enough of a challenge, this team of young geniuses proved that remote working is no barrier to being able to brainstorm ideas and come to a viable solution.\\r\\n“Our aim is to stimulate a love of STEM and showcase that there really is no limit to what the next generation of engineers can achieve if they put their minds together,” says Arvid Rinaldo, Brand Partnership at Volvo CE. “Using only online discussions, these incredibly smart people were able to solve our challenge without even meeting in person. We had set out to educate and motivate young people, but knowing how to solve complicated tasks like this without ever seeing each other is something we all need to learn in business and something they demonstrated with ease.”\\r\\nThe final set-up was viewed remotely by the team of young people around the world\\r\\nThey worked so well in fact that engineers had to increase the difficulty level of the challenge halfway through. Libor Udržal, Master Builder and Engineer at LEGO Group  says: “We actually had to put an additional 45 tons of rocks inside the hauler to make it more of a challenge! The motors in the LEGO Technic®  6x6 Volvo Articulated Hauler set are designed to move a weight around 3.6 kg but the hauler weighs over 11,000 times more than this. Even with my 20 years of experience, I would have felt daunted by the task in hand.”\\r\\nThis is not the first time the two major Scandinavian brands have teamed up with children to help solve engineering questions. Youngsters also played a vital role in the creation of an autonomous concept wheel loader back in 2018.\\r\\nTo watch this incredible feat in action and see exactly how it was done, click here: https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/our-offer/articulated-haulers/lego-heavyweight-challenge', \"Breaking new grounds for hydraulic efficiency in excavators, the Common Pressure Rail Hybrid system by Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE), is yet another innovation improving performance while reducing CO2 emissions in line with Volvo Group’s net zero value ambitions by 2040. \\r\\nThe Volvo CE team from Sweden and South Korea has worked closely with Finnish company Norrhydro in the research project, leveraging an idea initially born out of academic collaborations. Today, the innovation has matured into a real-world solution with ongoing customer trials in the field and it is expected to accelerate the introduction of e-mobility across Volvo CE’s larger excavator platform. The company anticipates the new technology to be available in the excavator market in a near future.\\r\\n“This innovation enables Volvo CE to offer its customers a truly unique electro-hydraulic solution, pushing fuel efficiency to new levels. It’s demonstrating the passion of our engineers to bring forward customer-oriented solutions and systems that will drive the transformation towards net-zero emissions operations. Also, it’s again an example of our strength working in partnerships and achieving amazing results”, says Lars Stenqvist, CTO Volvo Group.\\r\\nHow it works\\r\\nThe innovation enables new ways to reduce energy losses in hydraulics. In the new system architecture all the machine's work functions are connected to a hydraulic energy storage via a common pressure rail, comprised by two or more pressure lines. The energy storage, which consists of hydraulic accumulators, enables energy-efficient recovery of kinetic energy and peak power supply. For cylinder-driven functions, so-called “smart actuators” are used to achieve energy-efficient conversion from hydraulic power to a variable force and speed. The system also allows energy recovery and performance increase of the machine's rotating loads, such as the swing function through the introduction of variable hydraulic machines. Thanks to greatly reduced energy losses and the power contribution from hydraulic accumulators, a smaller power source can be used and the need for cooling is reduced. With a higher available power, cycle times can be shortened, for example when loading a truck, which contributes to both efficiency increases and cost benefits for the customer.\\r\\n“We are really proud of this recognition, which we share with our collaboration partners”, says Kim Heybroek, Volvo CE Emerging Technologies Research Engineer and a member of the winning team. “The potential in the innovation has been a strong driver for us in the project, making it an exciting journey to be part of, as we see the significant benefits it will offer for our customers and help build the world we want to live in.”\\r\\nThe Volvo Technology Award is a mark of recognition for outstanding technical advances that contribute to the enhancement of the Volvo Group’s high-tech competitiveness and technological expertise. Previous recipients have included world-famous innovations such as the Duo-Prop marine drive, the City Filter used to purify trucks and bus exhausts, Volvo’s side airbags (SIPS) and the Electric Site emission free quarry research project.\\r\\nThe winners of the Volvo Technology Award 2021 are:\\r\\nKim Heybroek, Sangki Bae, Junwoo Kim, Byeongmo Ko, Donghun Oh, Wonkil Choe, Wontaek Oh and Namgyu Kim.\\r\\nRead more about the partnership with Norrhydro: Pioneering electro-hydraulic solution significantly improving fuel efficiency in construction equipment\", 'Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has a commitment to reach net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Developing battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric technology will go a long way to deliver on that ambition, but for a construction company today, there is much more to do to drive industry change. Let’s look at some of the other significant actions that are required on our collective journey to a carbon neutral future.\\r\\n1. GET EVERYONE ON THE CARBON REDUCTION PATHWAY\\r\\n“Perhaps the biggest hurdle ahead for us humans lies in changing mindsets. Combating climate change is not only about advancements in technology. We all need to do this together, think differently and change our behaviors and ways of working,” explains Niklas Nillroth, Head of Sustainability and Public Affairs at Volvo CE.\\r\\nOnce a niche responsibility area, carbon reduction efforts now need to be the responsibility of each individual across an organization’s value chain with all parties having an important role to play. At Volvo CE, an inclusive culture and shared ownership form a foundation to driving that change, with employees educated and encouraged to think about how their actions impact the carbon footprint, and how they can make a real difference, big or small. Empowerment like this will accelerate change.\\r\\n“Climate change is real and one of the greatest challenges of our time. As a world leading manufacturer, we not only have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, we also have the clear vision, determination and talents to drive this transformation that is so urgently needed now. The choices we make today will form the world tomorrow – and we choose to act,” concludes Melker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE. \\r\\n2. TAKE ACTION ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH A CIRCULAR APPROACH\\r\\nManufacturing is one of the largest single emitters of greenhouse gases in Europe, responsible for some 880 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents a year. As part of its Science Based Targets goals, Volvo CE has set itself the challenge to reduce CO2 emissions in its own operations by 50% by 2030. We know that reducing our vehicles’ emissions through electric solutions is integral to our carbon neutral ambitions, but we cannot forget the importance of our manufacturing processes.\\r\\nA circular economy approach will be vital here to shift from the linear ‘take, make, waste’ production and consumption model to a more sustainable value chain that designs out waste and pollution, bolsters competitive agility and drives new value. As well as incorporating recycled components for parts supply and manufacturing, Volvo Reman solution is focused on extending and optimizing the life of its machines by refurbishing and refining them to deliver like-new service. The end goal being to deliver a truly circular vehicle or machine that uses renewable energy efficiently, is built without waste, has maximum uptime and an optimal lifespan.\\r\\nThe circular economy approach for sustainable construction manufacturing\\r\\n3. LEVERAGE THE POWER OF PARTNERSHIPS\\r\\nReal transformation requires a more cohesive, cooperative way of thinking. As Brunno Muller, Head of Advanced Manufacturing Engineering and Research at Volvo CE, says: “We cannot build the future we want by ourselves. We need to consider how we do this end-to-end, joining forces with partners and sharing experiences.”\\r\\nWhether that’s working with customers on test pilots to consistently improve the power of new technologies and products, through to collaborating with suppliers to source the best, most sustainable parts and processes, we need to partner with a range of groups from across our business and supply chain if we are to accelerate sustainable solutions. All actors in society need to come together - corporations, academia, policy-makers, and municipality leaders - to accelerate in important areas such as technology adaption, infrastructure and legislative transformation. With our combined expertise, we will be best placed to find new ways of working and to accelerate the changes needed for our carbon neutral future.\\r\\n4. USE DATA TO DELIVER ON SUSTAINABILITY GOALS\\r\\nAccording to a recent report by the World Economic Forum, most of the data in the world (90%) was generated in the last two years. Harnessing the full power of this data is the challenge. With more than 150,000 connected vehicles and machines, Volvo CE is using the data it collects from customers across the globe to deliver improvements in safety, uptime and fuel efficiency, for today and tomorrow. New digital services, like Efficient Load Out, are making it possible for trucks and excavators to communicate more effectively with one another on the job site. By doing so it ensures trucks only depart for their destination once a goal weight has been reached, thereby reducing the number of trips and in turn reducing the associated emissions.\\r\\nThe connected solutions we have made available today, and those that we are working on for tomorrow, allow our machines to operate in the most sustainable way possible. All of these incremental improvements combine to deliver energy efficiencies across all types of machines, whether they are electric or not – a vital step forward in our ongoing journey towards a carbon neutral future.', 'Electric machines may be the face of our net-zero future, but when it comes to a more sustainable way of working the real heart of a construction site is the connectivity that is filtering the numbers, pumping out vital information to every part of the site and keeping operations flowing smoothly. Being part of this digital ecosystem is not only a vital tool to achieving our goal of building a better world, by unlocking efficiencies right across the value chain, but also allows for more effective communication in our individual roles. We are only just scratching the surface of what technology can achieve, but let’s look at some of the most recent innovations significantly contributing to increased safety, uptime and fuel efficiency.\\r\\nPrevent downtime with virtual real-time tech support\\r\\nTo diagnose and resolve potential machine issues even faster than before, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is enabling dealer field technicians to connect directly to their back office product specialists, as well as Volvo product experts and engineers, through live augmented reality video feeds. Via a Real-time Tech Support app on their mobile phone, field technicians can initiate an interactive video call with their dealer back-office staff and invite a Volvo product expert and engineer, if required, to provide more expertise in diagnosing and resolving an issue. Preventing frustrating downtime for the customer and multiple visits to the jobsite for field technicians, this new support speeds up fault-tracing, minimizes travel and gets the machine back on the job much sooner.\\r\\n2. Reduce transport emission with efficient loading\\r\\nAs part of a new digital service called Efficient Load Out, trucks and excavators are now able to communicate more effectively with each other on the job site, increasing the efficiency of their work flow and therefore reducing transport emissions. After successful field tests with construction company NCC, a first for this type of service, it proved possible to secure between 96% and 100% load utilization for each transport, compared to the typical 87%. Data shows that 350,000 tons have been excavated and transported in 11,000 trips during the pilot run. The connected process helped reduce the number of trips by 1,600 – and it’s expected to save around 8,000 transports once the whole project is completed. When both excavator operators and truck drivers are logged in to the system, a notification alerts the excavator operator when there is a truck available for loading nearby. During the loading process, the excavator measures the weight of the load to the most accurate degree and only once the goal weight is reached, is the truck driver told to drive to its specific destination. There is also significant value in being able to access all load data through the cloud based portal – allowing for convenient monitoring to ensure the project delivers on time. And without the need for administrators to manage this process, it allows for a significant cost saving.\\r\\n3. Automated grading for double the productivity\\r\\nThe perfect grade is in reach with an ingenius machine control system that automates boom and bucket movements to achieve the exact depth and angle at the touch of a button. Volvo Active Control boosts digging accuracy allowing jobs to be completed up to 45% faster. With single-lever grading, the arm speed is manually adjusted by the operator while the machine automatically adjusts boom and bucket movements to maintain an even grade and create the desired shape. The steer-by-wire solution can also easily set swing fence, height limit and depth limit to avoid contact with side obstacles, overhead obstacles such as power lines, and underground hazards such as pipes and cables. All of which not only helps operators be more productive behind the wheel, but also makes construction sites that much safer. \\r\\n4. Stay on top of fleet management\\r\\nIt’s easy for fleet managers to become overwhelmed by the mass of data being produced by modern construction machines. What good are all these numbers if it’s not easy to make sense of them and take actionable insights to improve the work environment? Volvo ACTIVE CARE has been rolled out globally to proactively take on the burden of monitoring and reporting machine health, freeing customers to get on with the job in hand. It is an intelligent telematics service that bundles together the monitoring of machine health and the provision of weekly reports that together help reduce downtime. Remote analysis delivers multiple benefits, including catching problems before they become failures and helping smooth service scheduling. By knowing what the problem is, dealer technicians need to make fewer trips to the customer site and arrive with the right tools, parts and expertise to increase the opportunity for a first visit fix. This all amounts to increased uptime and reduced cost for the customer.\\r\\n5. Get the full view with 3D modelling\\r\\nVolvo CE’s Dig Assist machine control application for excavators has been updated with new features that make it even faster and easier to create plans and put more information at operators’ fingertips – raising the bar once again on productivity, efficiency and safety in digging operations. Via the Dig Assist app on the Volvo Co-Pilot interface, operators can choose from 2D, In-Field Design and 3D tools right from the comfort of the cab. While the 2D app is intended for site levelling and profiling slopes, and the In-Field Design option allows operators to go from a paper drawing to a digital excavation model in minutes via GNSS and RTK navigation technology, it is the 3D option that is the ideal choice for complex and larger infrastructure projects. Providing full three-dimensional functionality, Topcon 3D-MC and Trimble Earthworks for Dig Assist allow designs to be uploaded directly into the Volvo Co-Pilot – this ability to offer both solutions is unique to Volvo. Simply import a project file and get to work.\\r\\n6. Reach the next level with gamified Operator Training\\r\\nAn app which helps operators make small but important improvements every time is taking its cue from the world of gaming. Operator Coaching forms part of the Load Assist family and is now available in select markets across the world. The latest upgrade gives operators of Volvo’s L110H to L260H wheel loaders real-time information so that they can better understand how their actions influence output. A bit like chasing a top score on a computer game, the new feature allows operators to set targets and objectives for continual performance improvement. Even experienced and proficient operators benefit from the advantages of the new app, as early adopters have reported that it helps them to see their behaviour reflected back in a non-judgemental way, to analyze their productivity from a pure efficiency standpoint and then to suggest areas of improvement they would never have considered before. Operator Coaching is just one example of how gaming trends are influencing the world of construction.', 'Continuing its strong rebound from the challenges of last year all markets have enjoyed in uptick in sales from the same period 2020 – all except China which has seen a slight slowdown despite its initial surge of sales in the first three months of the year. With improved construction activity, high customer confidence and increased investment in infrastructure, order intake has also increased by 35%. Total net sales in the second quarter increased by 13% amounting to SEK 25,839 M (SEK 22,876 M in Q2 2020) – supported by a 17% rise in the sales of services. Adjusted for currency movements, however, net sales increased by 21%. Sales in Asia, including China, the world’s largest construction equipment market, remained the highest but still accounted for a 12% drop, due to a decline in infrastructure investment. Asia (excluding China) continued to solidify its growth with improvements in all key markets including India, Korea and South East Asia. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 3,374 M, up slightly from 3,108 M last year, corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 13.1% (13.6%).\\r\\nThanks to a more confident customer outlook and increased investment across most markets, order intake increased by 35% with a significant increase in orders for Volvo branded products and a more modest yet stable order intake in SDLG branded products, affected as they were by the slowdown in the Chinese market. Demand for large and medium sized machines remained strong and higher than for compact machines. Due in large part to higher sales in Europe and North and South America, the latter of which saw a 120% increase in deliveries from the same period last year, overall deliveries increased by 5% in Q2.\\r\\nMarket development\\r\\nThe year up to May has benefited from high customer activity across industry segments, more than positively impacted by increasing volumes in the European, North American and South American markets. In Europe, the majority of countries continued their recovery to see a 30% increase measured in units from the same period last year, while North America saw a 35% rise thanks to high infrastructure and housing construction activity. The South American market enjoyed the biggest surge (71%) due to an increased demand in commodities. Despite its strong start to the year, China began to decline in Q2 in line with decreasing government investment in infrastructure.\\r\\nMelker Jernberg, President of Volvo CE, said: “Thanks to our commitment to innovation and customer success, we have offset a slowdown in China with a solid increase in demand across our other key regions of Europe and North America. While maintaining a steady recovery from the challenges of last year remains our top priority, we have also continued our journey of innovation with a number of exciting launches this quarter, including our entry into the 50 ton excavator segment and the launch of our first dedicated Fuel Cell Test Lab.”\\r\\nTable 1.

To celebrate, a number of female heroes from Volvo CE across a variety of disciplines around the world are showing that gender does not put a limit on your ability to succeed in engineering.', 'With its commitment to Science Based Targets, Volvo CE is continuing its long-time focus on environmental care and driving industry transformation to combat climate change. \\r\\n  The target of net-zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 is a united commitment for Volvo Group across all business areas, and is set for 10 years earlier than the SBTi commitment. This is because Volvo products have an average lifetime of 10 years in the customer use-phase, so for the entire rolling fleet to have net-zero emissions by 2050, it is necessary that all products delivered after 2040 have net-zero emissions.\\r\\n  Volvo CE has also set its own high interim goals to be met by 2030, including cutting emissions in half in its own operations, facilities and manufacturing processes, and achieving 30% in absolute reductions in the use of its products, whose indirect emissions account for the highest proportion of the company’s carbon emissions. For the construction equipment industry, the majority of emissions are those referred to as indirect emissions, in other words the emissions created when the machines are being used as soon as they leave the factories. \\r\\n  Volvo CE President Melker Jernberg says: “Climate change is real and one of the greatest challenges of our time. As a world leading manufacturer, we not only have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, we also have the clear vision, determination and talents to drive this transformation that is so urgently needed now. The choices we make today, will form the world tomorrow – and we choose to act.” \\r\\n    STRONGER TOGETHER\\r\\n\\r\\nVolvo CE is already committed to decarbonization through its industry-leading technology development and engagement in climate change initiatives, such as the Construction Climate Challenge (CCC) and the WWF Climate Savers Program. With SBTi, it has another tool to make sure the reductions are aligned with the latest climate science to reach the Paris Agreement. \\r\\nThe company is taking a holistic approach to tackling climate change. It will follow its tried-and-tested innovation pathway of embracing the three streams of electromobility: battery-electric machines, hydrogen fuel-cell powered equipment and improved internal combustion engine solutions. It will also continue its work with industry-leading partnerships to accelerate development of new technologies, working together with customers to bring sustainable solutions to market and collaborating with dealers and suppliers to explore new ways of working.\\r\\n“New exciting technology is definitely one of the key ways to reduce carbon impact,” says Niklas Nillroth, Head of Sustainability and Public Affairs at Volvo CE. “However, another significant driver in achieving these targets will be a new level of collaboration, internally as well as externally though partnerships. Only with joint efforts, where each and every one of us takes responsibility for our part with a holistic mindset, will we be able to collectively reach these important goals. Together we help build the world we want to live in.”\\r\\nSBTi is a collaboration between CDP, United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It helps companies establish science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transform business operations to fit the future low-carbon economy. ']\n"
