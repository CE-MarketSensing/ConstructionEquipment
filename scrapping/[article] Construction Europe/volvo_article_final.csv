30 May 2023,World’s top ten construction OEMs revealed,"The latest Yellow Table, International Construction’s annual ranking of the world’s top 50 construction equipment manufacturers by sales figures, has revealed that sales for 2022 were US$230.6 billion, one of the highest figures ever recorded in the listing.
A large reason for this growth is the performance of manufacturers based in the US. OEMs based in the US accounted for over 26% of the total revenue of the Yellow Table, up from 21% in the last listing.
You can view the full Yellow Table in the latest issue of International Construction magazine with in-depth analysis.
The top ten biggest construction equipment manufacturers in the world for 2022 were:
10. JCB, UK
JCB enters the top ten for the first time in several years, with strong sales in the OEMs main market of India boosting its bottom line. The OEM is investing heavily into hydrogen technology.
9. Sandvik, Sweden
Another rise up the table for Sandvik – the company was at number ten last year. The company has been making numerous acquisitions, with the OEM making ten acquisitions in 2022, helping to explain their increased ranking.
8. Hitachi, Japan
Hitachi had construction equipment sales of US$9.2 billion, a steady increase from its final results last year. In 2022 the brand saw the ending of its joint venture with John Deere, with Hitachi Chairman Sonny Ishii saying at ConExpo that, “The Americas market is the single most important market, or priority, for Hitachi Construction Machinery.”
7. Liebherr, Germany
Liebherr saw good growth in 2022. In its own report it said that its construction and mining segments – earthmoving, material handling technology, deep foundation machines, mobile and crawler cranes, tower cranes, concrete technology and mining equipment – had an average increase in turnover of 6.9%. Liebherr says it is taking a technology-neutral approach to its research, which includes the increased use of hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVO), for potential use in construction equipment.
6.Volvo Construction Equipment
When adjusted for currency changes, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) had sales of US$9.9 billion keeping it in sixth place. The company is one of the leading OEMs when it comes to electric construction equipment, with one of the largest commercially available ranges including its new 23 ton battery electric excavator.
5. Sany, China
China-based Sany drop down one place in the table, from number four to number five. The Chinese construction market faced challenges in 2022 following on from two strong years so a general drop in China-based OEMs on the table was expected.
4. John Deere, US
US-based John Deere increased its ranking on the Yellow Table by one place, as it did in the previous Table. The company’s purchase of the Wirtgen Group has been a success and provided the company with access to new markets.
3. XCMG, China
Despite seeing sales fall, XCMG remains the world’s third largest OEM. As is the case with all major Chinese OEMs, the company is actively looking to increase its share of the international market and its most recent results showed record overseas sales. One of their leading executives believes that there is more growth to come in these markets.
2. Komatsu, Japan
Komatsu remains at number two on the list and has extended the gap between it and the rest of the table with sales that, when adjusted for currency, were similar to the last Yellow Table. The OEM recently announced the development of a medium-sized hydraulic excavator concept, powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The manufacturer said the machine’s development is in line with its aim to achieve carbon neutrality in construction equipment.
1. Caterpillar, US
Caterpillar retains its traditional position as the world’s biggest construction manufacturer with sales with sales of US$37.5 billion – approximately 16% of the total of the whole table. A senior executive at the OEM recently told International Construction about the OEMs plans regarding sustainability and new technology.

26 May 2023,Heavy wheeled loaders: The workhorse of the construction site,"Heavy wheeled loaders have a home in almost every construction site and operators are spoilt for choice with the innovative machines manufacturers are releasing.
Komatsu Europe displayed the new WA800-8 wheeled loader at the demo ground at Bauma Munich in October 2022. The loader is said to have been designed for maximum operating comfort in addition to featuring a modulation clutch, variable traction control, an auto kick down and an RPM set.
The Japan-based company has also redesigned the machine’s extra-large 11.5m³ bucket, complete with its optimised maximum fill feature.
With a total operating weight of 115 tonnes, the WA800-8 meets the latest EU stage V emission regulations with a Komatsu-designed, developed and manufactured engine and after-treatment system.
“Our WA800 has always been well-appreciated for its reliability and productivity”, says Jo Monsieur, group manager for large machines at Komatsu Europe.
“And this latest generation surely continues this legacy. Furthermore, Komatsu has really set new standards for stability, comfort and safety and we are very proud to be able to offer this to our customers.”
Liebherr’s XPower wheeled loaders have established themselves at the forefront of fuel efficiency and robustness.
Liebherr says one reason is their power-split travel drive, installed as standard in all Liebherr XPower wheeled loaders. The combination of hydrostatic drive – advantageous for material uptake and travelling over short distances – and mechanical drive ensure that the machine works at maximum efficiency.
In addition to the two drive types, Liebherr offers a range of intelligent assistance systems for its mid-size and XPower wheeled loaders, including active personnel detection with brake assistance. The optional assistance system warns the machine operator of hazards in the rear area of the machine. Sensors and artificial intelligence combine to distinguish between people and objects for additional safety. As soon as the sensors detect a source of danger, the brake assistant automatically decelerates the wheel loader‘s speed. This shortens the stopping distance by multiple feet, reducing the frequency and intensity of potential accidents.
In Denmark, 40 Liebherr XPower wheel loaders are being used for material handling at RGS Nordic – which specialises in recycling construction and demolition waste materials.
Michael Jørgensen, strategic purchasing manager, commented, “The Liebherr wheel loaders need less fuel, are powerful and have hardly any downtime. We are particularly impressed that we achieve 30% more productivity with the same fuel consumption than with comparable wheel loaders in this size class.”
RGS Nordic was in the market for efficient wheel loaders with power-split drive to reduce CO2 emissions. With the company’s main focus on converting construction waste into reusable and circular products that can be integrated into the product cycle, it was important for the machinery used to reflect the same values.
Develon, formerly known as Doosan Construction Equipment, now offers the company’s latest generation ‘DL-7’ wheel loader range driven by new Stage V compliant engines and providing higher productivity, increased fuel efficiency and a low cost of ownership, coupled with a new cab offering an enhanced experience for the operator.
The four biggest standard models in the DL-7 range are the DL420-7, DL480-7, DL550-7 and DL580-7. The machines feature redesigned buckets offering up to 7% more capacity with maximum bucket capacities from 4.5 to 6.4 m3. Develon says that this provides increased productivity for a wide range of material-handling applications.
In addition to the company’s wheel loader range, Develon has introduced the ‘world’s first “transparent bucket” system’ for wheel loaders. The system is said to enable the wheel loader driver to see the blind spots in front of the machine’s bucket, using a monitor installed in the cab. By recording images with top and bottom front-loaded cameras and projecting the combined images in real-time using a curved projection method, the transparent bucket system provides a full view for the driver.
Develon says that the transparent bucket system addresses the issue of safety concerns caused by blind spots in front of wheel loaders due to their buckets. With this new feature, drivers can now easily check blind spots in front of the bucket via the cab monitor, increasing safety and reducing accidents.
Moreover, the transparent bucket system is said to enhance work efficiency by providing a forward view for the driver during loading, unloading, or carrying materials like aggregates, sand, and soil.
The company has applied for patents in Korea, North America, Europe, and China, making it the first company to develop and implement a front projection function with a transparent bucket for construction machinery.
A Develon spokesperson stated that advanced safety systems have become crucial in equipment selection with increasing safety standards. The company plans to continue developing safety features that prioritise driver and worker safety, aiming to lead the industry towards safer and accident-free construction sites.
Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has taken a major step forward in advancing its electromobility offerings with a new solution.
The company has converted its L120 wheel loader into an electric version, catering to the increasing demand for sustainable solutions in the mid-size range. The conversion was done in collaboration with partners Parker Hannifin and CE Engineering Solutions, a Volvo Group subsidiary.
The L120H Electric Conversion, available to selected customers in Europe from 2023, will provide the same performance as the conventional machine while emitting zero emissions.
Volvo CE says that it is committed to achieving a carbon-neutral construction industry and has partnered with CE Engineering Solutions and other electromobility partners to accelerate the availability of commercialised electric solutions across all segments and applications. This collaboration is part of the company’s efforts to expand its line of electric wheel loaders, following its investment in Dutch manufacturer Limach in June to broaden its electric excavator portfolio.
The L120H Electric Conversion is expected to provide numerous benefits to the construction industry, including reduced noise pollution, lower operating costs, and increased productivity. The machine’s electric powertrain also offers instant torque, making it more responsive and efficient than traditional combustion engines.
In addition, the electric version is designed to require less maintenance than its diesel counterpart, reducing downtime and increasing overall equipment availability.
Powered by 240 kWh batteries, the L120H provides a runtime of approximately five hours in most medium-duty applications. Consistent with Volvo’s existing charging solutions, it is estimated to charge from 0-100% in just 1.5-2 hours.
Carl Slotte, head of sales region Europe at Volvo CE, says, “There is no time to wait – we need to deliver solutions that allow our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Change starts here.
“Our commitment to partnership allows us to take a leading position in transforming our industry, with electric solutions that are built to fulfil market demand and tailored to suit the changing needs of our customers. Working together, we are scaling up our portfolio of electric machines, extending the versatility of our range and transforming our industry towards a carbon-neutral future.”
Depending on market demand, Volvo CE says there could be the possibility to convert existing users’ L120H wheel loaders to electric in the future.
Beyond sustainability, Volvo CE is significantly developing the safety systems that are available on their wheeled loaders.
Volvo CE has launched its Collision Mitigation System for Volvo Wheel Loaders, which aims to support operator response and reduce the risk of collision when working in reverse. The feature automatically applies the service brakes when the wheel loader approaches an obstacle, helping to mitigate the consequences of accidents and reduce the risk of unplanned interruptions.
The system is designed to facilitate job site safety and remembers the last slope the machine climbed for seamless stockpiling operations. Volvo CE says that it can be temporarily deactivated for specific site conditions and only functions when the wheel loader is in reverse and driving between 3-15 km/h. The Collision Mitigation System is a factory-fit option for a range of Volvo wheel loaders and is available globally.
Lars Eriksson, global product manager for wheel loaders at Volvo CE says, “We at Volvo CE continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions which not only mitigate the consequences of accidents but strive to avoid them altogether.
“This new Collision Mitigation System is one important part of our work to reduce the risk of accidents and help fulfil our commitment towards zero accidents.”
Volvo CE has developed the Collision Mitigation System in-house for its line of wheel loaders. This factory-fit option is currently offered on the L110H/L120H equipped with OptiShift, L150H, L180H, L220H, L260H, and L200H High-Lift wheel loaders.
To function, it requires a Radar Detect System to be installed, adding to the existing range of features, options, and site services designed by Volvo CE to promote job site safety and reduce unforeseen interruptions.
The heavy wheeled loader market is certainly busy. Enhancements are being made left, right and centre with almost a solution for everything. As always, it is an exciting time in equipment development and the year is sure to bring about more innovations."
25 May 2023,Why electric machines could be a game changer for Chinese OEMs,"Forgive the generalization, but in the main there are no bad machines nowadays. Ironically, far from strengthening manufacturers’ hands, this universal competence has created its own problem – namely how can leading manufacturers retain their premium positions over ‘lesser’ brands?
Construction equipment has been on a path towards commoditization for many years, simultaneously increasing the importance of the dealer-customer relationship and challenging the premium positioned OEMs to find new ways to demonstrate their value to customers. The difference in performance and fuel efficiency between different brand and model machines has been declining. With only a few exceptions, increments in these key buying criteria now tend to be small, and price competition has been intense when supply is in balance with demand.
Of course, everyone understands change is afoot, and products powered with alternative energy sources are coming. By some counts, there are 20+ different potential energy sources that could make up the global portfolio of solutions across different locations and applications.
Electric products in their various forms (battery, fuel cell, etc.) will certainly be part of this change. So, why are we talking about electric products and commoditization at the same time? We believe that electric machines bring the potential to forestall the complete commoditization of the bulk of the construction equipment market for at least a decade.
The overall commoditization effect that we see in the traditional diesel products is the result of 70+ years of refinement of the same basic technologies – diesel engines applying power through mechanical geartrains and hydraulics. After seven decades of refinement of this package, even with the advent of software control, it is increasingly difficult to come up with something that the competition has also not thought of. It’s not just the powertrain, even the fundamental shape of machines is dictated by the physical constraints that these technologies bring.
Consider the backhoe loader – this machine is a 1950s adaptation of the humble farm tractor, where the loader is by necessity wrapped around the engine that sticks out the front of the machine, leaving the rear as the only logical place to put the backhoe. The tractor part itself is constrained by the need to fit an engine, transmission, and axle to drive the machine, while leaving a comfortable place for the operator to sit.
So, what happens when you remove the diesel engine and its need to have a relatively straight line to the axle, which needs a straight line to the wheels? While mechanical energy needs to route through rigid gears and shafts and hydraulics through relatively stiff hoses, electrical energy is transmitted through wires that can bend around corners. Perhaps even more importantly, there are countless ways to control these electric systems through software.
We have only begun to build these electrified machines. All are still in their infancy and most just substituting the diesel engine for a battery and some motors. There has been little work done to rethink the fundamental structure of the machine and to exploit the performance potential that a more software-controlled machine offers.
Further, battery electric componentry itself is quite immature, with significant – as yet untapped – opportunities to optimize batteries, fuel cells, motors, and their installation for specific machine types. This creates potential for an entirely new race to develop the best machine for each application – with the winners being those who figure out to get the best performance in the smallest and most energy efficient package.
Who is best positioned to win this race? As with the automotive sector, electrics’ relative simplicity compared to ICE combined with the consequent lower investment required, means that barriers to entry are falling. That said, the largest OEMs are aiming at gaining first mover advantage and trying to maintain or improve their current position in the new competitive hierarchy.
Chinese OEMs have not been able to make real progress penetrating the EU and NA markets but China has a significant head-start in electrification: if geopolitical considerations allow, could this rewriting of the rule book be the opportunity that enables Chinese OEMs to gain a significant market share foothold in the West?

22 May 2023,"Holcim orders up to 1,000 Volvo electric trucks","

Swiss-based building materials company Holcim has placed the biggest commercial order to date for Volvo electric trucks, deploying up to 1,000 by 2030.

Volvo will start delivery of the first trucks in the fourth quarter of this year.

The deal is part of a wider partnership between Holcim and Volvo Group to deploy electric trucks across Holcim’s operations in Europe between now and 2030.

Both companies are founding members of the First Movers Coalition (FMC), a coalition of companies that use their purchasing power to create early markets for innovative clean technologies.

The companies estimate that replacing diesel trucks with electric ones will reduce CO2 emissions from road transport by up to 50% per year.

Jan Jenisch, Holcim chairman and CEO said, “The net-zero transition requires deep collaboration across value chains. We are excited to be partnering with Volvo to decarbonize our European operations’ logistics with electric fleets, advancing our goal to reach 30% of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks by 2030.”

Martin Lundstedt, president & CEO Volvo Group added, “Long-term collaboration and a strong commitment to really make a difference are essential for making big CO2 reductions a reality. I’m very proud of the partnership we have developed with Holcim, and the results we are achieving together.”"
18 May 2023,Digging with a twist: What are the advantages of a tiltrotator?,"Popular in Scandinavia, and growing in other areas of Europe, the tiltrotator is deemed to significantly increase machine efficiency.
The tiltrotator can look like a confusing bit of kit but it is possible to think of it as a wrist that directly connects to the excavator’s arm or beneath the excavator’s quick hitch. The tiltrotator is then connected to the excavator’s hydraulics and electrical system. Depending on the excavator’s extra hydraulics, control is adapted to suit different types of control system.
In the early 1980s, the Norgrens family introduced the Tiltrotator to the Swedish market under their family-owned and operated company Noreco, and since then it has become a standard in the Scandinavian region. The concept has also recently gained popularity in many other countries across the globe, including the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the United States.
Sven-Roger Ekström, senior product manager at Rototilt, understands the capabilities of tiltrotators better than most and believes that they have several benefits that could change the way we work on construction sites.
Upon asking Ekström why everyone should have a tiltrotator, he reels off a list of what he believes are the key advantages. “Your excavator becomes an efficient tool carrier in addition to working faster and more flexibly with fewer machine movements.”
Ekström adds that such qualities allow companies to take on new types of jobs and will require less manual labour around the machine.
Unfortunately, the skills shortage is as much a concern as it was in 2022 and including a new attachment into the field can cause apprehension for potential buyers, who may be uncertain about imposing such a complex attachment on operators.
Ekström, however, says it takes only a short time to become proficient with a tiltrotator. “If you are a skilled excavator operator you will need 1-2 weeks to perform really well. After that first jumpstart, you will start to see new opportunities such as how to solve working tasks in a new way and become even more efficient.”
Stefan Stockhaus, CEO of Steelwrist, believes that tiltrotators are also the answer to increasing safety in potentially dangerous working conditions. By using tiltrotators, jobs traditionally done outside the cabin can be moved into the cabin, removing ground workers from risk-prone roles. “It’s not all about efficiency,” he says. “It’s also about safety and becomes an alternative to a standard factor.”
Increasing efficiency is undoubtedly a huge advantage on the modern-day construction site and Ekström says tiltrotators can increase efficiency by 25% to 30% depending on the type of job. “On some jobs where you, with the combination excavator plus tiltrotator, can do the same job as two or three standard excavators you of course calculate with even higher figures,” he adds.
Steelwrist’s Stockhaus agrees with Rototilt’s Ekström regarding his sentiments on the tiltrotators ability to increase efficiency, but he adds that enjoyment is also a benefit. “In our case, 96% of all the experienced users say that the job is more fun. And if the job is more fun, it’s easier to attract good employees. Those are two really strong cases. As I see it anyway – efficiency, profitability, but also more fun.”
Mature markets, such as Scandinavia, have embraced the adoption of tiltrotators. Almost 90% of excavators in the region have the attachment, which is said to be crucial to winning projects as well as meeting specific sustainability goals.
While Scandinavia has fully adopted this form of attachment, the rest of Europe is somewhat slower. “It always take time to break new ground and to change old habits,” says Ekström.
“In Scandinavia, we have a long practice of getting more efficient because of expensive, and the lack of manual labour. We also have a market with many small contractors that often see the owner in the cab working with the equipment; therefore, he can quickly see the benefit of working in a new way.”
Stockhaus believes the popularity surrounding tiltrotators in Scandinavia comes from the region’s pressure on increased productivity – it is also the key to getting jobs.
Elsewhere in Europe, Ekström says that big companies with a large rental market often take longer to see the benefits. Other obstacles, he says, can be that as long as the contractors are satisfied with buying two or three machines instead of one machine with a tiltrotator, the dealers will not push the product until the customer asks for it.
Autumn 2022 saw Rototilt launch its Rototilt Control product concept featuring tiltrotators, joysticks, a new control system and a remote support app. The product has become well established in the market and companies are starting to realise their potential – Rototilt are now expanding the number of tiltrotators in their RC series.
The company confirmed that Rototilt’s R4 and R8 tiltrotators will gain counterparts in the RC series launched at Bauma last year. This means that Rototilt’s new RC System control system and the new RC Joysticks will be available to machines weighing between 10 and 43 tonnes.
The R4 tiltrotator has historically been one of Rototilt’s most popular products, according to Ekström, who has high expectations ahead of the sales launch.
He says, “We started in the mid-range but are now expanding the concept to encompass both bigger and small machines. Today we are delighted to offer increased energy efficiency and an improved driving experience for a wider range of machines and users.”
The new tiltrotator series, due to launch in February 2023, features pressure-compensated hydraulics and is said to deliver greater energy efficiency than its predecessors, in addition to enabling more controlled excavation movements.
As part of a joint initiative, Steelwrist and Rototilt have come together to set an industry standard for fully automated quick couplers under the Open-S Alliance. The non-profit organisation sets out to develop and promote the Open-S standard, with the ultimate aim of achieving global interchangeability between quick couplers, tiltrotators and work tools for excavators.
The alliance’s standardisation work has been ongoing for the last two years with the purpose to increase safety and efficiency for excavator owners, operators and ground personnel.
The partnership has started to create a uniform manufacturing standard for dimensions and tolerances as well as making it cost efficient to retrofit adaptor brackets to used and new buckets and work tools.
In 2021, Volvo Construction Equipment became the first excavator specialist to join the alliance in hopes to work with other industry partners on improving work tools for excavators. The demand for fully automatic quick couplers on excavators has continued to grow rapidly in general construction and it is said that all partners are seeing opportunities for growth in a variety of sectors.
Steelwrist and Rototilt are paving the way for the future of tiltrotators, in addition to the likes of Volvo Construction Equipment and Caterpillar. Scandinavia needs no convincing evidence of the advantages of tiltrotators and it seems the rest of Europe is taking a particular interest in increasing efficiency.
Last year, Caterpillar Work Tools Division announced new Tilt Rotate System (TRS) models for Cat 302.7 through 310 Next Generation Mini Excavators.
The new TRS4 and TRS8 S45 plus updated TRS6 models allow attached work tools to rotate 360 degrees and tilt 40 degrees side-to-side. This enables the machine to reach more work areas from a single position, while manoeuvring tools over, under, and around obstructions when excavating, grading ditches, sorting recycled materials, or placing pipe.
The new TRS models are said to multiply the mini excavator’s versatility and are available in various configurations to match the application.
The TRS6 and TRS8 feature a standard TRSAux2 auxiliary port at the bottom to connect a variety for different hydraulic tools whilst the compact design of the TRS4, TRS6 and TRS8 allows the mini excavator to maintain high digging forces.
TRS4 models are designed for efficient use by the 302.7, 303, 303.5 and 304 Mini Excavators, while the TRS6 models are compatible with the 305.5CR and 306 CR models. The TRS8 models are designed for use with the 307.5, 308, 308.5, 309 and 310.
Engcon is seeing “stable profitability” after reporting record-high net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022.
While the last three months of 2022 saw the company’s order intake decline by 29% SEK553 million (€49.4 million), its net sales increased to SEK541 million (€48.3 million).
This is up 46% on the SEK370 million (€33 million) the company brought in for the same period in 2021 - with operating profits also up 57% on the previous year to SEK 121 million (€10.8 million).
Overall, this resulted in a fourth quarter profit rise of 20%, to SEK 90 million ($8.6 million), up from SEK75 million (€6.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Engcon’s fourth quarter results meant that for the whole of 2022 the company saw an order intake rise of 1%, up from SEK1.96 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.97 billion (€171.4 million).
2022 net sales also increased by 30%, from SEK1.48 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.93 billion ($186 million), with profits last year amounting to SEK325 million (€29.6 million) - a rise of 21%.
Krister Blomgren, Engcon’s CEO, said, “Combined with increased economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rates, this led to an expected downturn in Nordic and European markets in the fourth quarter compared with exceptional comparative figures. Despite this, the order intake was at a high level when seen from a long-term perspective.
“It is worth noting that there was a break in the trend in 2022, with growth markets recording higher order intake than the Nordic region for the first time.”
Looking to the future, Engcon plans to continue investing in its third generation tiltrotator system and expand its sales network.
"
16 May 2023,Why America is ready for electric construction equipment,"
North America is ready for electric construction equipment, contrary to perceptions in some quarters that appetite for the machines lags that in Europe.
That’s according to Stephen Roy, president of Volvo Construction Equipment, Americas, speaking to International Construction.
Roy said he was seeing pockets of demand for electric machines across the USA, and that it wasn’t just their lower carbon emissions that was generating interest but the lower levels of noise and vibration.
When asked if electrically powered machines were likely to prove less popular in the North American market than in Europe, Roy said, “There are parts of the European market that are more progressive than other parts of the European market, so it’s not even the same in Europe and I think it’s the same here.
“We have states with high population density and when you go further towards the West Coast you get a lot more focus on environmental standards and more early adopters.”
Roy said he saw the trend to electrically powered machines continuing in the compact equipment market but also moving into the mid-range. Volvo is already piloting its first larger electrified excavator, the 22t EC230 in markets including Finland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, and the machine is now making its way to North America.
“We have customers that are already ready to demo and get familiar with it and then we’ll start production for North America next year,” Roy said. “For the larger machines we see some alternative power solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen combustion engines”. The company already displayed a 30t prototype hydrogen fuel cell articulated hauler at ConExpo 2023 earlier this year.
Roy also highlighted the fact that certain customers are interested in the lower levels of noise and vibration that electric machines can offer, rather than just their sustainability credentials.
“It’s not just about emissions. A lot of our customers are really excited about low noise and no vibrations, which can lead to improved operator conditions and also improved safety. We didn’t lead with that but we are finding that it’s just as important and creates new opportunities,” he said.
And he pointed to some unusual examples of where electric machines have proved a success in North America. “We’ve sold compact machines in areas that I would never have thought we’d sell them.
“We laugh about this but the Toronto Zoo needed machines to work at the same time that the buffalos were there but the noise from diesel machines scared them away. We also have an example of a school system that wanted to do some repairs as they are expanding a facility but the work was right next to a classroom and so again the electric machine was more suitable because it was lower noise.”
Roy said that the shift Volvo anticipated taking place in the market meant that competencies among its own workforce also had to change. “We’ve had to go out and search for people that have backgrounds in software and electrical engineering. It’s definitely a new ballgame but it’s a positive in that it’s bringing people into Volvo that maybe wouldn’t have considered it before. Electric and sustainable power brings a whole new generation of people who want to be part of this transformation.”
Meanwhile, Roy, who is set to become president of Volvo-owned Mack Trucks next month, said that machine control technology in construction equipment “continues to get better and more sophisticated”.
He highlighted Volvo’s Dig Assist platform. “We now have a process where you can have an expert operator dig a hole for a certain application. So maybe you were putting in a culvert in a subdivision and you need to dig the hole in the same way. An expert can go out and dig it to the parameters that we need, save the file and transfer it to another excavator. And that excavator operator can now benefit from the best practice of the first, experienced operator.”
And he pointed to the growing capabilities of Volvo’s remote-controlled machines and its productivity tools.
The OEM recently handed over a remote-controlled EC250 excavator to a customer in South Dakota who works installing pipes in a water sewer.
He also noted that Volvo has the capability to retrofit non-Volvo machines and link them into Volvo’s Connected Maps feature, which allows a visual overview in real time of the position and movement of every machine, vehicle and visitor to site.

26 April 2023,Volvo flies in electric machine for Alpine project,"The company delivered jaw-dropping images of the all-electric ECR25 hovering 3,000m above the slopes of the Schilthorn mountain in the Swiss Alps, as it arrived at the summit, to aid the construction of foundations for a new summit station.
According to Volvo, the ECR25 is one of the few compact digging machines able to work at the site’s 2,970m altitude, due to its electric driveline – while the less dense and oxygen-rich air in the mountains causes issues for internal combustion engines, the electric machine operates equally well at high and low altitudes.
Volvo said the obvious advantage of the ECR25 being a zero-emissions machine were also a consideration in its use on the project.
Melchior Burlon, site manager at Ghelma AG Baubetriebe, which is carrying out the work, said, “There are two main problems up on the mountains: on the one hand, we don’t have much space here; and on the other hand, we often encounter problems with diesel engines operating at altitude owing to the thin air and the cold.”
Bulon added, “Volvo CE is the only supplier that offers something of this magnitude. Otherwise, there were only excavators up to two tons and we wanted the most powerful machine for the job – and something that we could still transport via helicopter if necessary.”
Iconic project for electric machine
When completed, the Schilthornbahn project will include the establishment of a cable car route between the village of Stechelberg and the Schilthorn summit.
With an estimated cost of €102 million, the new cableway and iconic summit station – made famous by its use in the James Bond film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service – will enable up to 800 tourists per hour to visit the mountain’s summit.
Timur Abied, utility product manager from Volvo CE, said, “We’re thrilled that the ECR25 Electric has been selected for this project. Not only is it a tricky location, it’s also hugely iconic.
“We’re used to discussing the benefits of near-silent zero emission electric machines in busy urban locations and for indoor works. But this project shows the versatility of electric to solve more problems than one might think.
“We’re very much looking forward to proving the power of electric machines to rise to the toughest of challenges. “"
25 April 2023,Online exclusive: Rokbak investigates electric and hydrogen-powered articulated trucks,"The idea of articulated trucks that can carry a payload of 30 tonnes being powered by electric power might seem far fetched but it is a possibility that the company Rokbak is looking into. Paul Douglas, Managing Director of the articulated truck company – which is part of the Volvo group – says that they are investigating all possibilities.

“Our trucks will have to be zero emissions somehow. The question is: what does that look like?” comments Douglas. “Electrification using battery technology that you can see today is a stretch for these big products because these are big power demand for long hours of usage.”
As Douglas says, electric power probably isn’t the best source for trucks due to how large they are and their work cycles – it isn’t uncommon for trucks to be run for 20 or 22 hours a day. “We are looking at hydrogen internal combustion engine and fuel cells to provide the electricity using hydrogen. These are technologies that Volvo is working with on their own highway truck and bus solutions.”
Douglas is originally an engineer and the challenges of cutting emissions and alternative power sources clearly excites him. He makes the point that, with technology developing at a rapid rate, no one in the construction industry can confidently state what the future will hold for power.
“It is easier to electrify the smaller stuff,” he says. “But there’s a lot of learning that comes from that. And you know, I can’t keep up with battery technology. It’s moving so quickly. Every six months battery capabilities seem to grow almost exponentially. I don’t know where it will all end up, but I think it’ll be a combination; some products will be batteries, some will be hydrogen fuel cells, and some will be hydrogen internal combustion.”
The last 18 months have been a boom time for both rigid and articulated haulers with numbers the highest they have been for around a decade at around 9,000 units a year. Part of this is due to pent up demand that followed the Covid-19 pandemic added to governments around the world investing in large infrastructure projects although Douglas believes that this is likely the peak of the market.
“We all felt at 8,000 units worldwide, that would be the peak. Then we said the same thing at 8,500, but now we are over 9,000 units. When I look around specific markets, we can see the slowdown coming, such as in Europe. I think we’re probably at the peak now. How long will that hold? Most of 2023 will probably level out [at current levels] although we could start to see a downturn in the second half of the year. It’s very strong at the moment, so we need to capitalise on that as much as we can.”
One of the markets that has driven this growth is North America, which Douglas says accounts for over half of Rokbak’s sales. In terms of smaller markets that have seen good growth he highlights Indonesia and the UK where the HS2 high-speed train project has played a key role in generating demand.
The brand of Rokbak has been around now for around 18 months following the name change from Terex Trucks. Douglas says that a huge effort went into this and that the response from the industry has been very positive. “The reception of it has been fantastic, first and foremost with our own dealer network because we were asking them to move from the old name to Rokbak. But they’ve gone with it, they’ve got a positive feel about it, they’ve invested into. The attraction that we’re getting from people that want to be on this journey with this, inquiries about becoming our dealer, has been really good.”
Talking about the dealer network, the change that we spoke about at the start of this article, from diesel powered trucks to alternative powered trucks, will impact dealers in more ways than one. First, they will be selling a different product and secondly there are different demands and opportunities with this.
“Your dealer partners, the people that sell and support the product – this is going to be a new adventure for them as well,” he says. “It’s new technology for them. An electric drive product probably gets less wear parts, less servicing and spares opportunity. That’s going be a real challenge for the traditional dealer. Their business model’s going to have to evolve.”
Equipment manufacturers have reduced emissions to meet different standards around the world and are now investing heavily into the R&D of alternative power sources, all while juggling issues such as rising inflation and a lack of skilled workers. It is a challenge, but Douglas gives off the sense that he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Moving into this new technology, new manufacturing processes are going to be required, new dealer models. There’s a real change, you can feel it in the air,” he says, pausing for breath before adding with a smile, “It’s fascinating.”"
20 April 2023,Volvo CE reports global sales growth of 11% in Q1,"The multinational, headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden, said it was maintaining good profitability on machine sales and benefitting from a favourable product mix, which was more than offsetting slightly lower volumes and the impact of increased material costs.
Volvo’s reported net sales figure was SEK25.1 billion (€2.21 billion), up from SEK22.61 billion (€1.99 billion) in Q1, 2022.
The company’s adjusted operating income was reported as SEK4.59 billion (€404.3 million), corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 18.3%, up from 12.4% in the same period in 2022.
US and European upticks
Volvo also reported growth in its operating margin, thanks largely to continuing strong demand from large infrastructure and construction projects in Europe and in North America.
Compared with the same period in 2022, sales in Europe saw growth of 17% in Q1, while North American sales improved by 37%.
Volvo said this strong growth was able to more than compensate for dips in sales within Asia and South America.
According to the company’s statement, most markets – with the exception of the Chinese market – continue to see good levels of activity, with significant investment being seen in infrastructure and the mining industry.
Market development
In its statement, Volvo CE said it had seen stability in all major markets in the first quarter of the year (with the exception of China, where economic activity was low, and stopped sales in Russia).
The company highlighted North American growth, which it said economic confidence was relatively high and large infrastructure projects were more than offsetting the current weakness in residential construction.
In Europe, Volvo said it believed rental fleet replacements were in part responsible for the growth it had seen in Q1 sales.
South America was highlighted as a weak spot, with sales down due to low business confidence in the largest market of Brazil, while the Asian market, it said, was currently flat.
Looking ahead, Volvo said it was seeing a growing appetite for more sustainable construction equipment in the mid-size range, and as such will continue to with its drive to electrification.
Among the launches already this year was the L120H Electric Conversation wheel loader, fulfilling market appetite for more sustainable solutions in the mid-size range.
Melker Jernberg, president of Volvo CE, said, “Strong profitability and robust sales like the kind we see this quarter is of course important to us and is a testament to the great products and service solutions we continue to bring to the market.
“But these results also allow us to maintain our industry lead in the sustainable transformation, increasing our investments into zero emission solutions and demonstrating innovative partnerships in what is no doubt the biggest technological shift ever to happen in our industry.”"
19 April 2023,Small but mighty: The role of mini and midi excavators in modern projects,"Many manufacturers in the construction industry, certainly the larger ones, have expansive product ranges. One of the reasons for this is financial – the more products a company can sell and service the more money can be made – but another one is simple necessity; construction is such a broad industry that it requires a wide selection of equipment.
Out of all the equipment that is used in construction it is difficult to think of one that has grown in popularity quite as quickly as compact excavators such as the mini excavator (machines approximately 0-6 tonnes) and the midi (approximately 6-10 tonnes).
“The first mini excavators were produced in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a tool of necessity in the country’s famously dense and crowded cities,” explains Chris Sleight, managing director, Off-Highway Research. “By the 1980s they were being exported to Europe and North America, but it was not until the early 1990s when Japanese asset prices collapsed and the economy stagnated that these overseas markets became much more important to the sector’s (still predominantly) Japanese suppliers.”
By the late 1990s, Europe had overtaken Japan as the world’s largest mini excavator market, while demand in North America was matching that of Japan by the mid-2000s. However, it was not until around 15 years ago that the popularity of mini excavators became truly established.
“The previous peak in sales was in 2007, just prior to the impacts of the Lehman Bros. collapse and global economic crisis. That year saw just under 185,000 mini excavators sold worldwide. Fast forward to 2021, the latest peak in the mini excavator cycle, and more than 325,000 units were sold,” says Sleight.
Two key factors have driven this growth: compact excavators have increasingly replaced traditional machine types like the backhoe loader in Europe and North America thanks to the attraction of a smaller footprint, full 360-degree slewing and lower prices than backhoe loaders; they have also started to sell in significant numbers in emerging countries. The most notable has been China, where the mini excavator market peaked at more than 100,000 machines sold in 2020.
Timur Abied, utility product manager at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) tells International Construction that mini and midi excavators are among the OEMs fastest growing product segments with more efficient governance of energy being a main driver.
This sentiment is backed up by Cédric Durand, product management director EMEA, Yanmar Compact Equipment, who says that mini and midi excavators have been growing strongly over the past years.
He adds that, “From one year to another the growth can differ from one country to the other but almost all countries had a strong growth.”
Another smaller factor – but still important – behind the growth in the popularity of these machines is the increased use of attachments such as tiltrotators. “The growing popularity of tiltrotators has been a gamechanger for compact excavators, as tiltrotators allow an excavator operator to tilt and twirl an attachment 360 degrees,” says David Caldwell, national product manager, Takeuchi-US.
New technology is increasingly being integrated into mini and midi excavators, often from what was originally reserved for larger models. Stephane Dieu, excavators product manager, Europe, Develon (previously Doosan), says that, “With the arrival of our DX-7 range, all of the new mini excavators in the range are now equipped with our DoosanConnect telematics system, which was restricted in the past to only our medium and heavy segments – 14 tonne and over in the excavators. This gives our customers the opportunity to fully monitor their compact fleet.”
Chris Bardas, product manager, Hitachi Construction Machinery, reveals that the OEM’s latest mini and compact excavator are, “equipped with ICT solutions, safety features such as rear- and side-view cameras, and benefit from the Zaxis-6 cab, which is renowned for being highly comfortable and spacious, with an ergonomic seat and user-friendly controls.”
Wacker Neuson’s Klaus Allerstorfer, product manager, excavators, agrees that, increasingly, features are being added to mini and midi excavators that in the past were only for bigger models.
“Overall, more and more features are now being integrated into smaller models that were previously only used in larger models,” he explains.
“By features, I don’t just mean hardware, but also digital and data-driven solutions. One example is our EquipCare telematics solution, which makes it easier for our customers to manage their fleets and keep track of the condition of their machines.”
Electric powered equipment is a major trend in construction, especially in compact machines such as mini and midi excavators which many believe are more suited to this type of power than larger machines.
As is the case with many OEMs, Hitachi Construction Machinery has recently launched new electric models in this segment (ZX55U-6EB mini and ZX85-6EB compact) as has Takeuchi, with the all-electric TB20e.
Caterpillar, the world’s largest OEM, announced last year that its construction industries division was working on four new electric equipment machines, including the 301.9 Electric Mini Excavator powered by a Cat 48V, 32kWh battery with a run time of up to eight hours on a single charge.
Another new electric model is Bobcat’s 2-tonne mini-excavator the E19e – an electric version of the E19 internal-combustion model. It offers zero emissions, low-noise operation and comparable levels of performance to its diesel-powered counterpart.
The Bobcat E19e features the same profile and external dimensions. It features a 3.5-hour battery capacity and can be recharged quickly using a super-fast charger, meaning that, by topping up the power during work breaks, the machine can be used all day for the majority of typical applications.
Scott Park, Doosan Bobcat CEO, commented, “With the introduction of the E19e, Bobcat has expanded its larger-size electric line-up of zero emission and quiet machines that can match the excellent performance of our conventional models.”
Volvo CE has been at the centre of the development of electric powered construction equipment, with the OEM introducing its first electric compact models back in 2019 and now offering three compact electric excavators and two compact wheeled loaders. Volvo CE’s Abied says that the company are not just looking at compact equipment though, adding that, “While we started with electric mini excavators, we have also grown into the development of mid-size solutions such as our EC230 Electric excavator.”
While larger excavators may be increasingly electrified in the future, the focus is clearly on compact equipment such as mini and midi excavators.
A key point that OEMs make is that, as well as the benefits of electric power such as no emissions, no noise, no vibrations (thus a more comfortable environment for the operator), one thing is key: performance is just as good, if not better, than with diesel models.
Bardas from Hitachi sums it up by saying, “One of the main advantages of our zero-emission mini and compact excavators, the ZX55U-6EB and ZX85U-6EB, is the high level of performance they provide. No compromises have been made in terms of performance and they have been designed to provide similar levels of performance as diesel alternatives. The fact that they are zero-emission and quieter than diesel models are additional benefits.”
Despite all of the benefits that electric power brings, there are also challenges. Arguably the biggest one is the bottom line. To put it simply, electric machines are considerably more expensive than their diesel counterparts.
“When it comes to battery-powered solutions, the purchase price can be a hurdle,” admits Allerstorfer from Wacker Neuson. “But if you look at the total cost of ownership, the e-machines score with very low maintenance and operating costs, which in turn convinces many customers. In addition, we have found that renting the machines can help to quickly overcome initial doubts.”
Durand from Yanmar agrees that the higher cost is putting off some, but also makes the point that the total cost of ownership over the life of the machine can be less. “Indeed, the purchase cost is still higher than with traditional ICE machines. In the long run this price premium should decrease, and we are looking into the total cost of ownership as well which, at the end, is certainly the best criteria for profitability,” he says.
Another issue is undoubtably with charging and infrastructure. If construction is taking place on a remote site and not in a city then there may not be a power source to charge the battery. At the moment there are no universal standards regarding charging hardware and protocols.
“The lack of charging infrastructure and the still slower pace of introduction is a challenge and we need all stakeholders to help deliver the ecosystem required to support our electric machines and, in doing so, together achieve the strategic objectives of the Paris Agreement,” says Volvo CE’s Abied.
“High energy costs and the lack of financial and legal incentives also hamper deployment of strategic initiatives supporting electric power as the competitive solution for mini and midi excavators.”
When it comes to charging solutions increasing numbers of companies are producing fast charging options and there are other options, such as Wacker Neuson’s ‘charging box’.
“We are not only focusing on the development of zero emission products, but are also looking at entire construction site solutions,” says Allerstorfer.
“We will soon be launching our Charging Box, a mobile power bank for the construction site. This will enable customers to charge their zero emission products easily – and above all independently from local power sources.”
While electric mini and midi excavators are growing in popularity, the number of models sold are very small compared to diesel models. So, what’s next for these diesel models? More new technology being integrated into them that makes the life of an operator easier, and was previously reserved for larger machines, is one trend that will continue.
“These newer technological features all have one thing in common – they’re designed to help operators stay comfortable and more productive,” says Caldwell from Takeuchi US.
“They also help ensure that operators know exactly how their machines are performing by providing a great deal of information at their fingertips.”
In Wacker Neuson’s newest excavator, the wheeled EW100, Allerstorfer says that, “Digitisation played a major role in the development of this machine. For example, we have implemented an intelligent attachment management, a state-of-the-art Human-Machine-Interface, and the preparation for various assistance systems for process optimisation.”
Regarding sales around the world, mini and midi excavators are expected to continue to see strong numbers, if perhaps not at the same levels as in recent years.
Mini excavators are machines which replace manual labour. With the economic driver of rising labour costs (plus the difficulty in finding workers ) added to the fact that the purchase cost for these machines is cheaper than ever, adoption will continue.
“Drivers like these are at play in emerging markets, and the large-scale mini excavator industry which has sprung up in China means that machines are more affordable now than they were before,” says Off Highway Research’s Sleight. “This will help drive the adoption of this type of compact equipment around the world in the years to come.”
It will be interesting to see just what technology and power sources these mini and midi excavators of the future are equipped with as standard."
17 April 2023,IRE 2023: what equipment will be on show?,"Since the last edition of the International Rental Exhibition (IRE), it would be an understatement to say that plenty of innovation has taken place among manufacturers, driven by the demand for compact equipment, alternative power and environmentally friendly solutions.
The show will bring an array of those OEMs together under one roof to display just some of the latest launches and developments in construction equipment and technology, as well as aerial platforms through the APEX show, which is being held in conjunction with IRE.
With a wide range of equipment on show - more than 200 companies combined are exhibiting at IRE and APEX - here is a preview of what visitors can expect to see at IRE 2023.
The role of sustainability and low-emission equipment has continued to increase in recent years, and that theme will be highlighted at IRE as Sany will show the electrically driven SY19E mini excavator.
The machine, which the company says delivers zero pollutant emissions and significantly lower noise levels, comes with an electric motor that delivers a peak output of 15kW and an accumulator pack that lasts for an entire working day on one battery charge.
Charging the machine is made possible with a fast-charging station via DC in 1.5 hours, at a public AC charging station in 2.5 hours or overnight at a 220V socket.
Case Construction will highlight its CX15 EV 1.3 tonne mini excavator. Powered by a 16kW electric motor, the machine features retractable tracks that reduces machine width to 790mm and a load-sensing hydraulic system that is said to allow the operator to dial the machine into each task.
The 21.5kWh lithium-ion battery is charged either by the 110V/220V on-board charger or via an external rapid charger that can fully charge the machine in 90 minutes and can last up to an entire working day depending on the work, while its minimum swing radius design is said to make working close to structures and obstacles easier.
From its range of electric and low-emission machines, Yanmar will display several future-ready machines at IRE.
First up is the SV17e electric mini excavator prototype. Designed for the 1.5 to 2.0 tonnes segment, the unit is powered by an all-electric drive and has an open-centre hydraulic system with load-sensing hydraulic pump.
The SV17e delivers 23.5kWh gross electric power, while its 48V air-cooled motors provides “impressive digging, lifting and carrying capabilities,” according to Yanmar.
Another Yanmar prototype on show will be the V8e electric compact wheel loader with 40kWh battery capacity, hydrostatic drive and high-lifting capabilities.
The machine has an 800l loading bucket, 11kW charging in standard configuration and 22kW in optional fast charging.
Joining the SV17e and V8e is the C08e tracked carrier and ViO33 zero tail swing excavator.
With an 11.5kWh battery and a power capacity of 24V, Yanmar says the compact C08e has the “ultimate power and manoeuvrability to excel in tight spaces,” while the ViO33 is said to offer “true zero tail swing” and an “ultra-quiet and efficient engine” designed with low emissions in mind.
Launched in 2020, the eDingo 500 electric compact utility loader from Toro will make its European tradeshow debut at IRE having undergone several upgrades over the last three year’s.
An electric version of the Dingo 323, the machine produces zero engine-exhaust emissions and less noise thanks to its HyperCell Power System, a new lithium-ion battery system developed by Toro.
On its stand, Tobrocco Giant will show its latest line of electric loaders with the G2700E X-TRA, which is an electrically driven version of the powerful G2700 diesel series, and the G2200E X-TRA.
Both loaders are equipped with an 48V LPT-battery and have a pulling force of 12.500N. Optionally the battery can be charged at a car charging station. Said to be ideal for rental, the machine is described by the company as compact and easyily transportable.
Elsewhere on its stand, the company will show its GP1950E electric vibratory plate and the GR740E vibratory rammer.
JCB will show its latest innovations in zero-emissions technology and demonstrate its role in the move towards a cleaner, low-emission future for construction and rental equipment with its growing range of JCB E-TECH electric machinery.
The JCB 19C-1E - the world’s first electric mini excavator will take centre stage, the company say.
The machine is said to produce zero exhaust emissions at point of use and is “considerably quieter” than a standard machine.
Four lithium-ion batteries provide 20kWh of energy storage – enough for full working shift for many mini excavator customers on a single charge.
Also new will be a 2 tonne capacity E2000 electric site dumper from HG Machines in Denmark. This machine follows on from the ultra-compact 1 tonne capacity machines launched by the company in 2016. See more on this machine here.
The newly launched Archy rental platform from Gorman-Rupp Europe will be officially launched into the international market at IRE.
The platform aims to deliver “faster, easier and more reliable” pump rental by using a 10-step pump selector that can advise which pump is needed for specific projects.
It then suggests which pump will be ideal for the user and details how to reserve, rent and manage the pumps as well as all the rental pricing.
Gorman-Rupp say 100s of pumps will be available on the tool, including booster pumps, centrifugal pumps, diaphragm pumps, high pressure centrifugal pumps, pump hoses and submersible pumps.
Another new launch on show at IRE will be the Task Manager web application from Volvo CE. The worksite management tool, which is currently available in the North American market, is designed to connect people, machines and projects to ensure activities are delivered “on target, on time and to budget,” according to Volvo CE.
Swepac will show a line-up of reversible plates it is launching as part of its Battery One concept range.
The FB200B has a 4.6kWh onboard battery, 3.0kW IPM synchronous motor, 550mm wide base plate, while the larger FB300B has a 6.6kWh onboard battery, 10.0kW IPM synchronous motor and 600mm wide base plate.
The large onboard batteries enable them to reach sufficient running time without re-charging.
Users can monitor the progress of projects, set targets, track material on sites and manage data from mixed fleets in real-time. The data collected by Task Manager is then made accessible via mobile or laptop.
Spartan Solutions will debut its PHALANX V6 software platform that aims to streamline the process of equipment rental operations.
The platform utilises artificial intelligence (AI), expert rules and statistical algorithms to identify patterns and trends in equipment’s telematics and operations data. This data includes information about the performance, operation, maintenance, and usage of a machine.
Once the data is collected, the AI engine can detect any abnormalities or issues.
Launched at Bauma 2022, the HBOX+ Hybrid lighting tower will be presented by Himoinsa.
The tower combines a battery-powered system and Stage V diesel engine that is said to reduce noise and carbon footprint while keeping the 120,000-lumen light capacity of its diesel counterpart.
The HBOX+ Hybrid includes LFP batteries (Lithium Phosphate) that have been designed for a lifetime of 6000 cycles, while also offering four different working modes.
The HBOX+ Hybrid incorporates 4 x 350W LED spotlights and an LED Dimming Control which means the tower can start-up with dimming.
Himoinsa will also demonstrate the 45/60 model (60kW/h) of its EHR battery-powered generator which comes with its HICORE System.
Described as a compact, clean product, the generator can operate as a single source of power generation for as a recharging station for electrical construction machinery, as well as allowing integration with gas and diesel generator sets.
Vistors to the Briggs & Stratton stand will be able to see its newest Vanguard battery products and engine solutions.
The products on display include the Vanguard Si 1.5kWh Swappable Battery and the new Vanguard 400 EFI /ETC Single Cylinder (pictured).
The company says it developed the cylinder by working with OEMs to provide a “tailored power solution, that caters to each OEM’s specific requirements within the rental market.”
Generac Mobile will display the VT-Solar, a generator-free lighting tower with three solar panels that can recharge its built-in battery pack.
The tower is available in two versions, a manual-mast and hydraulic-mast version, which comes with higher battery capacity, powerful solar panels (400W each) and four LED floodlights with adjustable light power.
Exhibiting alongside Generac Mobile, Pramac will display its GRW Hybrid generator, which it describes as an efficient, reliable unit that reduces operational expenditure, with a choice of available operating modes that allow the correct selection according to site specifications.
Trime will present the X-SOLAR 4x60W LED lighting tower fitted with four 60W LED lamps.
The company says it is built to be robust, with galvanised metal works, and powder coating finish.
The zero-emission tower also has optional features, including a telemetry system for remote location and operational monitoring, an automatic start-up PIR operation, and dimmable lighting.
Elsehwere, ItalTower will exhibit its Street Solar lighting tower that it launched last year.
The tower with a 60W solar panel produces 6,000 lumens and has a lithium battery pack with a capacity of 14.8V.
Paclite will display its concept edging trowel, the M600.
Powered by a Vanguard engine, the new concept 600mm machine has been developed together with Cramo Sweden and is said to be ideal for rental due to its ABS fly wheel, which ensures concrete does not stick to the trowel.
Paclite says it will launch new versions of the M900 and M600 later this year, powered by a long-lasting battery-charger & motor.
Taking place from 6-8 June, IRE will be held at the MECC centre in Maastricht, the Netherlands, alongside APEX, the European Rental Association’s (ERA) annual Convention and the European Rental Awards.

06 April 2023,Construction waste reduction: squaring the circle,"The transition towards a circular economy is a global challenge. Due to the rising consumption and extreme pressure on resources, society faces a growing scarcity of essential resources and a great burden on the environment.
When looking at the environmental impact of the construction sector, it is noted that it is responsible for more than 37% of the EU’s total waste generation (Eurostat, 2021), making it one of the biggest waste streams in Europe.
Therefore, it is one of the sectors where transformation towards circular solutions can have a high impact on society and reducing the pressure on our planet.
Green Deal goals
Policy makers at the EU level have been working on achieving the concept of a circular economy. The current EU Green Deal objective is to transform different industries to reduce waste generation, foster recycling and make circular products the norm in the EU.
Among the various economic sectors that are expected to contribute to this circular journey, the construction sector is one of the most promising.
The EU is addressing the environmental footprint of the construction sector mainly through the Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) which sets the basic concepts and definitions for construction and demolition waste (CDW) management and prescribes Member States with CDW recovery targets.
Eurostat data for the management of the mineral fraction of CDW in 2018 show that recycling is the predominant management form in most of the EU countries.
The East-West divide
When looking at the regional differences, Southeast Europe (SEE) countries such as Bulgaria, Slovakia, Romania or Croatia are lagging behind Western countries in terms of material recovery and recycling practices.
In fact, Eurostat data show that, for instance, in Bulgaria 24% of the mineral CDW is subject to recycling, the rest (76%) is usually landfilled.
In many areas some types of waste in landfill sites could cause health and environmental risks to the residents.
Such low numbers of construction waste recycling can be explained by building practices in the past, which makes the traceability of products and materials in buildings extremely challenging.
This situation shows the importance of deploying innovative solutions for CDW management that, through the development of economically viable and scalable models, can accelerate the transition towards the circular construction in the SEE region.
This is particularly the case for sectors such as roads (reconstruction and rehabilitation activities), domestic construction (building demolition) and industrial enterprises (reconstruction and demolition) which are considered the biggest generators of waste in the region.
In order to increase the availability of reused and recycled construction products across Europe, FIEC decided to participate in MOBICCON-PRO project, funded under EU Horizon Europe programme. Its overall objective is to develop, introduce and demonstrate integrated innovative circular solutions to recover resources from construction and demolition waste.
The project coordinator Glavbolgarstroy Holding AD (GBS), that is the largest construction corporate group in Bulgaria, aims to intensify CDW circularity to contribute to a full transition to a circular economy in the SEE region, in line with the Green Deal targets.
During the kick-off meeting of the project in Sofia back in January Executive Director of Glavbolgarstroy Holding AD Mrs Albena Angelova stressed the importance of the project to the region and its ambitious goals.
MOBICCON-PRO project is composed of ten partners from five European countries (Bulgaria, France, Belgium, Denmark, France, and Serbia) hopes to achieve numerous objectives over five years period, including:
It is important to note that MOBICCON-PRO has the ambition to combine physical solutions adapted to the ground (a mobile plant) with state-of-the-art digital technologies and the active participation of industry, academia, and civil society to offer a systemic solution for CDW management.
The long-term ambition is that the results are replicated not only in Bulgaria, but also in the region.

31 March 2023,Next-gen Rokbak haulers in development,"Rokbak has announced that it is developing its next generation of operator cabs for its articulated haulers.
Revealed as part of its presence at ConExpo 2023, the company said that new cabs for the RA30 and RA40 haulers would include features that provide vehicle drivers with more comfort.
They will also have an updated ergonomic layout and screen displays that enable easier operation and ensure that the models are ready for future automation and connectivity functionalities.
While the company has not revealed a launch date for the next-generation haulers, its current models took centre stage at the company’s ConExpo stand, which focused on the four key themes of innovation, sustainability, connected services and efficiencies.
According to the manufacturer, which is part of the Volvo Group, these themes are what “will continue to shape the company’s development journey and have been created from customer feedback, market research, technology advancements and product performance improvements”.
Rokbak’s Senior Product Manager, Scott Pollock, said, “We’re always innovating, designing and building to keep our haulers rock solid. Since the success of our rebrand 18 months ago, we are now moving into the next phase of the Rokbak development journey. Our four product themes will be used to develop both Rokbak’s future product and product services offerings, aligned to customer needs.”
In line with Volvo’s group sustainability targets, both the RA30 and RA40 feature fuel-efficient drivetrains and are compatible with HVO fuel (hydrotreated vegetable oil), which significantly reduces CO2 emissions.
“Rokbak haulers deliver new benchmarks in both performance and total cost of ownership, and reinforce the company’s commitment to sustainability and journey to net-zero as part of the Volvo Group,” said Pollock, adding that “Customer needs will continue to guide our product strategy and we will continue to invest in our Rokbak products and services.”

27 March 2023,Paving the way forward: what’s new in road construction?,"There is no doubt that roads are among the most important pieces of infrastructure in the world. To keep up with the billions of people using one of the world’s oldest industrial advancements to commute to work or cross national borders, the equipment and technology used to build roads must be able to meet the demand.
Construction Intelligence Centre (CIC) is currently tracking road-related construction projects in Europe with a total value of €448 billion – €182.8 billion is said to be in the execution stage and €152.5 billion is in the planning stage. Russia accounts for the highest value with €61 billion, followed by the UK with projects valuing €59.8 billion.
Balfour Beatty recently announced that they have been awarded a huge roadbuilding contract within the UK’s Lower Thames Crossing project.
The deal, worth approximately €1.37 billion, will see the company construct more than 16km of roads to the north of the proposed river crossing, including a crucial connection with the M25 motorway that runs around London.
The scope of the contract, awarded by the UK’s National Highways agency, also includes the construction of 49 structures, including bridges and viaducts, many of which will be built offsite, using modular construction techniques.
Over in Norway, several major roadbuilding projects are nearing completion. The Trysfjord Bridge has been a ground-breaking engineering project that has seen the boundaries of digital engineering pushed to their limits.
Consultants Norconsult says that through close collaboration between contractors and advisers, they have been able to reduce the concrete footprint by over 18% from previous solutions for the crossing.
The Trysfjord Bridge is said to stretch the limits of what is possible to build as a free-forward bridge, with its fjord span of 260 metres, especially since the bridge is being built with four carriageways and a total width of 24 metres.
With an increase in projects across the continent, companies are looking for ways to improve efficiency and get more done with the same amount of time and workers – so could attachments be a solution to this problem?
Lynn Marsh, president of Roadwidener, believes that they can. “Attachments provide a realistic, effective solution by utilising equipment that contractors are already familiar with. By changing workflow, minimising maintenance, lowering equipment cost, allowing for smarter labour and increasing Return on Investment [ROI]”.
Road construction tasks like backfilling and aggregate placement are typically considered four-step processes. Marsh thinks that the way to increase efficiency and safety is to minimise the number of steps in the process with the use of material placement attachments.
She adds, “Crews can do more work in a day and do more with their budget by cutting out steps without adding more self-propelled machines or workers. And those savings continue with a drastically lower cost of ownership when compared to self-propelled machines.”
Attachments are just one solution to the growing demand for road infrastructure projects. OEMs are also ensuring that they can simplify the process with advances in electric equipment.
Set to debut at North America’s largest construction trade show ConExpo-Con/Agg 2023, Volvo Construction Equipment’s (Volvo CE) DD25 Electric asphalt compactor is the company’s first electric machine produced specifically for the company’s road segment.
Volvo CE designed the compact double-drum compactor for small-scale compaction projects including street repairs and patching, parking lots, driveways, municipalities and rental houses.
Dr Ray Gallant, vice president of Product Management and Productivity at Region Americas, Volvo CE, said that after the DD25 Electric’s introduction at ConExpo, the company expects to take orders for the compactor later in 2023, with deliveries in the first quarter of 2024.
The machine will initially be available in North America, with other markets hoping to follow later.
Like Volvo CE, Wirtgen Group-owned Hamm has introduced the HX series, with the company calling it a new generation of pivot-steered tandem rollers.
Replacing the previous DV+ series, Hamm says it has an intuitive operation with Easy Drive, high-performance data, comfort features and sustainable operation, as well as the ‘Smart Compact’ digital compaction assistant. All models are available in countries with the EPA Tier 4/EU Stage V emissions regulation.
A foundation for high compaction quality is intelligent drive control with automatic reversing. Hamm says that this, in combination with the electrically adjustable seat operating unit, “guarantees quality and comfort.”
The seat turns automatically in the direction of travel when reversing, which is said to be unique in the market.
The Smart Compact compaction assistant can be used in the rollers of the HX series. The system decides compaction automatically and individually for each drum: whether to compact with vibration and big or small amplitude, with oscillation, or statically. The driver only has to enter whether a base, binder or asphalt surface course is to be compacted.
Hamm says that it is the first manufacturer in the world to automate the separate setting of both drums and is raising the compaction and surface process reliability and quality.
Equipment manufacturers are adapting their technology at great speed but also integral to any road project is the asphalt mixing plant.
Poland-based company Trakt has played a key role in the country’s roadbuilding projects. The company recently purchased an Ammann ABA 210 UniBatch Asphalt-Mixing Plant to ensure that they can take on any task.
Established in 1991, Trakt has built a solid reputation among road companies in Poland’s northeast region. It specialises in the construction and modernisation of roads, streets, bridges, sewage systems and engineering structures – and above all in the production of varied bituminous mixes.
“We were involved in the construction of access roads to our region,” says Jerzy Szklaruk, President of Trakt. “There were lots of municipal roads, which required us to produce between three and five different types of mixes every day.”
The company says that adjusting between the mix types was not a problem due to the benefits given to them by the Ammann ABA UnitBatch.
A key driver behind purchasing a new plant was its 210 tonnes per hour capacity. The previous plants produced a mix of 80 tonnes per hour – which was typically enough for Trakt’s projects.
“But there are days or recipes where you need to accelerate to 210 tonnes per hour, and thanks to the ABA UniBatch we are prepared for it,” Szklaruk added. “With large contracts, the performance of the plant translates into a real margin for the entire project. In three days, we can accomplish what takes others a week.”
Trakt purchased its ABA 210 UniBatch with a cold recycling system and a BKS coal dust burner. It has plans to add asphalt foaming capability as well.
“We equipped the plant with recycling components, but only with the future in mind. Relatively little RAP is used in our region. But whenever there is a project using RAP, we are more competitive.”
While the RAP usage may be low, that is already changing – and the percentage will continue to grow, says Szklaruk.
In the meantime, the company says that being as sustainable as it can is a priority. Ammann’s filtration system coupled with
the plant’s ability to suppress sound via ribbed sheets in the discharge channels to reduce sound is said to be in line with the company’s wider environmental goals.
Sustainability is something we are talking about more and more frequently, so it comes as no surprise that the roadbuilding equipment industry is working diligently to meet our environmental targets.
Many companies are currently working towards increasing efficiencies throughout projects whilst ensuring the equipment is as sustainable as it can be. This year will see even more roadbuilding projects – some even more ambitious than before – and a continued ease of movement across the continent.
US-based contractor Fluor and its Dutch joint venture (JV) partner Ballast Nedam have been awarded a contract to design, build and maintain a major section of the A27 motorway in the Netherlands.
Fluor’s share of the contract will total approximately €414 million.
The JV team will widen approximately 40km of the existing motorway and extend it to form a future connection to the proposed Groote Haar business park in Gorinchem.
Within the scope of the contract, the team will also replace two motorway bridges and carry out repairs to the Hooipolder junction.
The contract, awarded by the Netherlands’ Ministry for Public Works and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat), has a two-phase approach, with the project owners preparing the detailed design of the second phase, once the first phase of construction is underway.
Rijkswaterstaat and its development partner ALSÉÉN anticipate this leading to a more refined scope of work and a more predictable second phase for the project, as it will allow for more accurate site investigations and work packaging, plus more clarity in subcontract negotiations.
Shawn West, president of Fluor’s Infrastructure business, said, “Fluor has more than 20 years of experience designing, building and maintaining sustainable infrastructure projects in the Netherlands.
“This is the first project in the region to use a new two-phase approach between the joint venture and Rijkswaterstaat to limit project risks. We expect this unique approach to result in better project outcomes and a more stable execution phase for all parties.”
Construction on the motorway is scheduled to begin later this year, with completion expected between 2029 and 2031.
Trimble has announced that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) Operations and Maintenance has selected its AgileAssets infrastructure enterprise asset management software to manage, maintain and operate the country’s 10,600-km road network and associated transportation infrastructure.
The NPRA is reported to already be using Trimble’s Quadri software, a cloud-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) collaboration solution that is used for construction projects.
Additionally, the NPRA believes that Trimble’s Quadri and AgileAssets will enable them to meet growing demands by leveraging connected data to improve performance throughout the entire asset lifecycle, from design and construction to operations and maintenance.
“Delivering safe, cost-effective and sustainable transportation infrastructure increasingly depends on closing the data gap between construction, maintenance and operations,” said Shelly Nooner, vice president of Innovation and Platform in Trimble’s Owner and Public Sector.
“Today, design data is as important during maintenance as it is during construction. As infrastructure needs increase in size and complexity, and data continues to accumulate through an asset’s lifecycle, the ability to share, analyse and build on that data at every stage will be transformative.”"
27 March 2023,Volvo CE appoints new head of operations,"Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has appointed Kamel Sid as its head of operations.
Sid previously held the role on an acting basis, having replaced former head of operations Jean Marc des Courieres who retired in 2022.
He has been with the company since 2012, in which time he has served as vice president of operations, vice president of operations for loaders, trucks, road machinery and components and vice president of industrial strategy and global supply chain.
In a career that has spanned more than 22 years, Sid has also held roles at Renault Trucks, Meritor and Faurecia.
According to Volvo CE, the new role will see Sid assume responsibility for the smooth running, efficiency, quality and output of its global operations.
Sid said, “I am thrilled to continue working with our many passionate and committed colleagues in Operations and together drive our transformation agenda.”
Melker Jernberg, president of Volvo CE, adds: “After six months as acting Head of Operations I am delighted that Kamel has agreed to join the Executive Management Team as a permanent member.
“He has wide experience both inside and outside the Volvo Group and will play an important role in taking our operations organization to the next level at this time of transformation and change in our business.”"
27 March 2023,Achieving peak efficiency in diesel technology,"Most construction companies are now looking at how they can reduce their CO2 footprints. There are a variety of routes to achieving that goal, with solutions tailored to a given business function. Across the front office, a culture of reduced energy usage can help cut power consumption. On work sites, switching over to equipment that uses low-CO2 energy can reduce harmful emissions and, often, cut noise pollution.

With the advent of market-ready electrified powertrains, gas-fuelled internal combustion and even fuel cell electric drives, where does the push for CO2 reductions leave diesel power? With the intense media focus on new tech, you might think that diesel engines will soon be appearing at a museum near you, where visitors can marvel at the historic technology that once supported the global construction industry.
While switching over to machines that use new power is good for public relations and the atmosphere, it comes at a price. Considerable capital investment is required to replace older machines with those using electric and gas fuel power. Such a move can also necessitate a change in work practises regarding operation and fuelling, possibly resulting in lost machine uptime and still more spend.
None of this is very appealing to companies already operating in a higher cost, lower margin environment. So, what’s the alternative? Well, while we were looking at bigger and better battery packs, diesel technology has made real improvements. With cleaner combustion cycles, the introduction of low-carbon fuels and advanced emissions treatment hardware, diesel has never been cleaner. So clean are the latest on-highway diesel engines that proposed Euro 7 standards have truck manufacturers focusing on reducing brake dust and tyre particulates rather than engine emissions.
Perkins Engines has produced about 22 million diesel engines since it was founded in 1932. From its first factory, located in Peterborough, UK, the company has expanded to a network of manufacturing locations in various countries around the world, including the US, China, Brazil and India.
The manufacturer offers a wide range of industrial engine sizes; manufacturing is generally split between small and medium (0.5 to 7.1 litres) and large engines (7.2 to 18 litres). Around the world, a Perkins engine comes off a production line every 15 seconds.
At this year’s Bauma Munich, Perkins introduced its first battery packs for use in heavy machinery. But while today’s market requires OEMs to offer a full range of power solutions, the company remains a leading provider of diesel engines and developer of technologies intended to improve diesel engine performance.
Having been with Perkins for more than 20 years, Paul Muller, technical sales manager, is well placed to respond when asked about the benefits of modern diesel engines.
“Diesel is incredibly energy dense,” he explains. “It’s a very good way of moving energy from A to B. Batteries can be a challenge when it comes to getting the same energy density onto machines. The packs have to be able to do a day’s work, or there needs to be the recharging infrastructure.
“There are a number of applications which will be more difficult to move to alternative power sources; that doesn’t mean we won’t be able to do that in the future, but there are still some important applications where diesel just makes sense.”
Smaller, lighter machines are ideal for a swap to electric power, but Muller says that in cases where infrastructure is not available – particularly where infrastructure creation is the project at hand – it’s necessary to bring energy to that location and diesel has, and will continue to be, a great way to get energy to where it is needed.
“Compression ignition combustion engines are a pretty efficient way of turning one form of energy into another one. You can run lower-carbon fuels, hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVOs), synthetic diesels with increased levels of biofuel to reduce the carbon impact. But today’s diesel engines, particularly when looking at NOx and particulates, are incredibly clean compared to where they were.”
Muller puts forward that, since regulations were first put in place, the emissions levels of these pollutants from diesel engines has been cut by about 95%.
That’s not to say that Perkins is ignoring other solutions; the company is continuing to investigate power technologies as they emerge. Muller states that picking one over another is not beneficial, but all tech solutions can and will be made more efficient over time.
“We’re continuing to improve all our solutions at the same time, looking at the machines and the applications where they’re being used. Running up to 20% biofuel is acceptable with our current range of engines and we’ve found that running on synthetic diesel or HVO can make a big difference if they’re available. But the message about diesel engines is that if you’re concerned about your carbon, you can do something about it now.”
Another major manufacturer of engines for the off-highway market is Cummins.
Steve Nendick, marketing communications director for Global and European Off-Highway, Cummins, says that diesel engines will remain the default choice for the majority of machines due to its flexibility, coupled with the lack of infrastructure to support electricity delivery and hydrogen suppliers.
“A Cummins B6.7 can power machinery across a wide power band of 150 to 320hp,” he says. “A [machine] manufacturer can adapt a common, cost-effective installation across a range of power needs. For alternative power, due to the cost and size/space impact of the technology, it needs to be specific to exactly meet the duty cycle of the machine.”
He adds that the Cummins Performance Series range of Stage 5-compliant engines can already satisfy the duty cycles of various construction machinery demands, while generating near zero NOx and particulate emissions.
Engine downsizing is important to supporting those reductions. “The Performance Series can replace engines of higher displacement without impacting productivity,” adds Nendick. “It delivers a lower-cost installation and more efficient operation, with less fuel and lower CO2 emissions. Servicing costs are also reduced, with less oil and filters needed.”
Volvo Penta has introduced a series of machines using electric and gaseous fuel power, but the company
remains a major manufacturer of diesel engines. As stated in its marketing material, low weight, low fuel consumption and dependable power still makes diesel ideally suited for numerous machine and equipment applications.
Morgan Blomgren, director of strategy and business development, Volvo Penta, says that the ubiquity of diesel across industrial applications has generated the need for improved efficiency and performance. But limited availability of ‘new’ fuel types and related infrastructure are also continuing to support compression combustion.
“The availability of diesel fuel is still, to an extent, the primary attraction; but some substantial legacy investments across certain industries and businesses could make it challenging to simply change out of existing systems,” he points out.
This is reflected in the number of ‘new power’ machines appearing on work sites. “So far, the shift to alternative fuel and electric power in the construction segment has been limited,” says Blomgren. “However, there are signs in markets like China, for example, that it’s picking up. So likely we’ll see a bigger change in coming years.”
Volvo Penta has pledged to achieve net-zero value chain emissions by 2040. Blomgren puts forward that this will be supported by wider changes in the construction sector. “Our electric drivelines for construction applications meet with stricter emissions and noise regulations in urbanised settings.”
In December 2022, China’s Weichai Group announced that it had achieved a brake thermal efficiency (BTE) rating of 52.28% for a commercial diesel engine. The findings were certified by the testing authority TÜV Nord. This was not the first record of its type for the company; in September 2020 Weichai revealed it had achieved a BTE rating of 50.23% and in January 2022, a figure of 51.09% was reached.
“There are a series of routes to reaching this efficiency level,” says Muller. “At Perkins, we’re looking at different oils to help reduce friction. Achieving a favourable balance between protection and lubrication is critical and diesel engine oils have advanced as the engines have been developed. We also look at the ring packs, and combustion, using advanced computational fluid dynamics to determine the most effective spray [injection] patterns and getting maximum energy out of minimum fuel.”
Beyond improvements across the engine, he notes that working with customers on integration projects helps to lift efficiency. Elements such as machine warm up to help reduce friction and improve fuel economy at start-up. The company is also revisiting hybridisation, together with the electrification of peripheral components to reduce load on the engine. “We’ve seen applications move from an engine-driven fan to an electrically-driven fan. We were still using the engine to produce the electricity, but the efficiency gains were really good,” says Muller.
Siobhan Scott, marketing manager at Perkins, adds that it will be investigation of separate areas across the engine that will deliver better efficiency. “There’s no one thing in a diesel engine which will change dramatically, deliver a big step change. It’s a case of looking at specific areas and together those individual wins will add up to big improvements.”
“We’re looking at ways to make every drop of diesel fuel count,” says Muller. “We think that diesel will be around for a while yet, so we’ll look to drive that efficiency up and up.”
According to Muller, increased engine displacement does not return a proportional increase in emissions, with the exception of those engines produced for applications not required to meet specific targets. That said, he advises that the products that Perkins manufactures fall within the most regulated band of engines. “Regulations per kilowatt of a 500kW engine are the same as a 60kW engine.”
While displacement is not directly related to emissions, engine output is far more critical. “Over the years, we’ve pushed engine downsizing to increase power density,” he says. “Where a large engine will produce higher emissions is when you’re using too big of an engine for the application. We work with customers to really understand their application, studying the data to help them choose the right engine size and power. A right-sized engine running near the top of its capabilities will be a cleaner engine – a happier engine.”
Essentially, speed and load factor are critical to engine efficiency and reduced emissions. In these instances, an engine will be operating at the right temperatures, while coolant will have the correct flow rates. All of which adds up to an engine operating in its sweet spot.
“We used to see that a lot, an application where an 18-litre engine was used to deliver 100kW of power. We’ve had projects where we downsized from 13- to 7-litre engines. The turbochargers we use with our 4.4- and 7.1-litre engines, those have allowed us to replace larger, inefficient models with a version which is much more power dense and they end up being much cleaner.”
Torque delivery can also play a part in engine selection. The torque output curves of on- and off-highway engines can be dramatically different. Muller says that this is where an on-highway engine adapted for off-highway use can struggle. But as an off-highway engine specialist, the air, fuel and combustion systems used on Perkins engines help to deliver the required torque, while also reducing related emissions.
Together with optimised engine selection, cutting emissions is a case of continuous technology improvement. “We’ve made some incredible advances, but we’ll continue to push and find ways to reduce [diesel] emissions,” says Muller. “We’ll try and make the engines more efficient so they use less fuel and we’ll make them run on as many fuels as possible. The goal is to optimise, while we continue on the journey to reduce carbon.”

Powered by an industrial hydrogen engine pioneered by Kubota Corporation, Denyo has started the development of a hydrogen-fuelled generator.
As part of the company’s initiatives to produce carbon neutrality in its engines, Kubota has been researching engines for industrial machines that have greater fuel efficiency and which are able to use carbon-free fuels such as hydrogen, bio and synthetic.
The Kubota 3.8 L industrial off-highway hydrogen engine eliminates carbon dioxide emissions by using hydrogen.
The development is making progress within the high-volume sector of portable generators by Denyo by using a 45kVA diesel generator as a base and aims to release a dedicated hydrogen-fueled generator into the market early.
A fuel-cell portable generator produces electric energy through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. A hydrogen mixed combustion generator uses technologies to limit carbon dioxide emissions through the combustion of hydrogen in combination with other fuels, such as diesel and city gas."
19 March 2023,ConExpo-Con/Agg draws record visitors,"AEM has hailed a successful ConExpo-Con/Agg and IFPE with a record breaking 139,000 visitors to the Las Vegas show. The exhibition closed on Saturday afternoon, March 18.
Attendees from 133 countries were able to see more than 2,400 exhibitors, covering 3 million square feet of exhibit space, which was 10.5% up on 2020.
Visitor numbers were 6% higher than the pandemic-impacted 2020 event - which closed a day early - and more than 24,000 travelled from outside the USA, representing 17% of the total.
“The innovations in the construction industry unveiled this week will play a role in helping construction professionals drive meaningful and sustainable economic growth,” said Phil Kelliher, Caterpillar senior vice president and ConExpo-Con/Agg show chair.
“Live events in the construction industry are very important, because you can see, touch and experience the products. That value was reaffirmed this past week across the show floor.”
Apart from the positive attendance numbers, the show saw an increased focus on sustainable technologies and products, from battery powered compact machines to hydrogen engines and electric powertrains. Connected technology – taking the next step beyond telematics – was also a big feature of the event.

The next ConExpo-Con/Agg and IFPE will be on March 3-7, 2026, at the same Las Vegas venue."
15 March 2023,"Volvo Penta, Gradall team on e-excavator concept","Gradall has unveiled an electrified concept model of its multipurpose, highway speed XL 4100 V wheeled excavator, powered by Volvo Penta’s electric driveline, at ConExpo. The zero-emissions concept EL41H4, is on display at the Gradall booth (W41500). The development exemplifies evolution of the two companies’ long-standing partnership, as well as Volvo Penta’s ability to act as a full system supplier of the electromobility technology.
The concept machine is powered entirely by two Volvo Penta batteries, matched to the duty cycle of the excavator, which fit neatly into the existing engine bay. The electric driveline system from Volvo Penta also includes the complete high voltage system — electric motors, gearboxes, inverters, junction boxes and cabling.
“We were looking for a major power solutions provider with a good track record to partner with,” said Mike Popovich, president of Gradall. “We see Volvo Penta as a power partner rather than an engine supplier – this is a turnkey solution to them. We didn’t want to be in a situation where we’re mixing and matching from 10 different suppliers and trying to make it all work seamlessly. Volvo Penta’s full systems approach and expertise, together with proven Volvo Group technology, was the ideal solution for us. This is a natural progression of our existing partnership towards where we’re both heading in the future.”
The partnership between Volvo Penta and Gradall began in 2014 when Volvo Penta became the exclusive supplier of 5 and 8 L Tier 4 final engines for Gradall’s diesel-powered telescopic boom excavators.
With growing interest from Gradall’s municipality customers for quieter, cleaner solutions that meet intensifying sustainability demands and regulations, collaborative discussions between Gradall and Volvo Penta began in spring 2022.
“Expanding our partnership with Gradall into electromobility is an exciting development for us,” says Hannes Norrgren, president of Volvo Penta’s Industrial Business Unit. “This is our first electrification project in a construction application, representing another milestone in Volvo Penta’s electromobility journey and aligning with our sustainability ambitions.”
Unlike a traditional hydraulic excavator, Gradall’s highway speed solution icorporates a telescopic boom mounted next to a separate cab sitting to the rear of a road-going chassis that allows the machine to be independently dispatched to many locations throughout the workday, rather than requiring a low loader for transport.
With a hydraulic system powered by a Volvo Penta-supplied electric machine power take-off (EM PTO), this concept machine can use battery power to transport its own excavator. The system will deliver 94 kWh of energy, and with the increased likelihood of the EL41H4 operator returning to the yard between jobs or for lunch, the potential is high for opportunity charging, or reaching full capacity in under 45 minutes from a 150 kW charger.
The highway speed design – and its suitability for work in environments where knuckle boom models may not be the ideal fit for operation, such as under overhead obstructions like power lines – means the concept offers the potential for application to other designs in the Gradall portfolio. Currently, the EL41H4 is still a concept machine and further testing and development is required before the next steps can be decided, the company said.
Following its appearance at ConExpo and at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) display at the National Mall in Washington, DC in May, the EL41H4 will undergo extensive testing and verification to optimize it for the application.

15 March 2023,Volvo hails next-gen excavator as it unveils 50 tonne prototype,"The company said the new machine – which will be made available in regulated markets including Europe and North America – heralds its next generation of large machines, being faster, safer and more productive than predecessor models.
The EC500 – successor to the EC480E – boasts a completely new cab layout, with features including a high-definition co-pilot screen, keyless engine start, wired and wireless smart phone charging and a new work mode switch.
The technology on board the new excavator includes Volvo Smart View with Obstacle Detection. With a combination of enhanced cameras and radar detection, the system gives operators a 360-degree view, as well as delivering alerts when objects are detected, also identifying and classifying them as human.
Volvo says the addition of electric joysticks gives the operator greater control over the hydraulic system.
The excavator’s hydraulic pumps can be operated together as well as virtually disconnected, allowing the operator to control the boom without affecting track speed. This, says Volvo, increases controllability, shortens cycle times and improves fuel efficiency, which has the potential to deliver higher productivity and performance.
Lower costs, greater uptime
The EC500 is designed to cope with extreme weather conditions, featuring greater cooling capacity than its predecessor model. Volvo says service intervals for the hydraulic oil and filter have also been extended, from 2,000 to 3,000 hours, increasing uptime and reducing costs.
Stephen Roy, president of Volvo CE North America, said, “We’re excited to share the first look at our next generation excavator. A pre-production model, there will be some differences to the appearance of the EC500 that will be available to our customers, but it gives an insight into the future, with enhanced safety, operability and productivity.”
Production of the EC500 is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023."

"
28 February 2023,ConExpo 2023: Show Guide,"It’s official: ConExpo-Con/Agg the biggest trade show in North America, is getting even bigger. The Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), the organisers of the event held every three years, has announced that all available exhibit space for the upcoming show has been sold out, guaranteeing the 2023 edition will be the biggest in its history.
“The addition of the new West Hall and Diamond Lot at the Las Vegas Convention Center gave us, and our exhibitors, a number of new opportunities to show how we are taking the construction industry to the next level,” said Dana Wuesthoff, ConExpo-Con/Agg show director. “Now at 2.8 million sq. ft. of exhibits, there’s more for construction pros to see than ever before.”
Nearly 5% bigger than the record set in 2020, the show will feature 1,800 exhibitors and 150 education sessions during its run from March 14-18, 2023.
Despite being the largest show ever, AEM noted that recent additions to the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) will make it the easiest to get around as well. Beneath the entire LVCC campus runs the Convention Center Loop, an underground transportation system designed by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. It transports convention attendees throughout the campus in under two minutes in Tesla vehicles, free of charge.
AEM said attendee registrations were also on strong pace, as pre-registrations are nearly double what they were at the same time for the 2020 show.
“This is the event that construction professionals, especially those making company-level decisions, and those needing professional development hours, can’t miss,” said Caterpillar Senior Vice President Phil Kelliher, who is ConExpo-Con/Agg show chair. “Seeing the new equipment and techniques on a screen doesn’t compare to seeing it all in person.
“At the show, you can see the equipment, ask questions of the manufacturers themselves, and really understand what the equipment and education can do for your career and business.”
A selection of equipment manufacturers are teasing what they have in store for attendees. Alice Banach, senior marketing manager for Doosan Infracore North America, revealed that ConExpo will be the first-time attendees will be able to see the new brand on its construction equipment, hear the story of why it was chosen and what’s coming next.
“In November 2019, Doosan Infracore showed the first successful live demonstration of a fully autonomous excavator and wheel loader. The demonstration took place at our proving grounds in South Korea,” she explains. “We have developed this technology further and will show the next generation of Concept-X in a demonstration area in our exhibit. There will be other new products and technologies on display including the Doosan electric-powered DX20ZE-7 mini excavator.”
The message the company is conveying with its exhibit is a continuation of a long history of orange equipment in North America.
“We are nearing 40 years since we entered this market. We are the same company with the same talented dealers and staff evolving to the next chapter for the industry,” says Banach. “We expect a lot of interest in the new brand, but the most important message is that the machines have not changed, only the name on them,” she said.
The machines on display will include the new DD100 dozer and the first 100-metric-ton crawler excavator: the DX1000LC-7. As for new product introductions, Banach says Doosan will have a few new products that the North American market will see for the first time and some that will be their global debut. “Our second dozer, the DD130, will be shown, as well as the latest working Concept-X models will be on display,” she added.
For its part, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) readies itself for a return to ConExpo for the first time since 2017. The company pulled out of the 2020 show due to looming concerns over the spread of Covid-19, which wound up shortening the show by one day and emptied Las Vegas shortly thereafter.
Stephen Roy, president, Region North America, at Volvo CE, says it’s important for equipment manufacturers to make their presence known to construction industry professionals planning to attend.
“For me, it’s really being able to highlight where Volvo is and where we’re at in our journey during a time that has been transformative in our industry,” he says. “ConExpo-Con/Agg offers us a chance to showcase what we have, gather feedback from our customers and engage our industry partners.
“To really make a show like ConExpo-Con/Agg work, the face-to-face aspect of it is so important,” he adds. “I think that’s why Las Vegas is the perfect venue. It attracts so many people, and with all the changes we’re seeing in our industry, I think it’ll be the perfect environment for people to find the latest and greatest innovations, as well as learn what will help their business succeed.”
Volvo is driving a focus on sustainable power and automation, and how it can help customers be more productive, efficient and successful in their efforts to serve their own customers.
“We always say our goal is to make customers successful with their customers, so that’s the approach we’re taking. More specifically, we’ll have a mix of existing product, product that’s coming out soon and some forward-looking product that – like I mentioned before – will illustrate where the industry is going,” says Roy. “That means a focus on sustainability, using electric machines and other sustainable power.”
Volvo CE will also showcase small compact electric equipment, all the way to larger equipment that has a mix of electric and diesel.
When asked how he feels about Volvo’s return to live, in-person events, Roy says, “We’re very focused on making events and exhibitions like ConExpo-Con/Agg a really valuable experience, so when our attendees are in the booth, they have access to the right information and the right experts who can answer their questions – and we want them to have fun in our booth too.”
Metso Outotec will present its latest innovations, technologies and offerings for the aggregates industry at ConExpo.
“Throughout the whole aggregates and construction industry, sustainability is gaining ground and has become a big driver for innovations and operations,” says Juha Yli-Petäys, SVP, Global Distribution Management at Metso Outotec.
“For us at Metso Outotec, sustainability and improved performance are among our key goals with our customers and present in every R&D project. At ConExpo-Con/Agg, we will demonstrate our groundbreaking innovations that address our customers’ key challenges like energy consumption, uptime, safety or carbon footprint reduction,” he continues.

The F-Series compact milling machine is fitted with a John Deere engine that has been customised to meet the special demands of cold milling applications. Two large F-Series milling machines complete the cold milling machine range on show.
Cold recycling and soil stabilising equipment will also be on show, such as the W 380 CRi as well as the WR 200 XLi and WR 250i. The W 380 CRi with rear loading and a mixing performance of up to 800 t/h is used for rehabilitating wide roads. It can be deployed in both cold in-place recycling (CIR) and in full-depth reclaiming (FDR) projects.
Besides cold recycling, the WR-Series wheel-driven recyclers can also carry out soil stabilising tasks. With a working width of 2.4m (7 ft 10 in) as well as high milling and mixing performances, they are well-equipped for use in demanding projects with high daily outputs. The digital system solutions, the AutoTrac steering system and the WPT (Wirtgen Performance Tracker) documentation system further increase process efficiency.
JCB will present its newly-developed hydrogen internal combustion engine at ConExpo. This will be the debut for the H2 ICE engine in North America and the first time it has been presented outside the UK.
The new engine will be presented as part of the International Fluid Power Exposition (IFPE).
Speaking about the H2 ICE, JCB chairman Lord Bamford, said, “The JCB engineering team has made enormous strides in a short space of time to develop a hydrogen internal combustion engine and it already powers a JCB prototype backhoe loader and a Loadall telescopic handler.
“As the first construction equipment company to develop a fully working combustion engine fuelled by hydrogen, I’m delighted we are now able to present this technology on the international stage.”
The H2 ICE will play a key part in the company’s Road to Zero programme. JCB has already launched what is billed as the world’s first battery-electric mini excavator as part of its E-Tech range.
A range of electric machines produced by JCB will also be on display at the show.
Crushing and screening equipment manufacturer McCloskey will reveal a new colour scheme for its entire product portfolio at ConExpo.
The company, which is known for its distinctive green brand colour, said the updated livery design would create, “a unified and a more contemporary look” across its product range.
Toni Laaksonen, senior vice president at McCloskey International, said, “As McCloskey and its allied brands grow in response to rising demand globally, we continually are seeking new ways to enhance the brand while ensuring we maintain the equity we have built over time.
“This update reflects our commitment to the foundation built on the McCloskey green while refreshing the product line with a modern approach.”
McCloskey’s green colour will now feature on the chassis and galvanized steel handrails of both its existing and new equipment models – which include electric powered and hybrid machines."
21 February 2023,Volvo CE converts mid-sized wheeled loader to electric,"The Swedish manufacturer worked with US-based technology company Parker Hannifin to convert the diesel machine to electric, as part of its strategy of advancing electromobility in construction.
The machine represents the first time Volvo has converted a mid-sized loader in this way and the company says it will be commercially available to selected customers in Europe before the end of this year.
The electric version of the L120H uses the conventional machine as its base and Volvo says that, should demand for the electric version grow, it could convert customers’ existing diesel machines to electric in the future.
Volvo also says it is developing a new business model which will make it easier for its customers to make the leap to electric machines.
Rapid chargingThe L120H loader is powered by 240kWh batteries and Volvo says it has a runtime of approximately five hours in medium duty applications.
The company adds that charging from 0% to 100% can be achieved in between 1.5 and 2 hours and insists that, in all performance aspects, the electric machine is equal to the diesel version.
While the original diesel version of the L120H will still be available to customers, Volvo says it is looking to speed up its roll-out of zero emissions models through electromobility partnerships with companies such as Parker Hannifin, Limach and CE Engineering Solutions.
Partnership modelVolvo insists that partnering with technology firms to convert diesel machines to electric is allowing the company to accelerate the development of larger battery-electric machines, such as the EC230 – a 23 tonne excavator which utilises the company’s own electrification technology.
Carl Slotte, head of sales region Europe at Volvo CE, said, “Our commitment to partnership allows us to take a leading position in transforming our industry, with electric solutions that are built to fulfil market demand and tailored to suit the changing needs of our customers.
“Working together, we are scaling up our portfolio of electric machines, extending the versatility of our range and transforming our industry towards a carbon neutral future.”"
17 February 2023,How are construction OEMs adapting to the circular economy?,"Towards the end of 2021, Sarah Jones, managing director of UK-based plant hire firm Stokey, began exploring the options for replacing the company’s venerable Caterpillar D9 bulldozer which the company had originally bought 14 years earlier and which had clocked up 22,000 machine hours working in quarries around the British Midlands.
Keen to ensure that customers avoided the chances of breakdowns associated with older machines, at first the company had planned to replace the tracked 50,000kg machine with a newer version and either sell off or scrap the old one.
But, inspired by a growing trend in business to reduce carbon emissions and improve its impact on the environment – as well as a wish to cut costs – Jones, like a growing number of other customers, chose to get local Caterpillar dealer Finning to strip down and rebuild the machine instead, replacing the worn parts with used ones which had been returned to a Cat factory and restored or ‘remanufactured’.
Stokey’s decision to choose a certified powertrain (CPT) rebuild, which includes replacing the transmission, engine, differential and final drives with remanufactured alternatives where possible, saved the customer a cool £550,000 compared with the costs of buying a new machine and saved the planet thousands of tonnes of carbon in terms of the energy and resources.
“We’re giving an old machine a completely new lease of life instead of sending it off for resale or worse still, to be broken down and scrapped,” Jones says, posing proudly with the rebuilt machine and sporting a hard hat and hi-vis orange jacket.
Of course, re-using, repairing and reconditioning expensive machinery is nothing new in the construction equipment industry. Independent repair shops, equipment dealers and manufacturers have been offering various levels of repair for well over a century.
But in recent years firms have started taking what has become an industry norm and making a direct connection with meeting company-wide sustainability objectives. Organisations can gain faster near-term value from bringing back existing products and reusing them and incorporating innovations that help achieve net zero and net neutral goals across supply chains.
Caterpillar’s dealers have been running a certified rebuilds programme since 1985, carrying out on each machine over 350 tests and examining 7,000 parts to provide customers with a like-new machine, complete with Cat warranty.
Certified Rebuilds
Mark Holden, product support account manager at Finning UK & Ireland, says that by re-using the most hard-wearing parts of the machine and replacing only the parts which needed it, Stokey’s rebuild cost the company £300,000 (€339,500) compared with the £850,000 o buy a new equivalent D9 dozer. And the rebuilt dozer also costs the planet less in terms of the amount of raw materials and carbon used to make it.
“While the engine, transmission and other key components will eventually need replacing before they fail and cause operational issues, the main chassis and body of the machine is structurally sound so can be stripped back and restored to its former glory and used again and again,” he says.
The Stokey rebuild
In the case of Stokey’s D9 bulldozer rebuild, the entire process lasted from April until June 2022, starting with a pre-repair inspection carried out by Finning lead service engineer Lane Armstrong and was followed by a month-long workshop strip down during which two engineers painstakingly disassembled all external and internal components and sorted through them.
A third stage comprises an in-depth inspection of the machine, looking along the chassis, inspecting the state of the hose work and identifying any damage to the mounts or brakes.
Only after this are the technicians able to provide a recommendation for a full scope of work required and provide a cost and timetable to the customer.
Once agreed, service controller Simon Benton then oversaw the project, ordering in the major components including a remanufactured engine from Caterpillar as well as using Finning service exchange units for components such as final drive units.

Remanufacturing is becoming more and more important within the sustainability goals of OEMs and their dealers.
It means that rather than replacing the D9’s worn engine with a new one, taking up more valuable material and resources, engineers can get hold of a used engine from a previous customer which has been shipped back to the manufacturer and restored to original factory conditions before being returned to the dealer and re-sold at a cheaper price than a new one but offering the same performance and with a manufacturer’s warranty to match.
As well as being the world’s largest construction equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar is also one of the world’s largest remanufacturers, officially offering the service since 1973. And before that, the company boasts that it has been carrying out refurbishments and repairs. It points out that one of the original tractors built by Cat’s predecessor company, Holt Manufacturing Company in 1917, is still in operation today. Components can be remanufactured up to six times.
What is remanufacturing?
Over the last 40 years Cat says its dealers have rebuilt an estimated 37,000 machines, powertrains and components and in 2021 alone they returned 127 million pounds of material to Cat remanufacturing facilities for processing. The sales price of Cat Reman products includes a ‘core deposit’ worth around the same as the value of the materials themselves, which the manufacturer says provides an economic incentive to eventually return the component.
In 2021 the company announced a sustainability goal to increase sales and revenue from Cat Reman by 25% by 2030 from 2018 levels.
The reasons behind this are both environmental and strategic.
Cat says that restoring a cylinder head to factory conditions requires 85% less energy than manufacturing a new one, generating 61% fewer greenhouse gasses. It also uses 86% less water and requires 85% less material. Remanufactured engines are sent to dealers who then use them as part of a comprehensive rebuild.
Moreover, the company estimates that around 35% of its costs lie in overheads, while the majority (65%) are materials costs. So salvaging materials gives a greater business advantage for the company over its competitors.
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity set up by the former British yachtswoman to promote the circular economy, singles out both Caterpillar and aerial platform manufacturer JLG as examples of companies which are successfully moving towards a circular economy by adopting innovative business models.
The foundation cites Caterpillar for providing customers with “multiple product life extension options,” including remanufacturing, rebuilding and second-hand sales.
“The circular economy framework places emphasis on the importance of designing effective products and systems rather than aiming solely for efficiency.
“Caterpillar have employed this strategy in their own product design, and rather than aiming to use less and less material, increasing amounts of consideration goes into creating a product that is intended to be remanufactured a number of times,” the foundation says.
Cat boasts that its equipment is ‘built to be rebuilt’. One of its most cited examples is an engine block with a removable sleeve in the cylinder bore. When the component is recovered, this material can be removed and replaced to return the engine to as-new performance. Previous techniques for remanufacturing engine blocks have involved re-boring the engine cylinder and using a larger piston, but this can only be done up to three times before the quality of the product is affected.
And it’s not just Caterpillar which has big plans to harness the circular economy more. Other manufacturers have also recently announced ambitious growth targets for their own remanufacturing and rebuilding operations.
Volvo Construction Equipment has a target of increasing its remanufacturing business by 60% by 2025 compared with a 2018 baseline. The company also says it expects to see a big growth in its certified rebuilds, driven by sustainability goals, cost-saving initiatives and by the recent supply chain crisis which has made it difficult to get hold of new machines.
Harnessing the circular economy
“We expect to see a significant increase in the number of certified rebuilds carried out in 2023 compared to 2022,” says Hilton Wood, Pennsylvania-based product manager for sales development and aftermarket products and services at Volvo CE. Compared with previous years, rebuilds are receiving more attention and quoting activity is increasing due to tight availability and high demand for machines. An added benefit is the sustainability aspect.”
Hitachi Construction Machinery too reports that customers are increasingly considering refurbishing their own equipment. The company has remanufacturing facilities in 21 locations around the world in ten countries, employing approximately 400 people.
“Cost is undoubtedly a main driver but we are noticing an increasing interest in the circular economy, especially in Scandinavian countries,” says Rob Feskens, parts sales representative at Hitachi Construction Machinery.
“This is often stimulated and driven by government regulations put in place to encourage contractors to work in a more environmentally and sustainable manner.”
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation praises JLG’s partnership with finance company DLL which encourages customers to return equipment to JLG at the end of their lease contracts, allowing JLG to plan and predict when assets will reach its workshop for reconditioning.
“JLG’s reconditioned business pipeline for 2023 is very strong,” says Chris Mellott, VP of sales & service at JLG. “Since the program launched in 1997, it has grown through all economic conditions, regardless of the market conditions (supply chain constraints, looming recession, etc).”
Manufacturers are also highlighting retrofitting services too as another way of extending the life of machinery whilst also reducing carbon emissions.
In February, French OEM Manitou announced that it had signed a deal with rental company Kiloutou to investigate retrofit electrification kits for the manufacturer’s diesel-powered telehandlers. The kits, which will comprise lithium-ion batteries, will open the door to switching from internal combustion to low carbon full electric motors.
“The possibility of giving machines in our fleet a second life, and lowering their emissions, is a key lever in our drive to reduce our indirect emissions,” said François Renault, group fleet and sustainability director of Kiloutou Group. “We are working particularly hard these days to fast track this circular economy solution.”
Extending the life of construction equipment
German construction equipment manufacturer Liebherr reports a similar trend. “Since 2022, we have noticed an increase in customer requests for upgrades and overhauls,” says Wolfgang Pfister, head of strategic marketing and communications at Liebherr.
“What is striking is that customers are looking to apply their machines for a wider range of operations. To stay competitive, our customers require more versatile and multi-purpose machines. The current train of thought is definitely also heading towards longevity and sustainability. The global awareness of green thinking is constantly growing.”
Yet, despite these grand sounding plans, some remain sceptical whether growing remanufacturing businesses is achievable – or even desirable – for OEMs.
One of the key reasons for this is that current rebuilding and remanufacturing practices are highly people intensive. Although much of the construction process for new machinery is automated and done by robotics, disassembly is still done by hand, with engineers inspecting each piece to decide which can be re-used or salvaged for remanufacture and which can only be scrapped.
The nature of the process means that remanufacturing is only currently profitable for the most valuable components such as steel engine components or gears. Even amongst this group, not all components are suitable for remanufacturing, with many too worn or degraded to be considered worthwhile repairing.
Liebherr estimates that remanufacturing results in savings in material of between 75% and 78%, resulting in a reduction in the carbon footprint of a crankshaft by 66% and a crankcase by 61%.
However, the researchers calculate that when rejects are taken into account, the reductions in carbon footprint for both remanufactured elements falls to around half that of its newly manufactured equivalent.
Similarly, the actual remanufacturing processes can also be inefficient and carbon intensive, with cast iron components often requiring welding at pre-heat temperatures greater than 315°C.
And, with most manufacturers only using a few facilities to provide the service globally, many heavy components must be transported long distances, which also adds to their carbon footprint.
Remanufacturing research projects
In order to find ways to increase the amount of material which can easily be remanufactured - and more effective and energy efficient ways of doing it - OEMs and governments are investing heavily in research and development.
The REMADE Institute, a public-private partnership established by the US department of Energy as well as OEMs including Caterpillar, John Deere, Michelin and Nike and academic research institutions such as MIT, Rochester Institute of Technology and Yale, has since 2017 handed out millions of dollars in research grants aimed at looking at just these issues.
Current projects include working with remanufacturing firms to come up with a set of design guidelines which would allow design engineers to integrate remanufacturing considerations into their components in the first place, as well as using machine learning techniques to recognise different types of component damage and to develop a real-time estimate of remanufacturing costs.
Researchers in the Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Pittsburgh are collaborating with Caterpillar on a wide range of projects aimed at increasing the proportion of worn steel components which can be remanufactured such as developing high-tech practical repair techniques to relieve stress in components which are currently unusable and using high speed laser cladding for remanufactured crankshafts and camshafts which is expected to increase the reuse rate from 70% to 95%. The partners are also developing a robust weld repair process that can be achieved at lower temperatures.
Furthermore, the institute is funding research aimed at increasing the range of materials which can be repaired or remanufactured. These include using micro abrasion techniques or laser abrasion to remove the potting material surrounding circuit boards and using automated methods to detect solder joint and interconnection failures on used electronics.
And yet, despite all of this, remanufacturing comprises just a fraction of the business, with most OEMs firmly focused on the more lucrative process of making and selling machines.
Caterpillar’s goal to increase sales and revenue from Cat Reman by 25% by 2030 from 2018 levels comes after the company came short on a previous sustainability goal to grow remanufacturing revenue by 20% from 2013 to 2020 – something the company explained on a fall in overall demand during the first year of the Covid pandemic and on the company’s decision to stop manufacturing on-highway truck engines. The company does not disclose separate remanufacturing revenues.
Agricultural and construction equipment maker Deere & Co, which does disclose the figures from its remanufacturing division, said that revenues stood at $360.4m in 2021 – less than 1% of the company total during the period.
Under Deere’s latest sustainability targets, it plans to grow that figure by 50% to reach $540.6m by 2030. Progress so far is modest: in 2022, the company said revenues from the division grew by 2% to £367.6m.
Bert Avezaat, director of Dutch crane repair specialist Avezaat which specialises in repairing cranes from any manufacturer, says that although the demand for repairs, rebuilds and remanufacturing is getting stronger, businesses like his see little in terms of competition from OEMs who are mostly still concerned with a linear economy model of manufacturing and selling as many new machines as possible for profit.
“In general, the OEMs are more focused on supplying new cranes or parts,” he says. “They carry out repairs but it is not their main business.”
Manufacturers’ focus is still the linear economy
Some customers also remain wary of remanufactured products, preferring the reassurance and prestige of a new product. According to Alexander Pajari, product support director for Volvo CE, raising awareness of the remanufacturing process is a challenge for the manufacturer in China, for example, where any second hand items are traditionally viewed with suspicion.
Moreover, some may worry that by focusing so much on remanufacturing successes in their sustainability goals, OEMs may distract attention from setting goals to cut their own significant carbon footprints. Manufacturers are coming under increasing pressure to slash emissions in line with the Paris Agreement – a process which is likely to cause significant disruption to current working practices.
But back at Finning’s workshop in the West Midlands, Stokey’s Sarah Jones has been converted.
“This experience has certainly opened our eyes to the prospect of considering more rebuilds – both in terms of the financial gains over replacing with a new machine, but with sustainability in mind as well,” she says."
17 February 2023,Volvo CE invests to boost electric excavator production capacity,"Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has invested SEK80 million (US$7.8 million) into battery pack production at its excavator plant in Changwon, South Korea,
The investment will enable the building of a new production facility at the Changwon plant in South Korea. The plant – which is already the largest excavator production site in Volvo CE, producing around 55% of its total excavator volumes – is already 1.1 million square metres in size.
Once complete the facility will be approximately 2,500 sq. metres including assembly and logistics areas.
The new facility will produce a wide range of common electric storage solutions (battery packs) for Volvo Group and become a core competence center for electric excavators. This will enable Volvo Group to offer more sustainable solutions to its Asia-Pacific markets in a more flexible, cost-effective and agile way and will include supply chain, manufacturing and logistics.
“As the largest plant in Volvo CE and the core site for excavator development and production, Changwon is at the forefront of our shift to a sustainable future,” said Andy Knight, head of operations excavator and MD of Volvo Group Korea.
“This investment is an important milestone in our electrification roadmap and supports our recent investments in production facilities for electric excavators. Changwon is ideally located close to battery module supply partners and other key suppliers in South Korea to meet the needs of customers in the future.”
The new production facility will be built inside the current component workshop at Changwon – without disruption to the existing operation. The building work will begin in April 2023, with battery pack production expected to commence in June 2024.
Volvo CE recently announced investment in the production of electric wheeled loaders at its plant in Arvika, Sweden, and electric haulers from the company’s production facility in Braås, Sweden. The OEM has introduced compact electric excavators to the global market with the ECR25 Electric, ECR18 Electric, EC18 Electric and the mid-size EC230 Electric excavators."
13 February 2023,Five construction equipment trends for 2023,"
The Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), a North American-based trade association and the organisers of ConExpo have spoken to industry experts who have highlighted five equipment trends that will shape 2023.
In 2021 online sales of automobiles reached 30% of the market, their highest level. In July 2022, Ford announced it would move sales of its electric vehicles online at a fixed price, following Volvo and Tesla. “Whatever happens in the auto industry, is coming to construction equipment dealerships,” says Garry Bartecki, CFO of a Top 100 rental company and former CFO of the Associated Equipment Distributors (AED).
In a 2021 study from McKinsey & Company, sponsored by AED, more than 40% of off-highway dealers surveyed think it is very likely or somewhat likely that the OEM(s) they represent will implement a direct-to-consumer model within five years. They expect fully digital sales (including the actual purchase) for new equipment to increase from 7% to 29% and digital rentals to increase from 7% to 33% within five years.
“We definitely see things moving in this direction,” says Jefferson Yin, Director of New Business Models and Commercial Intelligence at Volvo Construction Equipment. In 2020, the company began allowing customers to pre-order new electric equipment online, and they recently launched an online configuration tool for those machines, which allows customers to “build and price” their ideal model.
“There will still be transportation, delivery, and service, but it will be much more efficient,” explains Steve Clegg, Managing Director and Owner of Winsby, Inc., a business development firm with clients in the construction equipment industry.
“Dealers are behind the curve and contractors are ahead of the curve when it comes to utilizing the Internet,” says Ron Slee, Managing Director Learning Without Scars, a training resource for dealers. The shift to e-commerce creates what he calls “the Amazon effect,” which means dealers will have to transition from selling things to selling services.
Electrification of construction equipment is in its early stages, but Grand View Research reports that the global off-highway electric vehicle market size is expected to reach US$42 billion by 2030. Growth will be driven by lower operating costs as well as improved battery technology and lower costs for batteries. “You are going to see the whole industry switch to battery-operated or hybrid machines,” says Clegg. “The amount of parts drops by about 90%, so if your operating costs for a skid-steer were $20 an hour, that drops to $3 per hour.”
Dealers make their money on parts and services, and a high absorption rate (+85%) is a key focus. This metric is an indication of how well the margin from parts and services covers all the expenses of the dealership.
“Electric machines will cut the maintenance costs, so the dealers will make less money and the OEMS will make less money,” says Bartecki. “It’s a whole new ball game.”
To make up for the difference, dealerships will have to focus on new revenue sources. “Because they have the service expertise, I would recommend they move into supporting and servicing batteries, providing services such as recharging vehicles, tires, wear parts, and repair,” says Clegg. “They can also expand into different lines of equipment.”
Nearly all new construction equipment machinery is equipped with technology that allows equipment owners and dealers to avoid downtime through preventative maintenance and early detection of mechanical issues. The challenge has been getting equipment owners on board. “Across the industry, adoption of telematics is definitely under 50%, and maybe only 30%,” says Henderson.
“The dealer has the trust of their customer, but they tend to be a single brand, while most customers have mixed fleets,” says Hanna.
Slee believes OEMs have tried to protect their own at the expense of the marketplace, but he’s starting to see some signs of change. “The machines need to be able to talk to each other as they do in other industries,” says Slee.
According to Jim Bretz, Director of Service and Solutions for Volvo CE, about 60% of Volvo’s connected machines use the company’s advanced telematics system, ActiveCare Direct. These machines are monitored 24/7/365 for alarms that indicate an issue. Actionable information (an ACD case) is then sent directly to the customer’s equipment manager and the local dealer within minutes. Included is information that will help the customer address the issue without the help of a dealer.
Parts are the bread and butter of a dealership, but for an end-user, buying parts is anything but easy. When a machine is down, the costs are astounding and end-users and rental dealers are likely to pay a premium to get a quality part as quickly as possible. Buyers often need guidance; that may mean multiple phone calls and texts from multiple sources, including OEM and aftermarket parts dealers. Each part of the distribution chain has its own distribution, logistics, and markup.
According to Slee, OEM dealer market share for parts has dropped to 35-40%, about half of what it once was. Buyers today simply have more options, including Amazon.
Luke Powers, CEO of Gearflow, a web-based platform, believes dealers will soon be competing directly with Amazon. “MRO supplies are the first entry point of Amazon coming into the industrial markets,” says Powers. “Amazon wants all procurement to be done on its platform regardless of the industry. Private-label brands in the construction equipment industry are the logical next step after adding MRO to their selection.”
Rental is expected to continue its upward trajectory fueled by higher prices for construction machinery and rising interest rates. According to the America Rental Association, construction equipment rental revenue is expected to increase 12.5% in 2022 to surpass US$41.6 billion.
The concept of equipment-as-a-service, which would transfer responsibility for equipment to the manufacturer or dealer, allowing customers to focus on their core business, is also gaining interest. Unlike equipment rental, it might involve an entire fleet to be provided for several years with the potential to tie invoicing directly to usage.
Slee believes the concept has potential. “Contractors use the machine to dig a hole. They are only interested in the hole, and they look at the equipment merely as an operating cost,” he says.
Volvo CE is currently exploring the concept. “One of the most positive aspects from a customer perspective is the payment flexibility that this model offers since it’s usually linked to machine utilization,” says Dr. Ray Gallant, Vice President of Product Management and Productivity for Volvo CE.
“It’s a very customised offer and it requires that the OEM, dealer, and customer are aligned so the fleet performs accordingly and delivers the expected results.”"
13 February 2023,Volvo Trucks and Cemex collaborate on electric concrete mixer truck,"Cemex has announced that Volvo Trucks has supplied the company with the world’s first fully electric and zero-emission heavy concrete mixer truck at a joint event hosted in Berlin, Germany.
The truck is part of an agreement signed between the companies in 2021 to improve productivity and carbon emissions reductions through the implementation of electromobility solutions on mobile construction equipment and trucks, productivity solutions, and uptime services.
Volvo and CEMEX are working to discover, pilot, and scale the technologies needed to make emissions-free transport also a reality in the construction industry.
The company says that the Volvo FMX electric truck can be used for a full day’s work with a single top-up charge. It will be operating at the Berlin Spandau ready-mix plant in Berlin, starting this month.
“We are very happy to take this important step in the partnership with Cemex. Both our companies have committed to ambitious sustainability targets and collaboration is the way to get there.
“Together we will work to implement CO2-neutral transport in the construction industry. Our electric trucks are zero emissions and their silent operation also provides a better environment for people working at construction sites, as well as for residents living in the city,” said Roger Alm, President of Volvo Trucks."
31 January 2023,More OEMs confirmed for IRE and APEX,"Almost 200 suppliers will exhibit at the International Rental Exhibition (IRE) and APEX exhibitions in Maastricht, The Netherlands on 6 to 8 June this year.
Thera are as many as 80 exhibitors at IRE and around 120 at the aerial platform show APEX.
IRE exhibitors will include Atlas Copco, Ditch Witch, Generac, Hitachi, JCB, Kaeser, Thwaites, Trackunit, Volvo CE and Yanmar CE.
Among suppliers at APEX will be Dingli, Genie, JLG, Haulotte, Manitou, Ruthmann, Skyjack, Snorkel and XCMG.
IRE and APEX 2023 will be co-located with the European Rental Association Convention, including the European Rental Awards on 7 June.
The two shows were last held in 2017, having been cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic.
They exhibitors at the two shows will provide rental companies with a complete line up of compact construction equipment, aerial platforms and rental IT solutions. Many companies will display their latest battery powered equipment and tools.
Tony Kenter, Managing Director of Industrial Promotions International B.V (IPI), which is organising the exhibitions alongside KHL Group, said the shows’ programme and format were timely in light of current global challenges.
“The shows will help rental companies and contractors who are managing the transition to low-emission equipment.
“At one convenient location, APEX and IRE will give equipment buyers the perfect snapshot of what is available.

26 January 2023,North America drives Volvo CE sales,"Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has revealed that sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 were up for the OEM in all markets compared to the same quarter last year, with North America seeing the highest increase at 54%.
In the fourth quarter of 2022 net sales increased by 27% to SEK 27,596 M (US$2.7 billion), with a contribution from both machine sales and the service market. Adjusted for currency movements, net sales increased by 13%, of which net sales of machines were up by 15% and service sales remained on a similar level.
For the full year 2022, net sales rose 9% amounting to SEK 100,261 M (US$9.8 billion). Adjusted operating income for the full year totalled SEK 13,244 M (US$1.3 billion), corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 13.2%.
The very strong growth in North American sales has been attributed to strong activity in the infrastructure segment. China, the world’s largest construction equipment market, saw a rise in sales as, despite the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns, the new National IV emission standard regulations stimulated sales.
Although sales in Q4 increased from Q3, sales in Q4 2022 were down by 23% compared to the same quarter in 2021. Volvo CE says that this is, “largely due to restrictive order slotting caused by large order books and long lead times in North America and Europe, as well as stopped sales in Russia.”
However, deliveries increased by 4% due to emission regulations coming into effect in China and the good demand in North America and Asia.
Activity in the construction industry has remained good across many regions, primarily driven by ongoing infrastructure investments and favourable commodity prices. Underlying demand in the North American market remained solid due to steady infrastructure activity and in South America, the overall market in Q4 was impacted by a slowdown of investments in Brazil. In Europe, the market remained relatively steady despite signals of a weakening business climate.
Most Asian markets enjoyed continued high demand for commodities, partially off-set by lower construction activity in key markets such as South Korea and Thailand.
Melker Jernberg, Head of Volvo CE, says, “We continue to take steps in our transformation journey – continuing to deliver reliable, efficient and more sustainable solutions fit for our customers’ needs today, while driving investment across our business towards our fossil-free future.”
Volvo CE has recently introduced an automatic braking feature Collision Mitigation System for its wheeled loaders and a largescale investment into its facility in Braås, Sweden. Over the coming years the plant will be adapted to produce a larger range of articulated haulers with different types of powertrains, including electric."
23 January 2023,Volvo CE invests in electric wheeled loaders,"Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has invested US$6.3 million into new facilities at the Arvika factory in Sweden to allow the OEM to accelerate the production of electric wheel loaders.
The announcement comes as part of an investment strategy that allows Volvo CE to advance electric solutions across its production facilities, including the Konz facility in Germany, Belley in France and Changwon in South Korea, where other electric machines are made.
With the company’s investment, Arvika will erect a new building that will allow the facility to free up areas inside its assembly factory to be able to build electric wheeled loaders.
Volvo CE says that it has not yet been announced which models will begin their electric transformation and exactly when, but the hope is that the factory will produce reliable mid-size and larger electric wheeled loaders.
Building work is set to begin later this year with further announcements on when production will begin announced soon."
18 January 2023,Volvo CE debuts its first electric compactor,"Set to debut at ConExpo-Con/Agg 2023, the DD25 Electric asphalt compactor is Volvo CE’s first electric machine produced specifically for the company’s road segment.
Volvo CE designed the compact double-drum compactor for small-scale compaction projects including street repairs and patching, parking lots, driveways, municipalities and rental houses.
Dr. Ray Gallant, vice president of Product Management and Productivity at Region Americas, Volvo CE, said that after the DD25 Electric’s introduction at ConExpo, the company expects to take orders for the compactor later in 2023, with deliveries in the first quarter of 2024.
The machine will initially be available in North America, with other markets to follow at a later date.
Volvo CE said the DD25 Electric is an important milestone in the manufacturer’s ambition to reach net-zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 and is part of Volvo Group’s target to have at least 35% of its total range of vehicles fully electric by 2030.
“As a global leader in construction solutions, delivering premium products and services, we not only have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, but [also] we are committed to leading the way and providing real-life solutions for our customers that will help them meet their own sustainability goals,” Gallant said. “We are proud to expand our portfolio of electric machines and extend our offering to the road segment.”
Based on the design and components of Volvo CE’s ECR25 Electric compact excavator and L25 Electric compact wheel loader — which were the first electric machines available to the construction market in 2020, according to the company —  the DD25’s Electric driveline makes it ideal for urban environments with strict emission regulations and for organizations looking to meet their own sustainability goals, Volvo said.
The DD25 Electric incorporates LED lighting, a full-color operator display, an onboard ac charging port which enables charging to 100% in as little as three hours, and a 48 V remote dc fast charger that Volvo CE said can fully charge the battery in a little over an hour.
The machine’s runtime is a full typical working shift, depending on the type of job and intensity of the work cycle, the company said.
The DD25 Electric offers 24 kW of available power, 30% more than the conventional Volvo DD25B. The manufacturer said the result is a more responsive machine in terms of speed and vibrations.
The electric machine performs better on grade, thanks to the size of its components, and better at high elevations, when compared to a diesel machine that loses power as it increases altitude, Volvo CE said.
Equipped with 360° visibility and high-frequency compaction, the DD25 Electric allows operators to achieve a smooth finish asphalt surface with speed, and the frequency can be adjusted from 3500 vpm at 55 Hz to 4000 vpm at 67 Hz to accomodate different applications, Volvo CE said.
“[The DD25 Electric] is productive, sustainable and offers good [total cost of ownership],” Gallant said. “It’s about making the whole site better, more efficient and more productive.”"
16 January 2023,Sustainable road building: latest electric launches,"Construction is an essential industry and road building is right at the heart of that definition of ‘essential’ – roads will always need to be built and maintained.
It is very difficult – if not impossible – to quantify the exact length of all roads in the world combined, but best estimates put the figure at around 60 million km.
The need for new roads will only increase as the global population rises, but the construction industry is coming under pressure to meet these demands in increasingly sustainable ways.
At Bauma Munich last October major players from the road building sector revealed some of their solutions to this issue.
For instance, at the Ammann stand electric and environmentally friendly releases were a key focus among the comprehensive array of equipment on display.
New for the Swiss-based construction machinery manufacturer was the eARX 26-2, an electric version of the ARX 26-2 tandem roller, for narrow construction sites or along curbs.
“For us, the ‘e’ is the important part of the name,” Ammann Germany International Key Account Manager, Patrick Stellwag, told KHL during a walk around the stand.
“It’s the first machine you can work a full shift on one charge; and we are providing our rental clients the possibility to work emissions free.
Green construction innovators, Dura Products, is helping leading UK infrastructure contractor Colas, reduce scope three Co2e emissions from its latest highways project on the A46 road in the UK by over 82,000kg.
Approximately 2,680m of the company’s eco-friendly, lightweight, heavy duty combined kerb and drainage system,
Duradrain, will be installed as part of the project, which involves the construction of a new bridge and the realignment of slip roads to form the basis of a new gyratory system which will reduce delays and improve road safety in the future.
One of the aims of the project was to ensure a low environmental impact by using low carbon materials and technology.
Made from 70% recycled material, Duradrain is said to offer savings of over 30,000kg for every 1,000m of Combined Kerb & Drainage units installed compared with traditional solutions it provides an eco-friendly method of draining highways or any structure with a kerb edge.
Ian Burton from Hauraton UK, who supplied and distributed the materials on site, said, “In the current climate it is very important to consider the environment and carbon footprint.
So, to be part of a supply chain that can deliver a successful project and meet this requirement is a great success.”
“It’s electrified throughout, both in the driving and the compaction. There is very little need for hydraulic oil, which is also an environmental plus,” he said.
Ammann Commercial Manager Leos Tymel added that the machine is designed to optimise energy usage. “We are not only using the energy from the battery; we are also returning it to the machine – what does the roller do? It starts, drives, and stops.
“During the stops the energy returns through re-charge,” he says.
“The machine can be charged in three hours via quick charging or in 12 hours with an onboard charger, using single phase or three phase standard mains electricity.”
Tymel added that to make it easier for operators to get used to it, the user interface hadn’t changed from the diesel version.
Ammann also showed the electric eAPF 12/40, due for market release in February – an electric version of the APF 12/40 compactor, for small soil and asphalt work.
According to Raman Ojha, global head of Shell Construction and Road, there are several challenges when it comes to making road building sustainable.
“There are multiple challenges to decarbonising road building, the most noticeable being the fragmented nature of the industry, which is why it will take collaboration across the entire value chain to overcome them,” he comments.
“A combination of technology, low-carbon solutions, and supportive regulation can accelerate progress to net-zero.”
Shell has recently developed Shell Construction and Road, an integrated sector team collaborating with customers to develop a tailored portfolio of low carbon and circular solutions to help solve decarbonisation challenges and meet the industry’s sustainability goals.
Ojha believes that lowering demand for virgin resources through design and process optimisation and increasing closed-loop circularity for materials must play a key role in decarbonising construction.
He adds, “Asphalt is already one of the world’s most recycled materials, and the increased use of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement exemplifies the benefits of increasing circularity for the industry.”
At Bauma Munich GOMACO introduced the CC-1200e, the world’s first battery-powered slipform curb machine, to the international market.
The electric curb machine is equipped with a 48 VDC lithium-ion battery pack for a paver with zero-exhaust emissions, reduced vibrations, and no engine noise.
The company says that the lithium-ion batteries provide enough power for a full day of paving and charging options include the standard five to six-hour normal charge rate or an optional quick charge system.
Mark Brenner, controls engineering manager at GOMACO, says, “This product is not just changing from diesel to electric – there are a whole host of improvements and new features that we have added.”
He revealed that the machine could run for seven hours and that, due to the motor only spinning as much as required, it was much more efficient.
“This is not a concept model, it is available commercially and it is the world’s first,” he said.
It features the GOMACO G+ control system with a full function radio remote control that puts machine operations in the hands of the operator.
Travel control, manual three-point grade control, cross auger directional controls, vibrator control dial, warning lights, and emergency stop are all located on the remote’s control panel.
At only 2.6m (8.2 ft) long and 2.38m (7.8 ft) wide, the CC-1200e was built for mobility and navigating around job sites.
Its rear track and two front-wheel assemblies allow up to 28.3 meters per minute auxiliary travel speed to move from one pour to the next or loading/unloading on a new project.
Brenner added that the company sees the opportunity to “scale up” in the future and power larger machines with electric power as the technology develops and becomes more powerful and cost-effective.
Jean-Claude Fayat, CEO of Fayat, also spoke about the increasing electrification of road construction equipment at Bauma Munich.
Talking to KHL, he described the increasing electrification of road construction equipment.
“The world is changing,” he said, adding, “You have a significant number of [electric] machines that are not studies, they are ready to sell.
“The question is, what will be the future? This I don’t know, but that step-by-step it will increase is obvious.
“It’s pushed by all the municipalities that oblige contractors who want to tender [for contracts] to include some low-emission carbon within their response.
“If a contractor cannot offer that, he has no chance.”
Fayat said a greater percentage of his company’s research and development funding was also being shifted towards the development of hydrogen solutions, but also insisted that diesel still has a place within road construction equipment.
He said, “I’m not so sure that the main issue for pollution, for the environment, is the diesel engine, but, in the end, these are political decisions.”
Fayat said recent studies had shown that the effect on the environment of modern diesel engines is limited, but that the push from authorities to decarbonise equipment would continue.
He added that, “Perfect solutions do not exist” and no energy would ever be fully clean. “There are compromises between the different solutions and at the end we’ll create the least impactful solution for the environment,” he commented.
Across the whole of construction, from equipment manufacturers to engineering companies and contractors, ambitious sustainability and carbon reduction targets are being made.
Japan-based Sumitomo is no exception, with Norihiro Kumagi, General Manager of the company, revealing that, “Together with our parent company, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, we have built up our sustainability targets to become carbon neutral.
“From the operations side it is a little bit of a headache as it such a high target and difficult to achieve,” he says.
“But if we ignore such targets then we must be kicked out from the market and we need to accommodate with the trend of sustainability.”
He added that, regarding electric-powered equipment, “certainly the tipping point is coming soon, and we are preparing battery electric machines at the moment.”
One of the leading players in road construction, the Wirtgen Group, put sustainability front and centre at Bauma with many of the company’s 97 exhibits – including 37 world premieres – focused on sustainability.
The spotlight among the world premiere machines and innovations was on battery-electric tandem rollers from Hamm, the battery-electric mini road pavers from Vögele, and the all-electric impact crusher from Kleemann.
The two Wirtgen compact milling machines with comfort cabin, the Vögele Dash 5 generation road paver, and the Benninghoven REVOC system, a catalytic converter for asphalt mixing plants, also caused considerable interest, according to the company.
In addition to the individual machines, the company also presented production systems providing complete road construction solutions.
Bringing together solutions from across the whole lifecycle of road building can provide the greatest ecological and economic potential lies – solutions that cover everything from cold recycling and asphalt recycling to emission-free applications in cities and other sensitive locations.
Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has introduced electrically heated fixed screeds to make large-scale paving more cost-effective and to boost the productivity and efficiency of major road projects.
The OEM says that the MB122 and VTD121 Electro Thermo Controlled fixed screeds produce speedy, consistent and evenly spread heating from a single source of power.
Powered by a 55kVA on-board generator, there is no longer a need for customers to refill gas bottles to heat the screed.
“For customer satisfaction it was important to realise a short heating up time for saving time and money.
“During development we had a close collaboration together with the supplier which helped us to optimise the system and realise our target of 40 minutes,” commented Frank Dörrie, Global Product Manager at Volvo CE.
“This is finally a much shorter heating up time than the paver market was able before for a fixed screed offer with electric heating.
“A challenge for testing the new screed was finding a customer with a paving project of approx. 12m paving width. This is not very often the case in Europe.
“But eventually we found a customer in Germany building a large parking area.”
These fixed screeds are now available on the Volvo P6820D ABG, P7820D ABG and P8820D ABG models.
They have been designed to lay everything from hot asphalt through to dry lean Roller-Compacted Concrete and Cement-Bound Materials, all the way to railway ballast and graded mineral mixes.
A new on-board diagnostic function helps to check the condition of the heating bars and detect if and where a replacement is needed, reducing downtime.
Talking about them in relation to sustainability, Dörrie said that the new product, “helps to reduce the overall engine running time due to the shorter heating up time.
“This helps to reduce Total Cost of Ownership for engine hours, working hours and fuel consumption, which ends in a reduction of the CO2 footprint.”
Formula One’s Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi has undergone changes to several of the racetrack’s turns — a resurfacing project was undertaken with the help of the latest paving technology from Topcon Positioning Group.
Construction firm Colas was contracted to resurface the circuit and used Topcon’s technology for the milling, resurfacing and track creation process.
Throughout the project, Colas says that they utilised a wide range of Topcon technology, including its SmoothRide workflow, Pocket3D technology, total stations and HiPer VR Global Navigation Satellite System.
The combination of technology is said to have provided the milling and paving machines with the accurate data models needed to realise the track.
Mouad Moubine, operations manager at Colas, said, “This meant work could commence swiftly and to the specification needed.
Using more traditional methods can mean issues are left undiscovered or uneven sections are simply paved over with a constant thickness, exacerbating the uneven track.
“With Topcon’s SmoothRide workflow, the data collected by the 3D scans was turned into a model of the circuit, which could be compared against a model of the desired end result to determine exactly what needed to be done in the following stages.”
Most areas of construction have improved over the past decades including asphalt roller vibration systems.
Today, the state of the art is automatic compaction to a desired final stiffness.
This enables users to select a job profile and the roller self adjusts to provide rapid compaction with no further intervention.
Fully automated self-driving rollers have been presented as prototypes but still appear to be some way off – so, what’s next?
Ensuring a smooth road first time has a key role to play in sustainability; if the job is done right first time and doesn’t require re-work, saving materials and carbon.
Surprisingly, the degree of smoothness is currently only assessed once compaction work has been completed, making any correction of errors costly.
A mobile scanner that can measure the smoothness of the road during compaction could avoid this, but compaction rollers are unsuitable for carrying such high-precision measuring equipment.
A solution could be a fully autonomous measuring rover that travels with the other machines during road construction.
The rover could be a fairly small vehicle, as it would only need to carry a number of electronic sensors to evaluate the road surface.
The surface smoothness level measured could be wirelessly transmitted to anyone with a display device. In addition to waves and irregularities, such a mobile measuring rover could also assess the roughness of the road surface.
Incorporating an autonomous road surface scanner into quality control could allow for the building of higher-quality roads in the future."
13 January 2023,Why construction equipment OEMs are making acquisitions,"Ola Kinnander, media relations manager at mining equipment giant Epiroc, reels off a list of names; Mernok Elektronik (South Africa), Remote Control Technologies (Australia), Wain-Roy (US), RNP Mexico; just a few of the companies the mining equipment giant has acquired in 2022.
“Acquisitions are part of our strategy for profitable growth,” Kinnander says, pointing to a total of nine acquisitions made in 2022 for companies all over the world specialising in everything from wireless connectivity in mines and collision avoidance systems to rock drill manufacturers and excavator attachments. And that comes after the Swedish giant made eight acquisitions in 2021.
Certainly, since Epiroc was spun out of Swedish engineering group Atlas Copco in June 2018 with an estimated market cap of SEK120bn (US$14bn), the company has been unashamedly acquisitive, spending an estimated SEK3.5bn-SEK4.5bn (US$333m-$428m) on acquisitions in 2022 alone.
Like many construction and mining OEMs, Epiroc has been engaged in an acquisitions arms race, eager to benefit from a post-pandemic boom to buy up firms offering technology.
The goal is to make its machines more efficient, more environmentally sustainable and safer, as well as to gain market share in a market where skills shortages, inflation and supply chain issues have been causing bottlenecks.
For mining equipment manufacturers, like Epiroc, the race has become particularly intensified over the past couple of years because rising demand for commodities has prompted raw materials groups to expand their mines.
Many have started to search deeper underground for mineral deposits – and are opening up markets for technology which can enable them to mine at deeper levels more efficiently.
“We are growing organically but also through acquisitions,” Kinnander says. “They not only add to our revenues but bring us vital technologies and expertise in areas that we are focusing on, including automation, digitalisation, electrification, and the aftermarket. For us it is therefore natural to have more acquisitions than divestments.”
Epiroc’s latest purchase, announced on 13 December 2022, is CR, a 400-strong ground engaging tools provider headquartered in Australia, which produces cast lips, teeth and protective shrouds installed on mining buckets and loaders and whose digital solutions include a real-time GET loss detection system which last year produced revenues of AUS$240m ($164m).
“We focus our acquisitions on the niches that we operate in, which are hard rock mining, mining exploration, and civil engineering and construction,” Kinnander says.
“The acquired company should also be attractive from a growth and profitability point of view and have strong synergies and strategic fit with Epiroc, and they should also be able to have a leadership position within the niche.”
In fact, of the seventeen companies acquired by Epiroc over the last two years, around half produce specialist mining software of some kind, while the remainder mostly produce specialist machinery or electrification expertise.
“New and relevant technology – for example that they provide advanced connectivity solutions or electrification infrastructure – and the competent teams that come with the acquisitions can certainly also be strong factors for why we would be interested in acquiring a specific company,” Kinnander reveals.
And Epiroc is not alone. Caterpillar, Komatsu and Sandvik are just a few of the multinationals which have been on the acquisition trail as part of this new technology arms race.
Sandvik, which also specialises in manufacturing engineering and construction equipment, purchased nine new companies in 2022 and 14 the previous year.
“Shift to growth is a central part of our strategy with focus on organic growth as well as acquisitions,” a Sandvik spokesman says. “We have a strong balance sheet and good cashflow generation that allows for further investments.”
Sandvik points out that research and development traditionally forms a major part of its investment strategy while many of its recent acquisitions have been based around getting hold of cutting-edge digital technology and expanding the company’s expertise in the solid round tools sector.
”We focus on the digital shift where Sandvik enables companies in many industries to boost productivity and become more sustainable with digital solutions, from automated mines with self driving machines to factories where tool data and machining instructions are updated from the cloud,” the spokesman adds.
“Solid round tools is a fast growing segment in which we want to expand. The demand is driven by the transition towards lighter materials and requirements on high precision tools.”
Japanese manufacturer Komatsu announced in June 2022 that it had agreed to acquire Australia-based Mine Site Technologies, a company specialising in improving mining productivity through leveraging communication devices and position tracking systems.
Then, just six months later the company was back on the acquisition trail, buying underground mining specialist GHH Group from the German owned Schmidt Kranz Group.
And Caterpillar, the world’s largest supplier of both mining and construction equipment, too has been boosting its offering with a number of key acquisitions.
These include Australia-based Minetec which supplies high-precision tracking and data communications networks and software to improve productivity and safety.
They also, in May 2022, included US-based Tangent Energy, which uses Energy as a Service (Eaas) software to monitor customers’ energy use patterns and then come up with ways of dispatching resources to maximise return and monitise results without disrupting normal business operations – something which can be especially beneficial for customers with high peak energy demands such as mining operations and data centres.
And Caterpillar started 2023 announcing an investment in US-based battery technology company Lithos Energy, which produces lithium-ion battery packs.
Carl Gustaf Göransson, a former president of construction at CNH Industrial and managing director of Volvo Construction Equipment, who jointly runs off-road consultancy ABCG with Alan Berger, says current business conditions make expansion and diversification particularly attractive to OEMs.
“Throwing money at a problem can both add scale and competence fast,” he says.
“What comes in addition to this in CE [the construction equipment manufacturing industry] is the fact that we have a traditional business undergoing a large transformation in many areas. This includes new business models (e.g., power by the hour), technology, autonomy and the shift from internal combustion engines to electric power.”
Göransson describes the unprecedented pressures on OEMs to buy up tech firms as the “triple technology challenge,” with manufacturers rushing to add technology quickly in three key areas; connected products and automation, alternative fuels and disruptive business models.
Examples of recent acquisitions based around connected products and automation include Doosan Bobcat’s strategic equity investment in US-based startup radar technologies company Ainstein AI to develop hi-tec radar sensor systems for Bobcat equipment.
Deals featuring alternative fuels include CNH Industrial’s decision in April 2021 to take a minority stake in UK-based Bennamann, a company specialising in developing biogas and liquid biofuel from animal waste.
They also include Caterpillar’s 2021 investment in US-based CarbonPoint, a carbon capture specialist that provides technology to concentrate and capture CO2 which can then be either used or buried so that it is kept out of the Earth’s atmosphere.
Disruptive business model acquisitions include engine manufacturer Cummins’s move to invest in California-based asset management and software energy firm Exergy Energy as part of a plan to enable customers to switch to Cummins power systems solutions during outages.
It is not just traditional OEMs who are out to acquire construction tech specialists either. Construction tech firms themselves have also been highly acquisitive as they seek to buy up rivals and add technical know-how to their offerings while the asset class has also attracted venture capitalists and private equity investors.
Construction software giant Trimble’s recent acquisitions include US-based B2W Software in September 2022, France based Bilberry in August 2022 and US-based AgileAssets in December 2021.
Similarly, in September 2021, telematics specialist Trackunit announced it had acquired the Industrial IoT division of competitor ZTR.
Just a few months earlier Trackunit itself announced that software investor Hg had agreed to acquire a controlling interest in the company from Goldman Sachs and GRO Capital.
Michael Staebe, partner at Bain & Co points out that strong demand for tech firms means that they are reaching valuations far higher than similarly sized traditional manufacturing firms.
“Targets with attractive capabilities are highly valued,” he says. “Consider that tech assets trade, on average, at 25 times EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization] with high growth expectations vs. 13 times for targets in the industrial core (and acquirers’ own valuation).
“For example, Hitachi’s acquisition of digital engineering and design firm GlobalLogic at US$9.6 billion implies an EBITDA multiple of more than 37 times.
“Many companies are also taking a portfolio approach to developing these capabilities, through corporate venture capital, joint ventures, and partnerships.”
Moreover, Göransson cautions that the sheer scale of the emerging technology will limit the amount of tech specialisms OEMs can hold.
“The simple fact is that there isn’t enough bandwidth within even quite large OEMs to manage the manifold changes alone,” he says. “Certainly not with their current structure and set up both from a knowledge perspective.”
And, with rampant inflation, high interest rates and the War in Ukraine looking set to lead to a global recession in the coming months, the occupants of many company C-suites may be tempted to rein in their appetites for further acquisitions in 2023.
Yet Göransson predicts that appetite among OEMs for tech companies is so great that the rate of acquisitions is unlikely to slow down in 2023, despite a sluggish economy making business conditions increasingly difficult.
“Normally the appetite for new investments goes down during these times, however combining the extraordinary factors such as post covid, world economy under pressure alongside with the transformation in the industry, we are likely to see a further increase in M&A activities in the coming 12-24 months,” he says.
Back in Sweden, S&P forecasts that Epiroc’s acquisition spending could increase to SEK8bn-SEK10bn (US$761m-$952m) in 2023.
“We are constantly looking for strong and relevant companies to potentially add to the Epiroc family,” says Kinnander. “We are in a strong financial position, and we think and act long-term, so our strategy in this area is not really affected by a looming recession.”"
11 January 2023,Volvo CE’s new safety system,"Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has launched a Collision Mitigation System for its wheeled loaders, an automatic braking feature that supports operator response and helps reduce the risk of collision when working in reverse.
Volvo CE says that this is the first system of its kind from an original equipment manufacturer. It assists operators while working in reverse and automatically applies service brakes when the wheeled loader approaches any obstacle, alerting the operator to take further action.
It is estimated that wheeled loaders spend an average of 40-50% of their time being driven in reverse.
Volvo CE stated that this is not designed to replace safe operator behaviour but is a tool to enhance jobsite safety.
“We at Volvo CE continue to proactively develop intelligent solutions which not only mitigate the consequences of accidents but strive to avoid them altogether,” said Lars Eriksson, global product manager for wheel loaders at Volvo CE.
“This new Collision Mitigation System is one important part of our work to reduce the risk of accidents and help fulfil our commitment towards zero accidents.”
The system works by identifying when there is a risk of collision and responding by automatically activating the brakes for two-three seconds to slow the machine down prior to impact or bring it to a stop to avoid it. This initiation of the braking alerts the operator to intervene.
The system will remember the last slope the machine climbed, allowing operators to reverse down a pile without activating it. It can also be temporarily deactivated for specific site conditions.
Functioning only when the wheeled loader is in reverse and driving at speeds of between 3-15 km/h (1.86-9.32mp/h), no matter what gear it is in, it serves as a facilitator to jobsite safety.
Developed in-house by Volvo CE, the patent-pending Collision Mitigation System is a factory-fit option currently available on the L110H/L120H equipped with OptiShift, L150H, L180H, L220H, L260H and L200H High Lift wheel loaders.
Requiring a Radar Detect System to be fitted, it works as an additional system to the existing wide range of features, options and site services provided by Volvo CE for its line of wheeled loaders
The Collision Mitigation System will be available in all markets around the world."
26 December 2022,What were the top construction stories of 2022?,"Acquisitions, new product launches and the break out of war in Ukraine all come to mind when thinking back on the biggest stories in construction in this year.
This was the year that we started to see a prolonged period of recovery from Covid, while also meeting and overcoming new challenges. As we enter the final weeks of the year, Construction Europe looks at the top stories from construction in 2022.
The €8 billion Ellinkon smart city project by real estate firm Lamda Development took a significant step forward in August when the company opened The Ellinkon Experience Centre in Athens, Greece.
Designed to highlight the magnitude of the smart city project, said to be the largest urban regeneration undertaking anywhere in Europe, the interactive Centre has been built on the site of the former Athens International Airport.
Construction Europe published its list of the Top 100 construction companies in Europe 2022.
France-based Vinci once again came out on top, and extended the lead from second placed Bouygues’ Construction Divisions in the process.
Three of the top five companies on the list are France-based, while only one company managed to break in to the top 10 this year, Spanish firm Acciona.
US-based utility firm Ditch Witch unveiled what it claims to be the largest directional drill in the world at Bauma.
The AT120, which will enable users to drill long, large diameter bores, comes with a Stage V Cummins engine, 533.8 kN of thrust and pullback and 21,015 Nm of rotational torque.
Ditch Witch says the machine will be rolled out globally in the future, and is particularly ideal for pipeline, oil field, gas, sewer and water work.
The first Volvo Days event to take place since Covid saw the company reveal its 22 tonne electric excavator the EC230.
The battery-electric machine runs on four 66kW lithium-ion batteries, which are said to enable it to reduce running costs by up to 70% when compared with its diesel-powered version.
Although currently unavailable commercially, the EC230 is undergoing testing before it officially launches.
Rolls-Royce SMR and Škoda JS will collaborate on the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the Czech Republic and other parts of Central Europe after the respective companies signed a memorandum of understanding in September.
Rolls-Royce say the partnership will allow it to develop and deploy its own SMRs in the future, through the utilisation of ‘Škoda JS’ experience of producing pressurised water reactors,’ with which SMRs are based on.
At the beginning of the year, Saint-Gobain UK and Ireland announced details of the sale of three of its UK-based brands.
The company finalised the sale of the distribution businesses, Neville Lumb, DHS and Bassetts, which specialise in plumbing, heating and sanitaryware products.
The sale of the companies to Wolseley UK was finalised in March. Following the completion of the transaction, Saint-Gobain also announced the respective companies were finalising the sale of its Ideal Bathrooms subsidiary, which concluded in February.
Representing construction giant Caterpillar at Bauma was its German dealer Zeppelin, and at the trade show the company unveiled four elecrtric prototype machines.
These included the 20 tonne 320 medium electric excavator, 950 GC medium electric wheeled loader, 301.9 electric compact excavator and, 906 electric compact wheeled loader.
The machines are powered by Cat’s 48v, 300v and 600v lithium-ion batteries and, according to Product specialist Alan Davies, each model features on board charging capability.
The compact excavator and wheeled loader are expected to be launched in 2024, with no confirmation yet as to when the 950 GC and 320 will be available.
Global economic analysis specialist ING released its EU Construction Outlook report for 2022 in February, which revealed a projected output growth of 2.5% for the year.
The company said that its findings revealed that business confidence at the beginning of 2022 was positive, and despite rising costs and material shortages, the EU construction sector could expect growth in 2022 and 2023.
However, the report was carried out before the breakout of war in Russia, which has impacted the sector and as a result, ING published new findings in September to reflect this.
Having been delayed due to the pandemic, the aforementioned global trade show Bauma returned for the first time in three and a half years in Munich, Germany, in October.
Although visitor numbers were down on previous years, organiser Messe Munchen said nearly half a million visitors attended, with an array of construction equipment on show across the week-long event.
While there was plenty of diesel-powered machines on show at Bauma, this year saw electric machines take centre stage, with manufacturers keen to showcase the latest developments in environmentally-friendly machinery.
When war broke out in Ukraine in late February, the repercussions were felt around the world. An already fragile supply chain was further impacted by the events, while prices of oil and gas rocketed as the news broke.
This was, of course, felt by the construction sector, with manufacturers relying on materials and oil and gas from Russia.
The initial response from many within the sector was to condemn the actions of Russia,  and throughout the course of the next few weeks and months, companies such as Aggrekko, Dinolift, Hitachi Construction Machinery, Komatsu and JCB all ceased operations in Russia.
More recently, the EU confirmed it could seize €300 billion from the Russian Central Bank to rebuild Ukraine."
19 December 2022,How are OEMs meeting demand for complex engines?,"As there are increasing demands for improved emissions performance, fuel economy, and productivity, owners and operators of construction equipment are looking for solutions that can help them future proof their equipment.
Manufacturers across the globe are making significant advances in new and current technologies. Their focus has turned to the development of their systems as they strive to meet the changing needs of their customers and the industry that is moving towards a ‘greener’ future.
At the start of 2022, Cummins announced the next step on its journey to ‘Destination Zero’, with the launch of a fuel-agnostic internal combustion engine range.
Cummins says that the fuel-agnostic range offers different versions of the same base engine. The bottom ends of the engines look the same, but unique cylinder heads are designed to accommodate the use of a different low or zero carbon fuel – diesel, natural gas or hydrogen.
Each engine within the platform can run on one specific fuel; different from fuel-flexible engines that can run on multiple fuels.
This new approach is said to be implemented across Cummins’ B, L, and X-Series engine portfolios, initially in on-road applications but with off-highway use coming soon.
These different engine versions have a high degree of parts in common, which for OEMs means there is less need to alter machine design to accommodate different versions of the same engine family.
Cummins says that this gives OEMs the ability to develop natural gas or hydrogen-fuelled machines with the reliability, familiarity and integrability of a diesel internal combustion engine.
With these machines brought to market, operators have the freedom of choice to choose the right fuel for them, whether it is diesel, lower-emission natural gas or zero-emission hydrogen.
If they opt for hydrogen, then their fleets will be producing zero emissions from the exhaust of an internal combustion engine.
The company added that these new fuel-agnostic products form a significant part of their Destination Zero commitment, to find new ways of working, using fewer of the world’s resources whilst delivering reliable power solutions.
Also rapidly developing its engine technology is Deutz. Last year the company integrated the prototypes of the TCD 5.2 for customers in various applications with the goal of full production in 2022.
The TCD 5.2 has four cylinders and a displacement of 5.2 litres with a maximum output of 170 kW, and maximum torque of 950 Nm, the diesel engine is suitable for mobile machinery.
This makes the engine, which is meant as a replacement for larger six-cylinder engines, a compact drive in its power class.
The company says that they provide customers with drive solutions appropriate to their requirements, whether conventional or, increasingly, alternative solutions.
These include a mix of technologies ranging from diesel, alternative fuels, and hydrogen engines to e-fuels and electrification.
While alternative fuels continue to be a trending topic in the industry, Volvo Penta has been developing their engines to operate on lower fuel. Volvo Penta’s Stage V/Tier 4F D16 engine has been developed with a reduction of up to 10% in fuel consumption, low to high-end torque and high-altitude performance.
The Stage V D16 off-road engine from Volvo Penta has been designed to meet the needs of customers working in a range of environments, such as mining and construction.
The 16-litre engine features fuel efficiency, low to high-end torque and high-altitude performance.
On top of its low fuel consumption, the D16’s Exhaust Aftertreatment System (EATS) has been designed to use selective catalytic reduction technology only, removing the need for exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and a diesel particulate filter (DPF).
By incorporating water-cooled charged air, the D16’s dual-stage turbo system delivers high performance across the operational range, providing high torque at both low and high engine speeds.
This enables the engine to meet the requirements of multiple applications, without operators having to compromise between performance and torque.
John Deere Power Systems (JDPS) says that they are delivering new levels of reliability, durability, flexibility, and serviceability with its Next-Generation Industrial Engines.
In developing its Next-Gen Engine line up, JDPS consulted OEMs to learn more about what engine improvements were at the top of their lists.
They discovered that the solution was the ability to easily integrate John Deere power and performance into a wide array of heavy-duty applications— and the opportunity to offer engines that do not require operators to manage extra fluids, like Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).
John Deere Power Systems says its Next-Generation Engines offer simple maintenance so that operators can stay on the job longer.
They also provide operators with lower operating costs and meet both US and EPA Final Tier 4/Stage V emissions regulations.
Over at Briggs and Stratton, the company have been looking at an electronic system that controls the fuel delivery and the throttle for what is said to be smooth and efficient engine performance.
The Vanguard 400 EFI/ETC single-cylinder engine features Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) technology and is designed to withstand challenging conditions without a drop-off in performance.
Briggs and Stratton says it has a built-in Engine Control Module (ECM) that monitors and fine-tunes the engine.
Taking in signals from the engine sensors to make cycle-by-cycle decisions, the ECM determines how much fuel is needed and provides the spark for the EFI engine.
This results in smooth performance and improves users’ starting capabilities, whilst reducing fuel consumption during use due to more efficient fuel delivery.
It is clear that the changing demands of the industry are ensuring that diesel engine technology is kept up to date and consistently meets the needs of the modern-day job site."
14 December 2022,What climate pledges are being made in construction?,"With a couple of clicks of his computer keyboard, Marius Verwoerd, VP for Sustainability at Finnish mining equipment manufacturer Metso Outotec scrolls through a series of charts on the company website to show the carbon emissions.
In 2021, Metso produced 52,216 tonnes of carbon dioxide from its own operations, an increase of 14% from the 44,913 tonnes in 2020, but down 58% compared with 2019. This was mostly achieved, Verwoerd says, by switching energy sources from fossil fuels to renewables or renewable energy certificates where that isn’t possible.
That, he says, is keeping the company on track to meet its latest emissions reduction targets, set by the company in 2021, promising to halve CO2 output compared with 2019 levels and to ‘net zero’ by 2030.
Net zero is the point at which the amount of carbon emissions produced by the company will be so low it will be balanced out by the amount it removes from the atmosphere.
“Yes we are on track to reach our target,”Verwoerd says confidently. “We have quite a long history of setting climate related emissions targets in the company.
“We are also clear about what the next steps between now and 2030 will be. We have a company-wide roadmap for how we plan to achieve our target.”
And Metso is far from alone. More construction organisations than ever are signing up to ambitious climate pledges to reduce their carbon footprints as companies around the world face unprecedented pressure from customers, employees, shareholders and lenders to operate in a more environmentally sustainable manner.
An International Construction analysis of the sustainability reports produced by a selection of 50 of the world’s biggest contractors, construction equipment OEMs and rental companies, found that nearly all of them had made some sort of commitment to reducing emissions and improving their impact on the environment – see the box below for the full list.
Encouragingly, there are signs that these efforts are bearing fruit. Research from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), a UN-backed organisation which has become the gold standard in assessing corporate climate pledges, found that companies with approved targets collectively reduced direct emissions by 12% in 2020.
Even taking into account the effect of the Covid pandemic during this time, the organisation reported that SBTi companies have delivered “excess reductions in comparison to their peers within their countries.”
However, there are still big caveats.
At the COP27 climate change summit in Egypt this year, the UN climate science panel reported that global CO2 emissions are on track to increase by around 1% this year, making it even harder for the world to avoid disastrous levels of climate change.
Although much of the blame for this rests with world governments, the fact remains that many of the world’s biggest emitters have yet to sign up to a voluntary agreement.
Moreover, delegates heard that many of the corporate pledges which have been made are either not ambitious enough, or are not being implemented – leaving companies open to allegations of ‘greenwashing’.
“Despite [the] growing [number of] pledges of climate action, global emissions are at an all time high and they continue to rise,” UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres told the conference. “To avert a climate catastrophe, we need bold pledges but matched by concrete, measurable action.”
For a start, although many companies have pledged to cut emissions, fewer of these have agreed to become net zero within an agreed time frame. Of the 50 companies surveyed by International Construction, around half had published a specific commitment to become net zero. Moreover, there was a significant variation over the timescales by which the companies surveyed hoped to achieve net zero.
Just two – Metso Outotec and Canadian engineering company SNC Lavalin Group – stated an aim of becoming net zero by 2030. Swedish vehicle and equipment manufacturers Scania and Volvo Group, said that they aimed to become net zero by 2040, while another 15 explicitly said that they would become net zero by 2050 – the year by which the UN says global emissions must fall by almost 50% to keep global temperature rises to a 1.5ᵒC target.
A UN commission convened to assess the robustness of these corporate climate pledges, chaired by Catherine McKenna, a former Canadian minister of environment and climate change, found that even amongst those firms which had made a commitment to net zero, progress on emissions reduction was patchy and difficult to assess.
According to McKenna’s report, delivering on net zero requires three key measures.
Firstly, putting in place short, medium and long term plans to show how they will achieve their goal.
Secondly, focussing on reducing their own emissions as much as possible rather than buying carbon credits to offset their emissions.
Finally, addressing carbon emissions across their entire value chain – the ones produced by suppliers and customers – as well as the ones caused by their own operations.
“If you’re saying to the world ‘I am net zero’ then there is a price of admission,” McKenna told the conference. “You need to walk the talk. You need to deliver on it.”
One way in which many companies are attempting to put clear plans in place is by joining the SBTi, an initiative led by the UN Global Compact and involving a partnership of ‘green’ organisations and charities such as WWF, CDP and the World Resources Initiative.
The initiative works with businesses around the world to agree science-based target that limits a business’s global share of greenhouse gas emissions.
The initiative has quickly grown to become the gold standard for independently-verified corporate emissions targets with more than 4,000 businesses around the world already signed up, including 22 of those surveyed by International Construction.
Karl Downey, senior technical manager at the SBTi says that the organisation helps each individual company set meaningful emissions targets by assessing current emissions levels and plans to reduce them compared with those of industry peers.
Then, using a computer algorithm to work out how the proposed cuts would tie in with global emissions targets to keep warming to well below the 2ᵒC (or preferably 1.5ᵒC) above pre-industrial levels proposed in the Paris Climate Agreement.
Downey says that although the SBTi is unable to check whether companies are telling the truth about their emissions or sticking to their plans once they have set them, the initiative is important because it adds to the pressure corporates are facing to make meaningful changes to their operations.
“For the construction sector, the technology to enable companies to make these emissions cuts is already there,” Downey says. “The challenge we face is that the sector is so fragmented that we need to get lots of different individuals to each cut their emissions.”
Echoing McKenna’s second point, Downey says that the biggest problem his organisation comes up against in the construction sector when attempting to agree corporate climate pledges is the number of companies who propose that, rather than cutting their own carbon emissions, they plan to reduce their overall carbon footprint by investing in ventures such as renewable energy projects or tree planting - known as carbon offsets.
“We see a number of attempts at greenwashing but offsetting is definitely the biggest one,” Downey says.
“We are against using offsets as a way of meeting corporate targets, although we do say that of course companies can finance additional emissions reductions beyond their science-based target or net zero target.”
Some environmentalists go further, pointing out that tree planting events and the like have poor success rates and can even have a detrimental effect on the environments they are supposed to help.
“Carbon offsets mean climate sabotage,” Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International told the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021.
“They aren’t just a tool to greenwash climate inaction and delay the transformation we need, they’re also going to drive devastating land grabs in the Global South.”
Other ways companies attempt to manipulate their emissions targets, says SBTi’s Karl Downey, include choosing an atypical base year from which to measure their emissions reductions, or by attempting to make their emissions cuts sound bigger by calculating tonnes of CO2 emitted per US$1m of company sales.
“These figures can provide a useful way of looking at corporate emissions but overall we need to see total carbon emissions,” he says.
Claire Danamur, a sustainability analyst at ESG ratings agency EcoVadis, says that, although most large companies in the construction industry in Europe are capable of producing detailed and reliable information about the carbon emissions they produce through their own operations (scope 1 emissions) or the energy they buy from outside sources (scope 2).
Many face significant challenges when assessing scope 3 emissions - the greenhouse gasses produced by both the company’s suppliers and its customers. (In the case of equipment rental businesses, scope 3 emissions would include the carbon emitted by their machines when used by customers.)
“Some 20-50% of a building’s lifetime emissions take place during the construction phase,” Danamur says. “Every project is unique and involves a team of engineers, architects, consultants, suppliers and subcontractors that may not have worked together before.
“Furthermore, building materials are often sourced from global markets where labour and occupational health standards vary. This makes it challenging for global construction firms to account for all actors within their value chain.”
In the International Construction survey, only 20 of the 50 companies surveyed made any mention at all of scope 3 emissions at all in their climate pledges.
Downey says the SBTi is developing specific methodologies and guidance for some companies in the building sector which will require them to make greater scope 3 emissions cuts than average to account for a predicted 75% growth in the floor area of buildings between 2020 and 2050.
Back at Metso, Marius Verwoerd says that one of the ways his company aims to ensure it is working towards hitting its carbon reduction targets is by regularly publishing detailed data about a range of sustainability metrics including scope 1,2 and 3 emissions, the amount of water it uses and the amount of energy it consumes.
For president and CEO Pekka Vaurramo to receive his full share bonus in 2024, the Metso Outotec board has stipulated that one of the key performance metrics, carrying a weighting of 10%, is that the company must achieve its carbon emissions improvement target of reducing scope one and two CO2 output by 50% compared with 2019.
“In our company where sustainability is linked to our management’s renumeration and to our finance arrangements, as well as externally verified, we consider sustainability data as important as any other data in the company,” Verwoerd says.
“The more companies embed sustainability into their business models, and the more regulators ensure that regulations related to sustainability reporting push companies to be precise and open about their sustainability actions and data, the less likely ‘greenwashing’ will become.”
Yet with the wave of climate pledges made following the COP26 summit last year followed by a number of lawsuits about greenwashing in advertising campaigns, many firms are choosing not to publicise the details of their climate goals in an effort to avoid scrutiny and allegations of greenwashing.
A study of 1,200 companies by UK-based climate consultancy South Pole, found that although corporates are setting more net zero goals than ever before, with more science based goals to back them up and to more ambitious timelines, around a quarter said that they planned not to announce these targets to the public – a process it describes as ‘greenhushing.’
“More than ever we need the companies making progress on sustainability to inspire their peers and make a start,” says Renat Heuberger, CEO of South Pole. “This is impossible if progress is happening in silence.”
Critics also point out that the current voluntary system of emissions reporting and reduction includes no way to ensure that companies stick to the targets they have set themselves.
Even independent third party organisations like SBTi have faced criticism of potential conflicts of interest over the fact that they charge companies a $9,500 fee to assess their climate goals – funding which the SBTi’s Downey says makes up “only a small proportion of the organisation’s funding,” and about which it is “very transparent.”
“It’s tough to go and figure out who’s greenwashing and who’s not,” said Al Halvorsen, Vice President of ESG at Sunbelt Rentals, a subsidiary of the UK-based Ashtead Group, speaking at the Access, Lift & Handlers conference in Chicago, earlier this year. “There are companies that go out and set very aggressive goals, don’t reach their goal, and then five years later they set another aggressive goal.
“You look at the transparency of the company and if companies are honest in saying, ‘here are our challenges, here’s our performance’, and they don’t try to hide some of the faults that they have, I would say that would be a sign of somebody maybe who is not greenwashing. If you hear somebody making claims that they can’t or won’t back up – that would raise a flag to say, I wonder if that’s true or not.”
To combat this, the UN High Level Expert Group on Net Zero Emissions Commitments’ top recommendation is for governments around the world to introduce regulations and standards in areas including net zero pledges, transition plans and disclosures in order to ensure that companies are both consistent and transparent about their emissions.
“Voluntary schemes are not enough,” the UN’s Catherine McKenna said. “Regulation will be essential here, both to ensure that voluntary climate roadmaps are replaced by mandatory strategies and to level the playing field.
“If we are to avoid a future where our children are buying ‘net zero’ bacon between floods and fires, we must close the gap between the promises we hear and the action we need.”

13 December 2022,Video: construction’s path to net zero,"At the Trimble Dimensions event in Las Vegas, US, an expert panel from the construction industry discussed the issue of sustainability and the industry’s move towards a net-zero future.

12 December 2022,What are the stages of autonomy?,"Automation in construction is designed to produce higher production rates, improve project delivery times, as well as create better health and safety measures. A degree of automation – also known as machine control – has been in use in construction for decades.
Autonomous vehicles are operated by means of LiDAR sensors detecting obstacles in the surroundings, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and global positioning system (GPS) technology. This technology allows the vehicles to know their exact position on site, and a geofence is often used to prohibit the vehicles from operating off-site. A number of equipment manufacturers are including automation in the design of their vehicles, whilst construction technology companies are developing ways to enhance current fleets.
The human completely controls the equipment, be it a wheeled loader or an excavator. The human steers, brakes, and accelerates.
Under certain conditions, the machine controls either the steering or the vehicle speed, but not both simultaneously. At the same time, the operator performs all other aspects of driving and has full responsibility for monitoring the surrounding area and taking over if the assistance system fails to act appropriately.
Liebherr says that its new assistance systems for XPower large wheeled loaders increase comfort and safety in daily operation in a range of ways. The company says that one of its advantages is that they enable machine operators to concentrate more on operating their Liebherr wheel loader by removing additional distractions.
At this level, the machine can steer, accelerate and brake in certain circumstances. The operator will still need to perform tactical manoeuvres such as scanning for hazards.
The machine can manage most aspects of driving, including monitoring the environment. The system will request the operator to intervene when it encounters a scenario it can’t navigate, meaning the driver must still pay attention and be ready to take over at any time.
No human input or oversight is required except under select conditions defined by factors such as road type or geographic area (like poor weather or other unusual environments).
High automation allows companies to enhance safety in hazardous work environments, such as in the mining or quarrying industries, whilst also increasing productivity. Cat Command technologies by Caterpillar allow operators to use remote solutions, via onboard electronic and vision systems, to allow machines to be controlled without anyone in the cab.
The machine can operate on any road and in any conditions a human driver could negotiate. The system is navigated via an app or online system that will tell the machine what it should be doing. This level of automation is considered to be a long way off for construction.
In an interview with International Construction magazine, Trackunit CEO, Soeren Brogaard, said, “We are very far away from autonomous systems where AI can ultimately augment a human being… clearly, AI is coming. AI is an element that we all have to be part of. I think you’ll see it on expensive machines where each little component just starts getting more and more utility, so you cannot misuse it, or it cannot be of danger. But doing it at large construction sites with multiple systems; I wish it would happen in our lifetime, but I doubt it.”
To drive the development of autonomous transport solutions across the company, at the beginning of 2020, Volvo Group established the Volvo Autonomous Solutions business unit.
“Our approach is to start in a narrowly defined environment and build on the successes achieved there over time,” says Perjohan Rosdahl, Head of Off-Road at Volvo Autonomous Solutions. Rosdahl adds, “A perfect place for this is in quarries, which have clearly defined loading and unloading locations over generally short distances.”
The company’s autonomous and electrically powered load carrier TA15 uses GPS, lidar, radar and multiple sensors. Since the innovative vehicle does not require a driver, it comes without a cabin, enabling a completely new machine profile. According to Rosdahl, the next step could be the use of autonomous Volvo construction machines in underground mining and tunnels."
06 December 2022,Is net zero in construction possible?,"Is it possible to deliver a construction project without carbon emissions? The answer is no and, in all likelihood, it never will be.
What does this mean for construction, given Europe’s ambitious emissions targets?
In 2021, for example, the EU made history by establishing a new climate law, with net zero emissions by 2050 as a binding target.
It has been clear for at least seven years – since COP21 and the Paris Agreement – that drastic change is needed, and nowhere more than in the construction industry.
Victoria Burrows, director of the Advancing Net Zero programme with the World Green Building Council, says, “As a sector, we will be responsible for emissions; we cannot eliminate them completely – unless we stop building”.
What we can do is reduce emissions significantly, from the embodied carbon produced during the construction process.
To achieve this, Burrows believes “there is nothing less that we need than a complete transformation in the way that we build, design and operate buildings.”
She says, “The first principle of addressing emissions from embodied carbon is to prevent them in the first place…from the materials, the extraction processes of materials, the transport, the construction phase itself – everything up to the completion of the building.
Burrows adds, “We can prevent a lot of emissions by maximising the reuse of existing buildings through renovation.
“But when we do choose to build a new building, making sure that we’re reducing embodied carbon and those impacts, by optimising design techniques, such as offsite modular construction…
“But also thinking about construction sites [including] processes, electrification or reducing fossil fuel use on site. Also optimising materials selection for the building itself, through low-carbon material choices.”
Until recently those low-carbon materials were not easy to come by at a scale that could make a significant difference to the industry.
Add to that the high cost of using these newly-developed materials and newly-developed manufacturing processes, and it was difficult to see how they could really have an impact on overall construction emissions.
It would appear, however, that change is coming – and coming in the form of new low-carbon-cement technologies.
Given that cement is the world’s largest manufactured product by mass and is responsible for more than 7% of global carbon emissions, this could be very good news.
Recently, a number of companies have announced breakthroughs in cement technology, that promise significant carbon emissions reductions.
Ecocem says its new technology, known as ACT, results in the manufacture of a cost competitive and globally scalable solution, that can be produced within existing cement plants “without significant additional investment or modifications”.
Managing director of Ecocem, Donal O’Riain, said, “ACT arrives at a crucial moment and will rapidly accelerate our progress in reaching zero carbon cement.”
The launch of ACT coincides with a new report, commissioned by Ecocem, which indicates that without industry cooperation and the deployment of new scalable solutions at speed, reaching the goal of a 50% cut in emissions by 2030 is impossible.
Meanwhile, Ecocem’s current solutions are being used on a pilot site of France’s Grand Paris Express - one of Europe’s largest transport projects, where 50,000 tonnes of its ultra-low-carbon cement GGBS has been delivered for the construction of a tunnel.
The new material is expected to save some 34.5 tonnes of carbon emissions.
Similarly, Finnish materials company Betolar has introduced a low-carbon solution to the cement ‘problem’, which is called Geoprime and promises “safe and financially feasible low-carbon-solution construction materials”.
Much like the Ecocem product, Betolar’s solution promises minimal disruption to standard cement manufacture.
Janne Rauramo, Betolar’s head of EMEA, explains, “We create a roadmap together with the customer, then we do laboratory-scale testing according to the recipes of the customer and according to the application they are working on.
“After that, we do industrial-scale piloting and proof of concept…to show the solution actually works at their facility, with no changes required to the production process.
Rauramo adds, “When we talk about the recipe of the customer, we use their existing mix design as a starting point for our R&D work, then look at local available industrial side-streams or bi-products that we can use, then create the recipe with our chemicals to activate and get the necessary quality to the end product.”
Ultimately, Geoprime promises up to an 80% reduction in the carbon footprint, compared with standard cement.
It seems the technologies now being developed to ensure the scalability of low-carbon cement and cement alternatives, along with minimal disruption to current processes, have the potential to change the emissions outlook for construction.
The European Union has set out its Climate and Energy Framework for 2030, targeting a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
With this in mind, construction industry players are readying themselves for more stringent emissions regulations. But many can see the potential benefits – both to the planet and to business – of moving ahead of regulation, towards more sustainable construction methods.
Austrian contractor Strabag recently broke ground on a Circular Construction & Technology Center in Bremen, Germany.
The company says it is putting circular construction at the heart of its sustainability strategy and the new facility will be used as a testbed for preserving resources and avoiding carbon emissions.
The centre is to be built using sustainable methods of construction and with primarily climate-friendly building materials, such as wood and recycled concrete.
Strabag says the centre will be operated in an energy self-sufficient and climate neutral capacity, with power generated by photovoltaics and heat coming from a heat pump in combination with ground-level geothermal energy.
As construction firms begin to see the benefits of using ‘green’ methods, including offsite construction and digital technology, so we begin to see an acceleration of best practice and a subsequent reduction in emissions.
Industry bodies are recognising that exemplar projects and businesses will begin to reap the rewards of their higher ‘green’ profiles.
Chris Newman, zero carbon design manager at Mitsubishi Electric believes reaching net-zero carbon emissions is absolutely feasible, and is seeing progress being made in the construction industry across Europe.
He says, “Assessment methods such as BREEAM provide sustainability standards for the pan-European built environment.
“Green Building Council best practice guidance is shared across countries, and the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) is a European-wide carbon reduction strategy.
“As well as this pan-regional guidance, every country is also addressing its own priorities – which vary across the continent depending on factors unique to that region.
“For example, Spain has legislated that no public spaces can be cooled below 27°C in order to limit carbon emissions and energy consumption; France has included the impact of embodied carbon in its PEP ecopassports; and Scandinavia is running almost entire cities on district heating networks.”
At some point, however, we reach the limit of our current capacity to reduce emissions. When we reach this point, all we can do is offset the carbon we continue to emit.
Carbon offsetting has been disparaged by critics who say it is merely an opportunity to continue with ‘business as usual’ while appearing to achieve sustainability goals.
Victoria Burrows sees things differently. She says, “We see offsets as an important and significant part of the transition [to net zero].
“We believe that, if applied in the right way, offsets can have a positive impact on the sector.
“So, after you’ve achieved the maximum possible reductions, you should compensate for residual emissions.”

An area of Stockholm city centre in Sweden will use electric equipment from Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) as it becomes a testbed for emission-free construction equipment as work begins on its urban transformation.
The project contracts stipulate for fossil-free operations wherever possible, including transport to and from the construction site.
There was also a requirement that at least one of the larger excavators working on site should be electric – Volvo CE supplied the new 23-tonne EC230 Electric excavator, together with a mobile peak-shaving power unit.
The EC230 will help excavate 75,000 tons of rock and 96,000 tons of soil in the first stages of the project, for an estimated 2,700 working hours.
As Sweden’s largest fossil free worksite, it is set to save approximately 2,012 tons of CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 35 trucks driving about eight hours a day over one year. Volvo CE is working on the project with the City of Stockholm, construction company Skanska, Volvo CE dealer Swecon and other partners.
Construction is set to finish in 2033 when it will provide 3,000 new homes and 14,000 workplaces. In addition to the electric excavator, all other machines will be run on HVO.
Investment company Nordic Real Estate Partners (NREP) has revealed plans to build the world’s first net zero logistics facility in Bålsta, Sweden.
According to NREP, the building will achieve 100% carbon neutrality over the course of its lifecycle and across both operational and embodied carbon, without the need for carbon offsetting.
The firm says it will do this through means including the use of cross-laminated timber for the structure and facades, as well as organic insulation that binds more CO2 than it emits during the production process. Green cement, promising a 30% reduction from standard cement, will be used in the foundations of the facility.
Ultimately, the facility’s lifecycle carbon emissions will be reduced to net zero via a disassembly design principle, incorporating the reuse of its biogenic materials, including the timber structure.
From an operational perspective, the building will use 100% renewable green electricity, and NREP says it even has the potential to become “energy positive”, using solar, heat pump and battery storage solutions, that could send surplus energy back to the grid.
Claus Mathisen, CEO of NREP, said, “We have collaborated with the industry’s leading innovators to push new boundaries and deliver the world’s greenest logistics development.
“Drawing from the most advanced products available, this project will be a test bed for emerging solutions, creating a...commercially viable paradigm in carbon neutral real estate.”

24 November 2022,Construction testbed for ‘fossil-free’ contracting,"An area of Stockholm city centre in Sweden will use electric equipment from Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) as it becomes a testbed for emission-free construction equipment as work begins on its urban transformation.

Volvo CE is working on the project with the City of Stockholm, construction company Skanska, Volvo CE dealer Swecon, and other partners.
“Partnership is how we can accelerate our journey towards emission-free jobsites. We have powerful and reliable solutions like our EC230 Electric providing all the benefits of electric equipment: zero exhaust emissions, near silence and more comfortable operation,” said Fredrik Tjernström, responsible for Electromobility Solutions Sales at Volvo CE.
Insights from the EC230 Electric’s use will provide data on factors such as productivity, cost and scalability as well as prove useful for other partners in their ongoing ambitions to reduce climate impact through their work.
“We want to drive the development of fossil-free contracts, and we can do that by setting tender requirements in our procurements,” said Anders Österberg, deputy financial councillor and chairman of the exploitation committee in the City of Stockholm.
“In the contract, where large amounts of rock and soil are to be excavated, one of the requirements is that at least 10% of the machine hours must be powered by electricity.”


Construction is set to finish in 2033 when it will provide 3,000 new homes and 14,000 workplaces. In addition to the EC230 Electric, it is required that all other machines be run on HVO (hydrogenated vegetable oil) – a biofuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90%."
