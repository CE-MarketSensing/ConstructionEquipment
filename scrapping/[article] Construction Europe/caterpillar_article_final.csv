30 May 2023,World’s top ten construction OEMs revealed,"The latest Yellow Table, International Construction’s annual ranking of the world’s top 50 construction equipment manufacturers by sales figures, has revealed that sales for 2022 were US$230.6 billion, one of the highest figures ever recorded in the listing.
A large reason for this growth is the performance of manufacturers based in the US. OEMs based in the US accounted for over 26% of the total revenue of the Yellow Table, up from 21% in the last listing.
You can view the full Yellow Table in the latest issue of International Construction magazine with in-depth analysis.
The top ten biggest construction equipment manufacturers in the world for 2022 were:
10. JCB, UK
JCB enters the top ten for the first time in several years, with strong sales in the OEMs main market of India boosting its bottom line. The OEM is investing heavily into hydrogen technology.
9. Sandvik, Sweden
Another rise up the table for Sandvik – the company was at number ten last year. The company has been making numerous acquisitions, with the OEM making ten acquisitions in 2022, helping to explain their increased ranking.
8. Hitachi, Japan
Hitachi had construction equipment sales of US$9.2 billion, a steady increase from its final results last year. In 2022 the brand saw the ending of its joint venture with John Deere, with Hitachi Chairman Sonny Ishii saying at ConExpo that, “The Americas market is the single most important market, or priority, for Hitachi Construction Machinery.”
7. Liebherr, Germany
Liebherr saw good growth in 2022. In its own report it said that its construction and mining segments – earthmoving, material handling technology, deep foundation machines, mobile and crawler cranes, tower cranes, concrete technology and mining equipment – had an average increase in turnover of 6.9%. Liebherr says it is taking a technology-neutral approach to its research, which includes the increased use of hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVO), for potential use in construction equipment.
6.Volvo Construction Equipment
When adjusted for currency changes, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) had sales of US$9.9 billion keeping it in sixth place. The company is one of the leading OEMs when it comes to electric construction equipment, with one of the largest commercially available ranges including its new 23 ton battery electric excavator.
5. Sany, China
China-based Sany drop down one place in the table, from number four to number five. The Chinese construction market faced challenges in 2022 following on from two strong years so a general drop in China-based OEMs on the table was expected.
4. John Deere, US
US-based John Deere increased its ranking on the Yellow Table by one place, as it did in the previous Table. The company’s purchase of the Wirtgen Group has been a success and provided the company with access to new markets.
3. XCMG, China
Despite seeing sales fall, XCMG remains the world’s third largest OEM. As is the case with all major Chinese OEMs, the company is actively looking to increase its share of the international market and its most recent results showed record overseas sales. One of their leading executives believes that there is more growth to come in these markets.
2. Komatsu, Japan
Komatsu remains at number two on the list and has extended the gap between it and the rest of the table with sales that, when adjusted for currency, were similar to the last Yellow Table. The OEM recently announced the development of a medium-sized hydraulic excavator concept, powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The manufacturer said the machine’s development is in line with its aim to achieve carbon neutrality in construction equipment.
1. Caterpillar, US
Caterpillar retains its traditional position as the world’s biggest construction manufacturer with sales with sales of US$37.5 billion – approximately 16% of the total of the whole table. A senior executive at the OEM recently told International Construction about the OEMs plans regarding sustainability and new technology.

25 May 2023,Peri uses ‘innovative approach’ on tunnelling project,"On the A26 tunnelling project in Linz, Austria, the first fully hydraulic tunnel formwork carriage with a caterpillar drive in Austria was used.
The project aims to ease congestion on the country’s urban transport network. Tunnel construction work to the north and south of the Danube for the access and exit routes for the new Danube bridge has been in progress since May 2020.
A large section of the tunnel runs underground so that the noise and pollution in the urban area are reduced to an even greater extent.
Five different tunnel cross-sections, profile transitions, tight radii of between 50m and 750m in the bends, and varying gradients: these were just some of the challenges that had to be overcome when constructing the 1,600-m-long access tunnels for the new suspension bridge.
To help with the project Peri engineers developed Austria’s first customised and fully hydraulic special-purpose steel formwork carriage with caterpillar drive and a weight of 250t. This alone was enough to produce the different cross-sections in a total of 170 concreting sections.
Given the fact that the very tight curve radii made it difficult to transport the formwork carriage, an innovative caterpillar system was used to move it.
In addition, the formwork carriage had dimensions of 8.07m in height and 14.50m in length as well as 10.70m in width when ready to move and 11.20m in width when ready to pour concrete.
Peri assembled the formwork carriage in front of the tunnel entrance and, a short time later, the first concreting section was successfully completed, meaning that the formwork could be stripped the very next day and the formwork carriage moved forward to the next concreting section in an efficient and time-saving manner."
24 May 2023,"Interview: Caterpillar executive on electric power, automation and new equipment","ConExpo is North America’s largest construction trade show and Caterpillar, the world’s largest construction OEM, is headquartered in North America – I was expecting the Caterpillar stand at the show to be busy but, even so, the number of people was surprising. It was like being back on the London underground during rush hour, rubbing shoulder to shoulder with people.
I met Jason Conklin, senior vice president of Caterpillar with responsibility for Global Construction and Infrastructure, at the company’s stand, thankfully in a private room upstairs, where he was relaxed and accommodating, even offering to skip his lunch to give us more time to talk.
Conklin splits his time between his team, dealers and customers, and says that in his role he has travelled to more than 80 countries and all 50 States in the US. He says that the lack of skilled workers is, “the number one thing we hear from every single customer we talk to all around the world.”
The crowds at the Caterpillar stand are a reminder of the position that the company holds in the industry. They have consistently topped International Construction’s Yellow Table, the annual ranking of the world’s biggest OEMs by sales. When Caterpillar talks the industry takes notice, which is one of the reasons that the OEMs stance on alternative power – arguably the hot topic right now – is of such interest.
On this issue Conklin says, “We have to work all angles; we have to be there for the lithium-ion battery, we want to do research on hydrogen combustion, we’re looking into hydrogen fuel cells, but maybe most importantly, we’re making our current diesel machines more fuel efficient and more sustainable for the future.”
Regarding battery powered equipment, Caterpillar announced last year four electric prototypes – the 301.9 mini excavator, 906 compact wheeled loader, 320 medium excavator and a 950 GC medium wheeled loader. All run with lithium-ion batteries. Regarding electric power specifically, Conklin says that Caterpillar, “definitely see government requirements coming to potentially incentivize its adoption.”
How to make construction more sustainable
As Conklin says, Caterpillar – and indeed all major OEMs – need to “work all angles” when it comes to alternative power sources as no OEM or engine manufacturer can confidently say exactly what the future will look like.
One thing that Conklin is keen to point out though is how much cleaner and sustainable diesel equipment is now, and how that journey is ongoing. The company is committed to ensuring that every new product it introduces is more sustainable than the machine it replaces.
“If we’re able in some cases to improve our fuel efficiency, reduce our fuel burn by 35% versus machines ten years ago, that means less carbon,” says Conklin. “Our view is that diesel equipment also needs to be more and more sustainable. We’re proud of what we’ve done to increase our fuel efficiency.”
Caterpillar has gone public with its sustainability goals – the company says that it is committed to a 30% reduction by 2030 in terms of absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that it produces in operations. Conklin calls this a “pretty bold goal” but says that, since 2006, Caterpillar has already reduced GHG emissions in its operations by around 50%.
One of the ways that GHG can be reduced is through increased productivity and efficiency and a key way to achieve this is through technology. Caterpillar has introduced a new version of VisionLink that brings together multiple legacy solutions that were built on different platforms with fragmented interfaces. The OEM says that it has consolidated those capabilities into a single solution that is scalable for customers of all sizes and available in both a desktop and mobile experience.
VisionLink allows users to access their data, manage their fleets, schedule tasks and provides key metrics, location of assets, fuel level, idle time and more. It also, crucially, allows its users to manage equipment and attachments, regardless of their brand.
“It’s full fleet. We started out originally thinking that VisionLink would be more of a Caterpillar application for Cat assets,” reveals Conklin. “But the more we talked to customers, they said ‘wait a second, I’ve got multiple trucks, attachments, I’ve got competitive iron.’ We want to make sure that VisionLink can meet all those needs.”
Platforms such as VisionLink will certainly play a key role in construction’s sustainability journey, as will automation. Construction is relatively early on its path to autonomy and is certainly behind mining.
“We’ve been on a long journey with mining – in fact, our machines have moved over 5.5 billion metric tons autonomously. And we’ve done that across 25 mine sites. What we’re most proud of – of course we’re helping improve productivity – is we’ve done it without injury from autonomy,” says Conklin. “That tells you about the power of autonomy; it helps your safety, it helps your productivity.”
Autonomy in the construction industry
Caterpillar is closely collaborating with Luck Stone, the US’s largest family-owned and operated producer of crushed stone, sand and gravel, to deploy Caterpillar’s autonomous solution to its Bull Run plant in Virginia, US. This will be Caterpillar’s first autonomous deployment in the aggregates industry and Conklin says that the partnership will deepen their understanding of autonomy operations for sites with fewer mobile assets and inform scaling the technology into construction.
“This project allows us to accelerate our learning and brings what we’ve learned from mining down into the quarries. From there, we see applications such as paving being a logical next step, automating machines like soil compactors, asphalt compactors.”
Conklin says that there is a “long road to autonomy” but that the potential is there. “We start by making some features in our machines autonomous. And then we go to a Cat Command remote control solution where the operator’s actually off the equipment but running it.
“Then there’s full autonomy, which some customers are ready for, and some aren’t, but we certainly have the experience to leverage it when the industry’s ready.”"
18 May 2023,Digging with a twist: What are the advantages of a tiltrotator?,"Popular in Scandinavia, and growing in other areas of Europe, the tiltrotator is deemed to significantly increase machine efficiency.
The tiltrotator can look like a confusing bit of kit but it is possible to think of it as a wrist that directly connects to the excavator’s arm or beneath the excavator’s quick hitch. The tiltrotator is then connected to the excavator’s hydraulics and electrical system. Depending on the excavator’s extra hydraulics, control is adapted to suit different types of control system.
In the early 1980s, the Norgrens family introduced the Tiltrotator to the Swedish market under their family-owned and operated company Noreco, and since then it has become a standard in the Scandinavian region. The concept has also recently gained popularity in many other countries across the globe, including the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and the United States.
Sven-Roger Ekström, senior product manager at Rototilt, understands the capabilities of tiltrotators better than most and believes that they have several benefits that could change the way we work on construction sites.
Upon asking Ekström why everyone should have a tiltrotator, he reels off a list of what he believes are the key advantages. “Your excavator becomes an efficient tool carrier in addition to working faster and more flexibly with fewer machine movements.”
Ekström adds that such qualities allow companies to take on new types of jobs and will require less manual labour around the machine.
Unfortunately, the skills shortage is as much a concern as it was in 2022 and including a new attachment into the field can cause apprehension for potential buyers, who may be uncertain about imposing such a complex attachment on operators.
Ekström, however, says it takes only a short time to become proficient with a tiltrotator. “If you are a skilled excavator operator you will need 1-2 weeks to perform really well. After that first jumpstart, you will start to see new opportunities such as how to solve working tasks in a new way and become even more efficient.”
Stefan Stockhaus, CEO of Steelwrist, believes that tiltrotators are also the answer to increasing safety in potentially dangerous working conditions. By using tiltrotators, jobs traditionally done outside the cabin can be moved into the cabin, removing ground workers from risk-prone roles. “It’s not all about efficiency,” he says. “It’s also about safety and becomes an alternative to a standard factor.”
Increasing efficiency is undoubtedly a huge advantage on the modern-day construction site and Ekström says tiltrotators can increase efficiency by 25% to 30% depending on the type of job. “On some jobs where you, with the combination excavator plus tiltrotator, can do the same job as two or three standard excavators you of course calculate with even higher figures,” he adds.
Steelwrist’s Stockhaus agrees with Rototilt’s Ekström regarding his sentiments on the tiltrotators ability to increase efficiency, but he adds that enjoyment is also a benefit. “In our case, 96% of all the experienced users say that the job is more fun. And if the job is more fun, it’s easier to attract good employees. Those are two really strong cases. As I see it anyway – efficiency, profitability, but also more fun.”
Mature markets, such as Scandinavia, have embraced the adoption of tiltrotators. Almost 90% of excavators in the region have the attachment, which is said to be crucial to winning projects as well as meeting specific sustainability goals.
While Scandinavia has fully adopted this form of attachment, the rest of Europe is somewhat slower. “It always take time to break new ground and to change old habits,” says Ekström.
“In Scandinavia, we have a long practice of getting more efficient because of expensive, and the lack of manual labour. We also have a market with many small contractors that often see the owner in the cab working with the equipment; therefore, he can quickly see the benefit of working in a new way.”
Stockhaus believes the popularity surrounding tiltrotators in Scandinavia comes from the region’s pressure on increased productivity – it is also the key to getting jobs.
Elsewhere in Europe, Ekström says that big companies with a large rental market often take longer to see the benefits. Other obstacles, he says, can be that as long as the contractors are satisfied with buying two or three machines instead of one machine with a tiltrotator, the dealers will not push the product until the customer asks for it.
Autumn 2022 saw Rototilt launch its Rototilt Control product concept featuring tiltrotators, joysticks, a new control system and a remote support app. The product has become well established in the market and companies are starting to realise their potential – Rototilt are now expanding the number of tiltrotators in their RC series.
The company confirmed that Rototilt’s R4 and R8 tiltrotators will gain counterparts in the RC series launched at Bauma last year. This means that Rototilt’s new RC System control system and the new RC Joysticks will be available to machines weighing between 10 and 43 tonnes.
The R4 tiltrotator has historically been one of Rototilt’s most popular products, according to Ekström, who has high expectations ahead of the sales launch.
He says, “We started in the mid-range but are now expanding the concept to encompass both bigger and small machines. Today we are delighted to offer increased energy efficiency and an improved driving experience for a wider range of machines and users.”
The new tiltrotator series, due to launch in February 2023, features pressure-compensated hydraulics and is said to deliver greater energy efficiency than its predecessors, in addition to enabling more controlled excavation movements.
As part of a joint initiative, Steelwrist and Rototilt have come together to set an industry standard for fully automated quick couplers under the Open-S Alliance. The non-profit organisation sets out to develop and promote the Open-S standard, with the ultimate aim of achieving global interchangeability between quick couplers, tiltrotators and work tools for excavators.
The alliance’s standardisation work has been ongoing for the last two years with the purpose to increase safety and efficiency for excavator owners, operators and ground personnel.
The partnership has started to create a uniform manufacturing standard for dimensions and tolerances as well as making it cost efficient to retrofit adaptor brackets to used and new buckets and work tools.
In 2021, Volvo Construction Equipment became the first excavator specialist to join the alliance in hopes to work with other industry partners on improving work tools for excavators. The demand for fully automatic quick couplers on excavators has continued to grow rapidly in general construction and it is said that all partners are seeing opportunities for growth in a variety of sectors.
Steelwrist and Rototilt are paving the way for the future of tiltrotators, in addition to the likes of Volvo Construction Equipment and Caterpillar. Scandinavia needs no convincing evidence of the advantages of tiltrotators and it seems the rest of Europe is taking a particular interest in increasing efficiency.
Last year, Caterpillar Work Tools Division announced new Tilt Rotate System (TRS) models for Cat 302.7 through 310 Next Generation Mini Excavators.
The new TRS4 and TRS8 S45 plus updated TRS6 models allow attached work tools to rotate 360 degrees and tilt 40 degrees side-to-side. This enables the machine to reach more work areas from a single position, while manoeuvring tools over, under, and around obstructions when excavating, grading ditches, sorting recycled materials, or placing pipe.
The new TRS models are said to multiply the mini excavator’s versatility and are available in various configurations to match the application.
The TRS6 and TRS8 feature a standard TRSAux2 auxiliary port at the bottom to connect a variety for different hydraulic tools whilst the compact design of the TRS4, TRS6 and TRS8 allows the mini excavator to maintain high digging forces.
TRS4 models are designed for efficient use by the 302.7, 303, 303.5 and 304 Mini Excavators, while the TRS6 models are compatible with the 305.5CR and 306 CR models. The TRS8 models are designed for use with the 307.5, 308, 308.5, 309 and 310.
Engcon is seeing “stable profitability” after reporting record-high net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022.
While the last three months of 2022 saw the company’s order intake decline by 29% SEK553 million (€49.4 million), its net sales increased to SEK541 million (€48.3 million).
This is up 46% on the SEK370 million (€33 million) the company brought in for the same period in 2021 - with operating profits also up 57% on the previous year to SEK 121 million (€10.8 million).
Overall, this resulted in a fourth quarter profit rise of 20%, to SEK 90 million ($8.6 million), up from SEK75 million (€6.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Engcon’s fourth quarter results meant that for the whole of 2022 the company saw an order intake rise of 1%, up from SEK1.96 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.97 billion (€171.4 million).
2022 net sales also increased by 30%, from SEK1.48 billion (€131.9 million) in 2021 to SEK1.93 billion ($186 million), with profits last year amounting to SEK325 million (€29.6 million) - a rise of 21%.
Krister Blomgren, Engcon’s CEO, said, “Combined with increased economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rates, this led to an expected downturn in Nordic and European markets in the fourth quarter compared with exceptional comparative figures. Despite this, the order intake was at a high level when seen from a long-term perspective.
“It is worth noting that there was a break in the trend in 2022, with growth markets recording higher order intake than the Nordic region for the first time.”
Looking to the future, Engcon plans to continue investing in its third generation tiltrotator system and expand its sales network.

09 May 2023,Triangle Tyre increases European focus,"The China-based manufacturer’s current range of radial tyres covers up to the 1600mm rim, which is the largest size in the world for the off-the-road (OTR) segment, suitable for rigid dump trucks operating in the mining sector, with load capacities of up to 360 tonnes.
New products from Triangle include the TL559S+ L5 *** L5 in the sizes 20.5R25 and 23.5R25, designed for wheeled loaders in both surface and underground mines.
The company said the new tyres allow for bigger loads than the previous 2-star load index version and offer higher resistance to impact, more wear, and maximum load capacity.
In the rigid dump truck segment, Triangle has introduced the TB577A Super *** E4, with increased tread depth, designed for medium dump trucks with 55-60 tonnes load capacity.
The crane tyre segment has seen the introduction of the new 445/95R25 TB576 174F E2, developed with a lighter construction to improve the efficiency of use on mobile cranes and achieve better fuel efficiency.
In the articulated dump trucks segment, Triangle has also enlarged the range of its TB598S E4 tyres with the size 875/65R29.
Luca Mai, Triangle’s OTR director for Europe, said the company’s continuous development of relationships with leading earthmoving equipment manufacturers had helped it achieve positive results in terms of products and performance, including numerous Caterpillar Platinum Awards.
He added that feedback from customers had led the company to expand its range, saying it was now “one of the most complete and performing at the highest level in the earthmoving tyre market”."
03 May 2023,Digital construction site steals show on Samoter’s first day,"




Machine control, remote control, autonomy and collision avoidance technology worked together with machines from the likes of Develon, Kobelco and Komatsu, to give the audience a vision of what tomorrow’s construction sites may look like.
Topcon and Leica positioning technology was on show, as well as Trimble’s augmented reality solution, SiteVision.
Caterpillar’s Cat Command System was utilised to demonstrate applications as diverse as the remote control loading of a hauler and the remote removal of an explosive device discovered during excavation.
The show demonstrated the advances that have been made in the area of machine control, as a Komatsu dozer made short work of grading, with the operator a passive observer.
Later, a 23-tonne Develon excavator demonstrated the delicate operations that can now be undertaken using the latest tiltrotator attachments from Engcon and Steelwrist.
Construction’s significance
Earlier, the show, which is running in conjunction with the paving and road infrastructure equipment fair, Asphaltica, opened with with speeches from regional mayors and government ministers, who stressed construction’s importance to Italy, as a vital component of its economic recovery.
Italy’s minister of infrastructure and transport, Matteo Salvini, described the importance of infrastructure developments, mentioning the proposed bridge across the Strait of Messina, which, after many years of debate, is potentially now set to connect the island of Sicily with the mainland.
Samoter’s organisers said the show’s six halls and three outdoor areas will host 536 companies from 23 nations over the course of the week, who will vie for the attention of buyers from more than 100 countries.
Alongside equipment and solutions exhibits, Samoter will also host more than 80 market and technical conferences and workshops."
02 May 2023,7 things we learned from Caterpillar’s latest trading update,"

Last week saw Caterpillar unveil a strong performance for the first quarter of 2023, driven in large part by growth in North America.
Sales in its construction industries division increased by 10% to US$6.7 billion, while operating margin in the segment was 26.5%.
Here’s seven things we learned about Caterpillar’s performance, what it says about the wider construction industry, and where it could be heading:

Caterpillar reported better equipment availability thanks to improving supply chain conditions. But “pockets of challenge” still remain, particularly for large engines which could impact some of its larger machines.
In general, the supply chain improvements meant that Caterpillar was able to make stronger-than-expected shipments in North America, which is Caterpillar’s most constrained region as far as dealer inventory is concerned.
Caterpillar noted that there is now improved availability of its excavators. That has come about as a result not just of the lower pressure on supply chains but also because of a slowing of demand in China.
Caterpillar said it expected China’s above 10t excavator industry to remain below 2022 levels this year due to low construction activity, while its sales in China would be below the typical range of 5-10% of total Caterpillar sales in 2023.
The better availability of some types of machine in turn means that Caterpillar expects dealers to scale back their levels of inventory in the second half of the year, even though overall demand remains healthy.
The second half of 2022 saw dealers build their inventories to the tune of $1.4 billion. Talking to analysts, Caterpillar chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby said, “We are not planning for this trend to repeat [in the second half of 2023]. Instead, we expect to see dealers decrease inventories compared to the first quarter levels and end 2023 about flat relative to the end of 2022.”
Caterpillar’s overall adjusted operating profit margin for the period was 21.1% and hit 26.5% in the construction industries division. In a call with analysts, chief financial officer Andrew Bonfield explained that while Cat’s manufacturing costs did increase, they increased by less than the company anticipated.
Better-than-expected sales volumes meant factories could operate more efficiently, while freight costs were also lower. Meanwhile, the average price Caterpillar was able to charge for machines was higher than it had expected. These factors combined to boost the company’s profit margins.
But Bonfield said he did not expect the favourable effects of absorbing costs to last in the second half of the year, with margins in the remaining quarters of the year expected to be lower than the first quarter as the relationship between price and manufacturing costs normalized.
The US government has pledged to pump billions of dollars into infrastructure investments through measures such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BiL), which it is claimed involves up to $550 billion in new spending.
Umpleby confirmed that Caterpillar had started to see the positive impact of those infrastructure dollars in orders.
Speaking to analysts, he said, “The projects that don’t require a lot of permitting, things like resurfacing roads, have already started and we’re seeing the positive benefit of that.
“When customers believe there’s a pipeline of projects coming, they’re more likely typically to make that capital investment, to make a purchase of a new piece of equipment. It has started and we expect it to continue for some time.”
Caterpillar said it expected business activity in Europe, Middle East and Africa to increase in 2023 as compared to 2022. While that was down in large part to particularly strong construction demand in the Middle East, and while uncertain economic conditions remain, the company noted that European construction was “more resilient than we previously anticipated”.
When it came to mining equipment, Umpleby said he expected healthy demand, driven by the transition to new forms of energy. He noted that commodity prices remain above investment thresholds and said he expected production utilization levels to remain elevated.
He added, “We also expect the aging of the fleet and a lower level of parked trucks to support future demand for our equipment and services. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for profitable growth.”

27 April 2023,North America drives Q1 rise for Caterpillar,"Caterpillar has announced first-quarter 2023 sales and revenues of US$6.7 billion for its construction industries section, an increase of US$631 million, or 10%, compared with US$6.115 billion in the first quarter of 2022.
The North America region drove a lot of this growth, with sales increasing by 33% from the first quarter of 2022 to US$3.6 billion.
Another region that saw growth was EAME (Europe, Middle East and Africa) albeit with a much smaller increase of 5%, taking sales in the region to US$1.3 billion.
Sales dropped in Asia Pacific by 21% to US$1.1 billion with Caterpillar putting this down to “lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impacts, primarily related to the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.” Cat said that in addition to lower sales to end users, dealers inventories in the region increased less than in the same quarter in 2022.
Latin America also saw sales drop, by 4% to US$599 million.
Construction Industries’ profit was US$1.790 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of US$733 million, or 69%, compared with US$1.057 billion in the first quarter of 2022.
“I’d like to thank our global team for their strong operational performance while serving healthy demand during the first quarter. We achieved double-digit top-line growth and record adjusted profit per share while generating strong ME&T free cash flow,” said Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO.
Caterpillar’s Resource Industries’ total sales (which includes mining equipment) were US$3.427 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $597 million, or 21%, compared with US$2.830 billion in the first quarter of 2022.
All regions reported a growth in sales for this segment: North America by 28%, Latin America was up 19%, EAMA by 1% and Asia Pacific saw a 31% increase.
The May-June issue of International Construction will include the Yellow Table, a ranking of the world’s biggest construction OEMs by sales. Previous editions of the Yellow Table can be viewed online."
21 April 2023,Simem celebrates 60 years of concrete plants,"
Like many other small and medium manufacturing companies in this area, Simem was founded by the intuition of a single entrepreneur, Piero Furlani, who started with the production of cement mixers with reversing drums.
In the 60 years since, the management of the company has been passed on to his two sons: Federico, now president, and Michele, managing director. Together they now manage an international enterprise which can be counted among the top players in the market for concrete plants worldwide.
Simem has supplied its plants to many key construction projects around the world, including the Panama Canal expansion, Hong Kong airport, the EuroTunnel beneath the English Channel, the Petronas Tower in Malaysia, the Olympic Stadium in Sydney and the Brenner Base Tunnel, currently under construction beneath the Alps.
Simem employs 250 people at its Italian headquarters and in several subsidiaries located in its major markets of Canada, United States, India and, more recently, in Germany. The company has also opened its second production plant in India, from where it serves areas in the Middle East and Asia.
In other countries, Simem has distribution agreements with companies representing well-known OEMs such as Caterpillar and John Deere.
Constructon 4.0
The expansion into international markets got a major boost in 2016, when Simem acquired two companies that are now fully integrated in the group: Simem Underground in Canada, that produces technologies for underground construction; and Simem Spil in Treviso, Italy – a specialist in automated systems for concrete precast.
According to the the company’s president, Federico Furlani, the construction market is going through a fourth industrial revolution, driven by digital transformation and by Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG).
He says, “Digital and ESG are new directions the whole industry is embracing, and Simem is fully committed since quite some time to anticipate the opportunities that these changes will bring to the concrete market.
“We are confident that the next 60 years will bring even more growth to our company.”
Partnerships are key
Simem recently celebrated its 60th anniversary at its Italian headquarters, hosting a gathering of partners, customers, and experts from the construction industry.
Santo Accogli, executive assistant director of plant & equipment at Webuild Group, celebrated the cooperation between his company and Simem spanning over 15 years, in which WeBuild utilised approximately 30 million m3 of conventional concrete and roller-compacted concrete (RCC) produced by Simem.
He reminded guests at the anniversary celebration of some of the projects his company had realised with the contribution of Simem, including the Panama Canal expansion, for which Webuild used two Simem RCC plants.
Another example was the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Project (GERDP) – a huge (and fully Italian) construction project, realised with RCC produced in Simem plants.
According to Accogli, the building site reached a production of almost 12 million m3 of concrete, with a maximum peak of 1,450 m3 per hour.
Federico Furlani believes the company’s growth and success derive from the work of all the employees who strive every day to imagine, design and build some of the world’s biggest concrete plants.
He says, “Among the projects in the works right now, we have a large 3D printer for dam construction, a system for CO2 sequestration from concrete (using wood chips and lime), and a digital platform that will integrate BIM, IoT and Blockchain.”
With this combination of digital technology and a sustainability ethic, the future for Simem would appear to be bright…and green."
20 April 2023,60 years building concrete plants,"


Simem is a family-owned manufacturer of concrete plants, located since 1963 in the Verona province, Italy.
Like many other small and medium manufacturing companies in this area, Simem was founded by the intuition of one single entrepreneur, Piero Furlani, who started with the production of cement mixers with reversing drums.
In the 60 years since, the management of the company has been passed on to the two sons: Federico, now president, and Michele, managing director. Together they now manage an international enterprise which can be counted among the top players in the market for concrete plants worldwide.
Simem has supplied its plants to many key construction projects around the world, among others the Panama Canal expansion, the Hong Kong airport, the EuroTunnel under the English Channel, the Petronas Tower in Malaysia, the Olympic Stadium in Sydney, and until the Brenner Base Tunnel currently under construction.
Simem employs 250 people in the Italian headquarters and in several subsidiaries located in its major markets: Canada, United States, India, and more recently in Germany. The company has also opened its second production plant in India from where it serves areas in the Middle East and Asia.
In other countries, Simem has distribution agreements with company that represents well-known OEMs as Caterpillar and John Deere.
The expansion into international markets got a major boost in 2016 when Simem acquired two companies that are now fully integrated in the group: Simem Underground in Canada that produces technologies for underground construction, and Simem Spil in Treviso, Italy: a specialist in automated systems for concrete precast.

According to the President, Federico Furlani, the construction market is going through a fourth industrial revolution which is driven by digital transformation and by Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG): “Digital and ESG are new directions the whole industry is embracing, and Simem is fully committed since quite some time to anticipate the opportunities that these changes will bring to the concrete market. We are confident that the next 60 years will bring even more growth to our company.”
Simem celebrated its 60th anniversary at the Italian headquarter, hosting a gathering of partners, customers, and experts from the construction industry.
Santo Accogli, GSC Pl&Eq - Plants Dept Head, Senior Manager at Webuild Group, celebrated the cooperation between his company and Simem spanning over 15 years, in which WeBuild utilized about 30 million cubic meter of conventional concrete and roller-compacted concrete (RCC) produced by Simem.
He reminded to the guests at the anniversary celebration some of the projects his company realized with the contribution of Simem, as for example the Panama Canal expansion where Webuild used two Simem RCC plants.
Another project is the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Project (GERDP): a fully Italian, gigantic project realized with RCC produced in plants by Simem. The building site reached a production of almost 12 million m3 of concrete, with a maximum peak of 1,450 m3 per hour.
Federico Furlani said that the company’s growth and success derive from the work of all the employees who strive every day to imagine, design and build some of the world’s biggest concrete plants. “Among the projects in the works right now, we have a large 3D printer for dam construction, a system for CO2 sequestration from concrete (using wood chips and lime), and a digital platform that will integrate BIM, IoT and Blockchain.”"
19 April 2023,Small but mighty: The role of mini and midi excavators in modern projects,"Many manufacturers in the construction industry, certainly the larger ones, have expansive product ranges. One of the reasons for this is financial – the more products a company can sell and service the more money can be made – but another one is simple necessity; construction is such a broad industry that it requires a wide selection of equipment.
Out of all the equipment that is used in construction it is difficult to think of one that has grown in popularity quite as quickly as compact excavators such as the mini excavator (machines approximately 0-6 tonnes) and the midi (approximately 6-10 tonnes).
“The first mini excavators were produced in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a tool of necessity in the country’s famously dense and crowded cities,” explains Chris Sleight, managing director, Off-Highway Research. “By the 1980s they were being exported to Europe and North America, but it was not until the early 1990s when Japanese asset prices collapsed and the economy stagnated that these overseas markets became much more important to the sector’s (still predominantly) Japanese suppliers.”
By the late 1990s, Europe had overtaken Japan as the world’s largest mini excavator market, while demand in North America was matching that of Japan by the mid-2000s. However, it was not until around 15 years ago that the popularity of mini excavators became truly established.
“The previous peak in sales was in 2007, just prior to the impacts of the Lehman Bros. collapse and global economic crisis. That year saw just under 185,000 mini excavators sold worldwide. Fast forward to 2021, the latest peak in the mini excavator cycle, and more than 325,000 units were sold,” says Sleight.
Two key factors have driven this growth: compact excavators have increasingly replaced traditional machine types like the backhoe loader in Europe and North America thanks to the attraction of a smaller footprint, full 360-degree slewing and lower prices than backhoe loaders; they have also started to sell in significant numbers in emerging countries. The most notable has been China, where the mini excavator market peaked at more than 100,000 machines sold in 2020.
Timur Abied, utility product manager at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) tells International Construction that mini and midi excavators are among the OEMs fastest growing product segments with more efficient governance of energy being a main driver.
This sentiment is backed up by Cédric Durand, product management director EMEA, Yanmar Compact Equipment, who says that mini and midi excavators have been growing strongly over the past years.
He adds that, “From one year to another the growth can differ from one country to the other but almost all countries had a strong growth.”
Another smaller factor – but still important – behind the growth in the popularity of these machines is the increased use of attachments such as tiltrotators. “The growing popularity of tiltrotators has been a gamechanger for compact excavators, as tiltrotators allow an excavator operator to tilt and twirl an attachment 360 degrees,” says David Caldwell, national product manager, Takeuchi-US.
New technology is increasingly being integrated into mini and midi excavators, often from what was originally reserved for larger models. Stephane Dieu, excavators product manager, Europe, Develon (previously Doosan), says that, “With the arrival of our DX-7 range, all of the new mini excavators in the range are now equipped with our DoosanConnect telematics system, which was restricted in the past to only our medium and heavy segments – 14 tonne and over in the excavators. This gives our customers the opportunity to fully monitor their compact fleet.”
Chris Bardas, product manager, Hitachi Construction Machinery, reveals that the OEM’s latest mini and compact excavator are, “equipped with ICT solutions, safety features such as rear- and side-view cameras, and benefit from the Zaxis-6 cab, which is renowned for being highly comfortable and spacious, with an ergonomic seat and user-friendly controls.”
Wacker Neuson’s Klaus Allerstorfer, product manager, excavators, agrees that, increasingly, features are being added to mini and midi excavators that in the past were only for bigger models.
“Overall, more and more features are now being integrated into smaller models that were previously only used in larger models,” he explains.
“By features, I don’t just mean hardware, but also digital and data-driven solutions. One example is our EquipCare telematics solution, which makes it easier for our customers to manage their fleets and keep track of the condition of their machines.”
Electric powered equipment is a major trend in construction, especially in compact machines such as mini and midi excavators which many believe are more suited to this type of power than larger machines.
As is the case with many OEMs, Hitachi Construction Machinery has recently launched new electric models in this segment (ZX55U-6EB mini and ZX85-6EB compact) as has Takeuchi, with the all-electric TB20e.
Caterpillar, the world’s largest OEM, announced last year that its construction industries division was working on four new electric equipment machines, including the 301.9 Electric Mini Excavator powered by a Cat 48V, 32kWh battery with a run time of up to eight hours on a single charge.
Another new electric model is Bobcat’s 2-tonne mini-excavator the E19e – an electric version of the E19 internal-combustion model. It offers zero emissions, low-noise operation and comparable levels of performance to its diesel-powered counterpart.
The Bobcat E19e features the same profile and external dimensions. It features a 3.5-hour battery capacity and can be recharged quickly using a super-fast charger, meaning that, by topping up the power during work breaks, the machine can be used all day for the majority of typical applications.
Scott Park, Doosan Bobcat CEO, commented, “With the introduction of the E19e, Bobcat has expanded its larger-size electric line-up of zero emission and quiet machines that can match the excellent performance of our conventional models.”
Volvo CE has been at the centre of the development of electric powered construction equipment, with the OEM introducing its first electric compact models back in 2019 and now offering three compact electric excavators and two compact wheeled loaders. Volvo CE’s Abied says that the company are not just looking at compact equipment though, adding that, “While we started with electric mini excavators, we have also grown into the development of mid-size solutions such as our EC230 Electric excavator.”
While larger excavators may be increasingly electrified in the future, the focus is clearly on compact equipment such as mini and midi excavators.
A key point that OEMs make is that, as well as the benefits of electric power such as no emissions, no noise, no vibrations (thus a more comfortable environment for the operator), one thing is key: performance is just as good, if not better, than with diesel models.
Bardas from Hitachi sums it up by saying, “One of the main advantages of our zero-emission mini and compact excavators, the ZX55U-6EB and ZX85U-6EB, is the high level of performance they provide. No compromises have been made in terms of performance and they have been designed to provide similar levels of performance as diesel alternatives. The fact that they are zero-emission and quieter than diesel models are additional benefits.”
Despite all of the benefits that electric power brings, there are also challenges. Arguably the biggest one is the bottom line. To put it simply, electric machines are considerably more expensive than their diesel counterparts.
“When it comes to battery-powered solutions, the purchase price can be a hurdle,” admits Allerstorfer from Wacker Neuson. “But if you look at the total cost of ownership, the e-machines score with very low maintenance and operating costs, which in turn convinces many customers. In addition, we have found that renting the machines can help to quickly overcome initial doubts.”
Durand from Yanmar agrees that the higher cost is putting off some, but also makes the point that the total cost of ownership over the life of the machine can be less. “Indeed, the purchase cost is still higher than with traditional ICE machines. In the long run this price premium should decrease, and we are looking into the total cost of ownership as well which, at the end, is certainly the best criteria for profitability,” he says.
Another issue is undoubtably with charging and infrastructure. If construction is taking place on a remote site and not in a city then there may not be a power source to charge the battery. At the moment there are no universal standards regarding charging hardware and protocols.
“The lack of charging infrastructure and the still slower pace of introduction is a challenge and we need all stakeholders to help deliver the ecosystem required to support our electric machines and, in doing so, together achieve the strategic objectives of the Paris Agreement,” says Volvo CE’s Abied.
“High energy costs and the lack of financial and legal incentives also hamper deployment of strategic initiatives supporting electric power as the competitive solution for mini and midi excavators.”
When it comes to charging solutions increasing numbers of companies are producing fast charging options and there are other options, such as Wacker Neuson’s ‘charging box’.
“We are not only focusing on the development of zero emission products, but are also looking at entire construction site solutions,” says Allerstorfer.
“We will soon be launching our Charging Box, a mobile power bank for the construction site. This will enable customers to charge their zero emission products easily – and above all independently from local power sources.”
While electric mini and midi excavators are growing in popularity, the number of models sold are very small compared to diesel models. So, what’s next for these diesel models? More new technology being integrated into them that makes the life of an operator easier, and was previously reserved for larger machines, is one trend that will continue.
“These newer technological features all have one thing in common – they’re designed to help operators stay comfortable and more productive,” says Caldwell from Takeuchi US.
“They also help ensure that operators know exactly how their machines are performing by providing a great deal of information at their fingertips.”
In Wacker Neuson’s newest excavator, the wheeled EW100, Allerstorfer says that, “Digitisation played a major role in the development of this machine. For example, we have implemented an intelligent attachment management, a state-of-the-art Human-Machine-Interface, and the preparation for various assistance systems for process optimisation.”
Regarding sales around the world, mini and midi excavators are expected to continue to see strong numbers, if perhaps not at the same levels as in recent years.
Mini excavators are machines which replace manual labour. With the economic driver of rising labour costs (plus the difficulty in finding workers ) added to the fact that the purchase cost for these machines is cheaper than ever, adoption will continue.
“Drivers like these are at play in emerging markets, and the large-scale mini excavator industry which has sprung up in China means that machines are more affordable now than they were before,” says Off Highway Research’s Sleight. “This will help drive the adoption of this type of compact equipment around the world in the years to come.”
It will be interesting to see just what technology and power sources these mini and midi excavators of the future are equipped with as standard."
14 April 2023,Case introduces new head of European sales,"Case Construction Equipment has appointed Graziano Cassinelli as its new head of sales for European construction brands at CNH Industrial.
Cassinelli takes over the position from Nicola D’Arpino, who has now become the company’s vice president for Construction Product Portfolio Strategy.
In his new role, Cassinelli will work to boost the manufacturer’s dealer business. He retains his existing responsibilities as the global head of CNH Industrial’s Rental and Used equipment division - which earlier this year announced that its stories in France and South Africa had began renting large earthmoving machinery.
Case said Cassinelli will bring “a wealth of knowledge and experience” to his new position.
As well as having developed and managed rental and used equipment departments, he has previously also held senior positions with several construction equipment manufacturers based in Europe and the Far East, such as Caterpillar and Luigong Machinery."
12 April 2023,Zeppelin buys Danish rental business,"Zeppelin Group is buying Danish rental company CP ApS, a three-location specialist in the rental of temporary accommodation and general construction equipment and tools.
It is the first rental acquisition by Zeppelin in Scandinavia since it became Caterpillar’s dealer in Denmark, Sweden and Greenland in late 2019.
The financial details have not been disclosed and Zeppelin said it hoped the transaction will be complete by the end of May or early June.
CP’s head office is in Viby Sj, west of Copenhagen, and it has other offices in Galten, near Aarhus, and Middelfart. It runs a fleet of 11,000 units and has 150 employees.
Peter Gerstmann, CEO of the Zeppelin Group, said; “The expansion of the integrated solutions offering provided by the Strategic Business Unit Rental takes us a big step forward in building a leading rental organization in our Scandinavian markets.”
Julie Bruun, owner and CEO of CP ApS, said Zeppelin was a buyer with the same values and corporate culture; “Customers of both CP and Zeppelin will experience a complete product portfolio and access to a huge fleet, resulting in an even better service with a total of seven branches in Denmark.
“Zeppelin will take digitalization and sustainability to a higher level and offer the best solutions in the industry.”
Arne Severin, head of the Zeppelin’s rental business unit, added; “The acquisition significantly strengthens our position in a highly competitive market. CP’s portfolio complements ours perfectly and opens up new growth opportunities.”
Bruun will leave CP at the end of June, when she was due to go on parental leave; “I confidently hand over to Zeppelin and look forward to following the journey ahead from the sidelines.”
CP was founded by Georg Bruun in 1986 and began by trading in shipping containers. That business developed into selling and renting temporary accommodation, and was augmented by construction equipment in 2004. Georg’s daughter, Julie, started working at the business in 2013 and became managing director the following year.
Zeppelin Rental has more than 2,000 employees at over 160 locations in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden and Denmark."
05 April 2023,Greening the grey: How are new concrete technologies tackling decarbonisation?,"Construction relies heavily on concrete as a building material; it is one of the most widely used resources around the world. The industry consumes about 4 billion tonnes globally every year and emits almost 2.5 billion tons of CO2 emissions. A versatile material, concrete can be used in foundations, roofing, walls, floors, cladding, and infrastructure such as bridges, dams, and more, due to its adaptability.
With its versatility, the industry has begun to ask for sustainable alternatives and ways to streamline the way that concrete is used.
France-based civil engineering company Eiffage has developed a plant-based asphalt composed of a bio-sourced binder (derived from by-products of the forestry and paper industry) and recycled road-surfacing materials. This mix is said to significantly reduce CO2 emissions linked to road construction activities.
Other companies, such as Liebherr, are focusing on modular concepts to help streamline concrete projects. The new Betomix and Mobilmix mixing plant series can be flexibly combined using prefabricated modules and replace several predecessor series.
For the user, Liebherr says that this means: more freedom when configuring the plants, shorter delivery times, faster assembly and increased parts availability. Improvements to the drive are also said to reduce current consumption by up to 30% and increase weighing accuracy, so that up to 7.5kg of cement can be saved per cubic metre of concrete.
Another area that has seen improvement recently is concrete milling, the removal of concrete. Concrete milling is already an established technology on projects around the globe and, thanks to technological advances, almost all hardnesses and grades of concrete pavement can be cost-efficiently removed. One of the largest concrete removal operations took place recently at Leipzig/Halle Airport in Germany with 15 Wirtgen cold milling machines used.
The first phase of the project involved the removal of the concrete from the north runway and the associated taxiways within 30 days. The resurfacing could only begin after the completion of this first phase. Around 350,000 tonnes of extremely hard concrete reinforced with steel rebar mats had to be removed by this cutting method – a battle against time and tonnage.
Specially modified cold milling machines and years of systematic development in the field of expendable cutting tools guarantee high productivity and efficiency when milling in hard concrete. The removal of reinforced concrete pavements containing tie-bars, dowels and rebar mats is also possible. Selective removal also enables the separation of concrete layers with different properties and the reduction of contaminated material.
The method offers further benefits in terms of environmental protection: As a rule, milled concrete can be recycled without any further treatment. The vibration-free procedure is characterised by low noise and low dust emissions.
“In contrast to milling in asphalt, the enormous hardness of the concrete here meant that we had to take slower milling speeds into account. The wear on the milling tools was also significantly higher. In spite of this, our previous experience from similar projects enabled us to continuously optimise the process,” said project manager Bernhard Fischer.
On display at this year’s ConExpo in Las Vegas, US, Astec’s SB-3000 Shuttle Buggy MTV looks to streamline the loading and unloading of materials onsite. The Roadtec SB-3000 material transfer vehicle stores and transfers hot-mixed asphalt material from truck to paver for non-stop paving. The anti-segregation auger is said to remix material just before delivery to the paver and the 31.7 metric ton (35 ton) storage capacity allows trucks to unload immediately.
Astec says that the SB-3000 design is focused on safety, comfort and productivity to ensure that it is easier for users to operate and safer to transport.
Also, on display was GOMACO’s GP460 placer/spreader slipform paver – the machine was actually making its world debut at ConExpo. As a placer/spreader with a 60 inch (1524mm) belt, the GP460 will accommodate widths up to 50 feet (15.2m) wide. As a concrete slipform paver, the GP460 will pave widths up to 40 feet (12.2m) wide.
It is said to be built on the framework of the GOMACO two-track GP4 slipform paver with the ability to convert the prime mover into a concrete placer/spreader. The prime mover is equipped with vibrator circuits for paving and auger drive circuits for placing.
Controlling the new technology is made possible with the GOMACO-exclusive G+ digital control system. G+ handles the controls conversion needed for each application while also bringing onboard Machine to Machine (M2M) communication, sonic sensors, 3D machine guidance, and more.
The GP460 is powered by a Caterpillar C7.1 turbocharged diesel engine to drive the conveyor belt and distribute concrete across the grade. The high-volume, 60 inch (1,524 mm) conveyor belt can be mounted on either the left or right side, depending on job-site conditions and the location of the haul road.
With the comeback of trade shows, companies are once again able to see concrete equipment up close and personal. In January, World of Concrete returned to Las Vegas, US with attendance of 48,000 registered professionals that was said to be close to pre-pandemic levels.
“The 2023 edition of World of Concrete far exceeded our expectations. The crowded show floor and packed educational sessions proves how essential meeting face to face is, that it remains important now more than ever to have a space to connect, to learn, to share across the concrete, masonry and construction industries as a vital contributor to our economy,” says Jackie James, Vice President, World of Concrete.
One of the biggest trends at both ConExpo and World of Concrete was the continued rise of technology and the impact it is having across the sector. New tech is influencing the way concrete construction equipment is designed and used.
Ingrid Schaar, assistant managing director at Ammann, breaks down how is it being implemented and why we are moving towards technologically advanced concrete equipment. “Since recycled material does not have the same properties as normal aggregates, new metering techniques are required here. The flow behaviour of recycled material requires special storage and metering technology,” she comments.
“Due to the larger selection of binders, the cement scales and the number of metering inlets were also adapted to the new challenges. Modern concrete mixer cleaning systems are more efficient than manual cleaning and thus help to reduce the amount of water needed to clean the concrete plant.”
Raphael Scheps, CEO of UK-based concrete technology company Converge, agrees with Schaar that technology is making its way into the sector, bringing a number of innovative ways to work.
When asked whether data can help streamline the time spent on concrete projects, Scheps replies promptly, “Certainly. With real-time data of in-situ concrete curing, you can take action at the soonest or safest moment possible. You take action precisely when you mean to rather than waiting for slow and sporadic lab results,” he says.
Converge digitises and optimises the physical world of construction by building AI and cloud-based technologies that are powered by a suite of smart wireless sensors. The company’s ConcreteDNA system gives users real-time concrete curing data and AI predictions that are viewable from any device.
Scheps believes that we’re merely scratching the surface of what’s possible for technology in the concrete industry. “Construction is one of the least digitised industries in the world, and yet one of the most fundamental to civilization; we will always need structures to maintain our society. We need construction technologies to make sure that construction is as optimal as possible to minimise adverse impact on the planet,” he says.
“One of our biggest drivers is to decarbonise concrete, the second most consumed material on earth. On a planet with finite resources our mission is to digitise the physical reality of construction in order to make it more efficient, safe, and sustainable.”
Sustainability is also a key focus for Ammann. “Due to the increasing scarcity of resources, the industry is more and more dependent on the use of alternative materials,” says Schaar. “The recycled material is used more and more for concrete production. In addition to this, new cements with less clinker content are being developed to reduce CO² emissions.”
For the whole sector, sustainability is increasingly high on the agenda. New materials coming to market for concrete production as well as new innovative types of concrete will both help to conserve resources and reduce CO² emissions.
Digitising physical reality on the jobsite could be the answer to building more sustainably but that can’t be done unless we measure. He says, “By digitising physical reality, we can track and measure it, allowing us to evaluate the impact of novel materials, methodologies and technologies. In this way we can continuously optimise processes to maximise impact,” says Scheps.
Measuring is also a key component of Doka’s Concremote. The solution uses sensors to measure the temperature and calculates compressive strength of the concrete structure. As the concrete reaches the predefined target value, Concremote will automatically notify the user in real-time by text message or email.
Elsewhere in the industry, the lack of skilled workers has meant that contractors are turning to more semi-automated features but despite construction’s growing enthusiasm for technology, the concrete industry is still largely reliant on workers to manage the machines.
“The task of the simple machinist has changed,” Shaar says. “Due to the high technical operating standards, the mechatronics engineer is a very important person here to monitor and maintain the many automatically controlled processes.”
Due to the changing nature of the construction landscape, the skills shortage and other global challenges the industry is seeking new ways to adapt. Off-site manufacturing has become an alternative solution and reduces the amount of workers that are needed onsite whilst equipment manufacturers are developing ways to streamline the way we work on concrete projects. New technologies are continuing to expand project capacity and decrease the time spent on particular challenges, thus increasing sustainability.
One of the key regions for this increased growth, according to the report, is the Asia Pacific market. The report also looks at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine on the concrete pumps market.
Main players in this sector include: Alliance Concrete Pump, Liebherr, Schwing Stetter, Sany Heavy Industry and Zoomlion.
Ecocem Superfine is a finer Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS) designed to be used as a specialist additive in binders, industrial mortars, UHPC, and precast concrete. In addition to reducing carbon emissions, the use of Superfine can improve rheology, strength, and durability of the concrete.
Developed by grinding Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GBS) to a very fine particle size, Superfine can be added to products to significantly improve their strengths in applications such as high performance and ultra-high-performance concrete.
The Superfine GGBS contains no chemical additions of chromium and has a low pH, making it a safe and effective additive for building material formulations.
“We’ve evolved over the years and want our brand to reflect that. We still design and manufacture concrete vibrators, but we’ve expanded to include flex shaft vibrators and concrete drills,” said Rob Minnich, President/CMO of Minnich Manufacturing.
The company was founded in 1968 to convert concrete paving machines from high-cycle vibrators to hydraulic vibrators. The previous logo included emanating rings, which represented the ripple effect of vibrators. Today, their product line expands beyond the vibrator product line and vibrator monitoring system to include dowel-pin drills, a dust collection system and an upright, lightweight utility drill."
05 April 2023,Zeppelin 2022 revenues ‘remarkable’,"Zeppelin Group has published its 2022 full year financial figures, reporting a sales revenue of €3.8 billion - up 4% on the €3.69 billion it made the previous year - with an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) of €437 million.
Peter Gerstmann, Chairman of the Management Board of the Zeppelin Group, said, “Despite the particular challenges we have faced, especially the war against Ukraine and its effects, the sometimes-challenging political framework on some markets, highly dynamic price behavior, and persistent supply bottlenecks among our manufacturing partners and suppliers, we have achieved a remarkable result thanks to the combined strength and great commitment of our employees.”
The company’s three equipment distribution subsidiaries, Zeppelin Construction Equipment Central Europe, Nordics and Eurasia, brought in €1.51 billion, €292 million and €525 million respectively, alongside another €666 million from subsidiary Zeppelin Rental.
The financial figures, although buoyed by the recovery of the construction market after the Covid-19 pandemic, were significantly impacted by “the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine market”.
The company’s business development strategy for its Construction Equipment Eurasia segment, which in recent years had achieved strong market growth in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, was “abruptly ended” the war. Zeppelin Rental also took a more cautious approach to its plans to increase its market share in the Nordics.
Overall, “Zeppelin came through the crisis year 2022 quite well”, said Andreas Brand, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Zeppelin Group. “The Group responded very quickly and appropriately to the additional challenges.
“The very good cooperation between the management, supervisory board and employee representatives is what sets us apart, especially during the crisis.”
“Zeppelin is currently fulfilling its local service and maintenance obligations in Russia in strict compliance with sanctions and in accordance with its contractual obligations to its manufacturer partner Caterpillar,” but “The assumption is that business in Russia cannot be continued, on a permanent basis.”
Looking to 2023, the company is anticipating further war-related stresses and a continued slowdown of the wider construction industry, and the construction equipment market as a consequence.
But Zeppelin says “the large population of machines and engines provides a solid basis for the service business”.

19 March 2023,ConExpo-Con/Agg draws record visitors,"AEM has hailed a successful ConExpo-Con/Agg and IFPE with a record breaking 139,000 visitors to the Las Vegas show. The exhibition closed on Saturday afternoon, March 18.
Attendees from 133 countries were able to see more than 2,400 exhibitors, covering 3 million square feet of exhibit space, which was 10.5% up on 2020.
Visitor numbers were 6% higher than the pandemic-impacted 2020 event - which closed a day early - and more than 24,000 travelled from outside the USA, representing 17% of the total.
“The innovations in the construction industry unveiled this week will play a role in helping construction professionals drive meaningful and sustainable economic growth,” said Phil Kelliher, Caterpillar senior vice president and ConExpo-Con/Agg show chair.
“Live events in the construction industry are very important, because you can see, touch and experience the products. That value was reaffirmed this past week across the show floor.”
Apart from the positive attendance numbers, the show saw an increased focus on sustainable technologies and products, from battery powered compact machines to hydrogen engines and electric powertrains. Connected technology – taking the next step beyond telematics – was also a big feature of the event.
Volvo Construction Equipment brought several electric and autonomous pieces to its stand in the Festival Lot; Caterpillar showed four battery electric machines as well as prototype batteries for off-road equipment; while Wacker Neuson, John Deere, Case, Takeuchi, New Holland were among others to show electric machines. JCB showcased its new hydrogen combustion engine.
In the construction technology sector, AT&T’s Equipment and Machinery Solutions business brought a solution to help companies track their actual Scope 1 carbon emissions against targets, while EquipmentShare highlighted its T3 platform for connected jobsites.
There were multiple innovations also from smaller businesses, such as Blue Vigil, which unveiled a tethered drone carrying LED lamps which it hopes will provide an alternative to traditional lighting towers.
The next ConExpo-Con/Agg and IFPE will be on March 3-7, 2026, at the same Las Vegas venue."
16 March 2023,Caterpillar awards winner of Global Operator Challenge,"Caterpillar has announced that Patrick Doheny from Australia won the final competition alongside other awards presented by the company during ConExpo 2023.


Caterpillar’s year-long Global Operator Challenge is one of the largest construction industry events, with operators from nearly three dozen countries participating. The Challenge highlights the unique ways construction machine operators  guide Cat machines and use the latest technologies to get the job done.

“Caterpillar created this competition to celebrate machine operators who build our world, advocate and drive awareness for their trade, and highlight solutions that address jobsite challenges,” said Jason Hurdis, Caterpillar Global Operator Challenge Execution Lead and Global Market Professional.
“All of the competitors – and especially our nine finalists – showed tremendous skills and abilities operating the latest Cat construction machines and technologies, manoeuvring through some difficult challenges and showing the world the invaluable role they play in infrastructure creation.”

The Challenge began last year with more than 10,000 operators worldwide signing up to compete. After a pre-qualification phase, the first round featured 5,500 contestants competing in local events organized by 77 Cat dealers in 32 countries. The second round consisted of four regional events held in the United States, Brazil, Spain, and Japan. These competitions included digging a trench, loading a precise amount of dirt, and hauling or manoeuvring the machines through obstacles.

Final scores were based on the operator’s skills, efficiency, and competence in executing a variety of tasks, with penalties imposed for errors. Awards were given to the overall event champion, the individual with the lowest time in each skills challenge, and the team with the lowest combined score.

"
28 February 2023,ConExpo 2023: Show Guide,"It’s official: ConExpo-Con/Agg the biggest trade show in North America, is getting even bigger. The Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), the organisers of the event held every three years, has announced that all available exhibit space for the upcoming show has been sold out, guaranteeing the 2023 edition will be the biggest in its history.
“The addition of the new West Hall and Diamond Lot at the Las Vegas Convention Center gave us, and our exhibitors, a number of new opportunities to show how we are taking the construction industry to the next level,” said Dana Wuesthoff, ConExpo-Con/Agg show director. “Now at 2.8 million sq. ft. of exhibits, there’s more for construction pros to see than ever before.”
Nearly 5% bigger than the record set in 2020, the show will feature 1,800 exhibitors and 150 education sessions during its run from March 14-18, 2023.
Despite being the largest show ever, AEM noted that recent additions to the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) will make it the easiest to get around as well. Beneath the entire LVCC campus runs the Convention Center Loop, an underground transportation system designed by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. It transports convention attendees throughout the campus in under two minutes in Tesla vehicles, free of charge.
AEM said attendee registrations were also on strong pace, as pre-registrations are nearly double what they were at the same time for the 2020 show.
“This is the event that construction professionals, especially those making company-level decisions, and those needing professional development hours, can’t miss,” said Caterpillar Senior Vice President Phil Kelliher, who is ConExpo-Con/Agg show chair. “Seeing the new equipment and techniques on a screen doesn’t compare to seeing it all in person.
“At the show, you can see the equipment, ask questions of the manufacturers themselves, and really understand what the equipment and education can do for your career and business.”
A selection of equipment manufacturers are teasing what they have in store for attendees. Alice Banach, senior marketing manager for Doosan Infracore North America, revealed that ConExpo will be the first-time attendees will be able to see the new brand on its construction equipment, hear the story of why it was chosen and what’s coming next.
“In November 2019, Doosan Infracore showed the first successful live demonstration of a fully autonomous excavator and wheel loader. The demonstration took place at our proving grounds in South Korea,” she explains. “We have developed this technology further and will show the next generation of Concept-X in a demonstration area in our exhibit. There will be other new products and technologies on display including the Doosan electric-powered DX20ZE-7 mini excavator.”
The message the company is conveying with its exhibit is a continuation of a long history of orange equipment in North America.
“We are nearing 40 years since we entered this market. We are the same company with the same talented dealers and staff evolving to the next chapter for the industry,” says Banach. “We expect a lot of interest in the new brand, but the most important message is that the machines have not changed, only the name on them,” she said.
The machines on display will include the new DD100 dozer and the first 100-metric-ton crawler excavator: the DX1000LC-7. As for new product introductions, Banach says Doosan will have a few new products that the North American market will see for the first time and some that will be their global debut. “Our second dozer, the DD130, will be shown, as well as the latest working Concept-X models will be on display,” she added.
For its part, Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) readies itself for a return to ConExpo for the first time since 2017. The company pulled out of the 2020 show due to looming concerns over the spread of Covid-19, which wound up shortening the show by one day and emptied Las Vegas shortly thereafter.
Stephen Roy, president, Region North America, at Volvo CE, says it’s important for equipment manufacturers to make their presence known to construction industry professionals planning to attend.
“For me, it’s really being able to highlight where Volvo is and where we’re at in our journey during a time that has been transformative in our industry,” he says. “ConExpo-Con/Agg offers us a chance to showcase what we have, gather feedback from our customers and engage our industry partners.
“To really make a show like ConExpo-Con/Agg work, the face-to-face aspect of it is so important,” he adds. “I think that’s why Las Vegas is the perfect venue. It attracts so many people, and with all the changes we’re seeing in our industry, I think it’ll be the perfect environment for people to find the latest and greatest innovations, as well as learn what will help their business succeed.”
Volvo is driving a focus on sustainable power and automation, and how it can help customers be more productive, efficient and successful in their efforts to serve their own customers.
“We always say our goal is to make customers successful with their customers, so that’s the approach we’re taking.

“This update reflects our commitment to the foundation built on the McCloskey green while refreshing the product line with a modern approach.”
McCloskey’s green colour will now feature on the chassis and galvanized steel handrails of both its existing and new equipment models – which include electric powered and hybrid machines."
17 February 2023,How are construction OEMs adapting to the circular economy?,"Towards the end of 2021, Sarah Jones, managing director of UK-based plant hire firm Stokey, began exploring the options for replacing the company’s venerable Caterpillar D9 bulldozer which the company had originally bought 14 years earlier and which had clocked up 22,000 machine hours working in quarries around the British Midlands.
Keen to ensure that customers avoided the chances of breakdowns associated with older machines, at first the company had planned to replace the tracked 50,000kg machine with a newer version and either sell off or scrap the old one.
But, inspired by a growing trend in business to reduce carbon emissions and improve its impact on the environment – as well as a wish to cut costs – Jones, like a growing number of other customers, chose to get local Caterpillar dealer Finning to strip down and rebuild the machine instead, replacing the worn parts with used ones which had been returned to a Cat factory and restored or ‘remanufactured’.
Stokey’s decision to choose a certified powertrain (CPT) rebuild, which includes replacing the transmission, engine, differential and final drives with remanufactured alternatives where possible, saved the customer a cool £550,000 compared with the costs of buying a new machine and saved the planet thousands of tonnes of carbon in terms of the energy and resources.
“We’re giving an old machine a completely new lease of life instead of sending it off for resale or worse still, to be broken down and scrapped,” Jones says, posing proudly with the rebuilt machine and sporting a hard hat and hi-vis orange jacket.
Of course, re-using, repairing and reconditioning expensive machinery is nothing new in the construction equipment industry. Independent repair shops, equipment dealers and manufacturers have been offering various levels of repair for well over a century.
But in recent years firms have started taking what has become an industry norm and making a direct connection with meeting company-wide sustainability objectives. Organisations can gain faster near-term value from bringing back existing products and reusing them and incorporating innovations that help achieve net zero and net neutral goals across supply chains.
Caterpillar’s dealers have been running a certified rebuilds programme since 1985, carrying out on each machine over 350 tests and examining 7,000 parts to provide customers with a like-new machine, complete with Cat warranty.
Certified Rebuilds
Mark Holden, product support account manager at Finning UK & Ireland, says that by re-using the most hard-wearing parts of the machine and replacing only the parts which needed it, Stokey’s rebuild cost the company £300,000 (€339,500) compared with the £850,000 o buy a new equivalent D9 dozer. And the rebuilt dozer also costs the planet less in terms of the amount of raw materials and carbon used to make it.
“While the engine, transmission and other key components will eventually need replacing before they fail and cause operational issues, the main chassis and body of the machine is structurally sound so can be stripped back and restored to its former glory and used again and again,” he says.
The Stokey rebuild
In the case of Stokey’s D9 bulldozer rebuild, the entire process lasted from April until June 2022, starting with a pre-repair inspection carried out by Finning lead service engineer Lane Armstrong and was followed by a month-long workshop strip down during which two engineers painstakingly disassembled all external and internal components and sorted through them.
A third stage comprises an in-depth inspection of the machine, looking along the chassis, inspecting the state of the hose work and identifying any damage to the mounts or brakes.
Only after this are the technicians able to provide a recommendation for a full scope of work required and provide a cost and timetable to the customer.
Once agreed, service controller Simon Benton then oversaw the project, ordering in the major components including a remanufactured engine from Caterpillar as well as using Finning service exchange units for components such as final drive units.

Remanufacturing is becoming more and more important within the sustainability goals of OEMs and their dealers.
It means that rather than replacing the D9’s worn engine with a new one, taking up more valuable material and resources, engineers can get hold of a used engine from a previous customer which has been shipped back to the manufacturer and restored to original factory conditions before being returned to the dealer and re-sold at a cheaper price than a new one but offering the same performance and with a manufacturer’s warranty to match.
As well as being the world’s largest construction equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar is also one of the world’s largest remanufacturers, officially offering the service since 1973. And before that, the company boasts that it has been carrying out refurbishments and repairs. It points out that one of the original tractors built by Cat’s predecessor company, Holt Manufacturing Company in 1917, is still in operation today. Components can be remanufactured up to six times.
What is remanufacturing?
Over the last 40 years Cat says its dealers have rebuilt an estimated 37,000 machines, powertrains and components and in 2021 alone they returned 127 million pounds of material to Cat remanufacturing facilities for processing. The sales price of Cat Reman products includes a ‘core deposit’ worth around the same as the value of the materials themselves, which the manufacturer says provides an economic incentive to eventually return the component.
In 2021 the company announced a sustainability goal to increase sales and revenue from Cat Reman by 25% by 2030 from 2018 levels.
The reasons behind this are both environmental and strategic.
Cat says that restoring a cylinder head to factory conditions requires 85% less energy than manufacturing a new one, generating 61% fewer greenhouse gasses. It also uses 86% less water and requires 85% less material. Remanufactured engines are sent to dealers who then use them as part of a comprehensive rebuild.
Moreover, the company estimates that around 35% of its costs lie in overheads, while the majority (65%) are materials costs. So salvaging materials gives a greater business advantage for the company over its competitors.
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity set up by the former British yachtswoman to promote the circular economy, singles out both Caterpillar and aerial platform manufacturer JLG as examples of companies which are successfully moving towards a circular economy by adopting innovative business models.
The foundation cites Caterpillar for providing customers with “multiple product life extension options,” including remanufacturing, rebuilding and second-hand sales.
“The circular economy framework places emphasis on the importance of designing effective products and systems rather than aiming solely for efficiency.
“Caterpillar have employed this strategy in their own product design, and rather than aiming to use less and less material, increasing amounts of consideration goes into creating a product that is intended to be remanufactured a number of times,” the foundation says.
Cat boasts that its equipment is ‘built to be rebuilt’. One of its most cited examples is an engine block with a removable sleeve in the cylinder bore. When the component is recovered, this material can be removed and replaced to return the engine to as-new performance. Previous techniques for remanufacturing engine blocks have involved re-boring the engine cylinder and using a larger piston, but this can only be done up to three times before the quality of the product is affected.
And it’s not just Caterpillar which has big plans to harness the circular economy more. Other manufacturers have also recently announced ambitious growth targets for their own remanufacturing and rebuilding operations.
Volvo Construction Equipment has a target of increasing its remanufacturing business by 60% by 2025 compared with a 2018 baseline. The company also says it expects to see a big growth in its certified rebuilds, driven by sustainability goals, cost-saving initiatives and by the recent supply chain crisis which has made it difficult to get hold of new machines.
Harnessing the circular economy
“We expect to see a significant increase in the number of certified rebuilds carried out in 2023 compared to 2022,” says Hilton Wood, Pennsylvania-based product manager for sales development and aftermarket products and services at Volvo CE. Compared with previous years, rebuilds are receiving more attention and quoting activity is increasing due to tight availability and high demand for machines. An added benefit is the sustainability aspect.”
Hitachi Construction Machinery too reports that customers are increasingly considering refurbishing their own equipment. The company has remanufacturing facilities in 21 locations around the world in ten countries, employing approximately 400 people.
“Cost is undoubtedly a main driver but we are noticing an increasing interest in the circular economy, especially in Scandinavian countries,” says Rob Feskens, parts sales representative at Hitachi Construction Machinery.
“This is often stimulated and driven by government regulations put in place to encourage contractors to work in a more environmentally and sustainable manner.”
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation praises JLG’s partnership with finance company DLL which encourages customers to return equipment to JLG at the end of their lease contracts, allowing JLG to plan and predict when assets will reach its workshop for reconditioning.
“JLG’s reconditioned business pipeline for 2023 is very strong,” says Chris Mellott, VP of sales & service at JLG. “Since the program launched in 1997, it has grown through all economic conditions, regardless of the market conditions (supply chain constraints, looming recession, etc).”
Manufacturers are also highlighting retrofitting services too as another way of extending the life of machinery whilst also reducing carbon emissions.
In February, French OEM Manitou announced that it had signed a deal with rental company Kiloutou to investigate retrofit electrification kits for the manufacturer’s diesel-powered telehandlers. The kits, which will comprise lithium-ion batteries, will open the door to switching from internal combustion to low carbon full electric motors.
“The possibility of giving machines in our fleet a second life, and lowering their emissions, is a key lever in our drive to reduce our indirect emissions,” said François Renault, group fleet and sustainability director of Kiloutou Group. “We are working particularly hard these days to fast track this circular economy solution.”
Extending the life of construction equipment
German construction equipment manufacturer Liebherr reports a similar trend. “Since 2022, we have noticed an increase in customer requests for upgrades and overhauls,” says Wolfgang Pfister, head of strategic marketing and communications at Liebherr.
“What is striking is that customers are looking to apply their machines for a wider range of operations. To stay competitive, our customers require more versatile and multi-purpose machines. The current train of thought is definitely also heading towards longevity and sustainability. The global awareness of green thinking is constantly growing.”
Yet, despite these grand sounding plans, some remain sceptical whether growing remanufacturing businesses is achievable – or even desirable – for OEMs.
One of the key reasons for this is that current rebuilding and remanufacturing practices are highly people intensive. Although much of the construction process for new machinery is automated and done by robotics, disassembly is still done by hand, with engineers inspecting each piece to decide which can be re-used or salvaged for remanufacture and which can only be scrapped.
The nature of the process means that remanufacturing is only currently profitable for the most valuable components such as steel engine components or gears. Even amongst this group, not all components are suitable for remanufacturing, with many too worn or degraded to be considered worthwhile repairing.
Liebherr estimates that remanufacturing results in savings in material of between 75% and 78%, resulting in a reduction in the carbon footprint of a crankshaft by 66% and a crankcase by 61%.
However, the researchers calculate that when rejects are taken into account, the reductions in carbon footprint for both remanufactured elements falls to around half that of its newly manufactured equivalent.
Similarly, the actual remanufacturing processes can also be inefficient and carbon intensive, with cast iron components often requiring welding at pre-heat temperatures greater than 315°C.
And, with most manufacturers only using a few facilities to provide the service globally, many heavy components must be transported long distances, which also adds to their carbon footprint.
Remanufacturing research projects
In order to find ways to increase the amount of material which can easily be remanufactured - and more effective and energy efficient ways of doing it - OEMs and governments are investing heavily in research and development.
The REMADE Institute, a public-private partnership established by the US department of Energy as well as OEMs including Caterpillar, John Deere, Michelin and Nike and academic research institutions such as MIT, Rochester Institute of Technology and Yale, has since 2017 handed out millions of dollars in research grants aimed at looking at just these issues.
Current projects include working with remanufacturing firms to come up with a set of design guidelines which would allow design engineers to integrate remanufacturing considerations into their components in the first place, as well as using machine learning techniques to recognise different types of component damage and to develop a real-time estimate of remanufacturing costs.
Researchers in the Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Pittsburgh are collaborating with Caterpillar on a wide range of projects aimed at increasing the proportion of worn steel components which can be remanufactured such as developing high-tech practical repair techniques to relieve stress in components which are currently unusable and using high speed laser cladding for remanufactured crankshafts and camshafts which is expected to increase the reuse rate from 70% to 95%. The partners are also developing a robust weld repair process that can be achieved at lower temperatures.
Furthermore, the institute is funding research aimed at increasing the range of materials which can be repaired or remanufactured. These include using micro abrasion techniques or laser abrasion to remove the potting material surrounding circuit boards and using automated methods to detect solder joint and interconnection failures on used electronics.
And yet, despite all of this, remanufacturing comprises just a fraction of the business, with most OEMs firmly focused on the more lucrative process of making and selling machines.
Caterpillar’s goal to increase sales and revenue from Cat Reman by 25% by 2030 from 2018 levels comes after the company came short on a previous sustainability goal to grow remanufacturing revenue by 20% from 2013 to 2020 – something the company explained on a fall in overall demand during the first year of the Covid pandemic and on the company’s decision to stop manufacturing on-highway truck engines. The company does not disclose separate remanufacturing revenues.
Agricultural and construction equipment maker Deere & Co, which does disclose the figures from its remanufacturing division, said that revenues stood at $360.4m in 2021 – less than 1% of the company total during the period.
Under Deere’s latest sustainability targets, it plans to grow that figure by 50% to reach $540.6m by 2030. Progress so far is modest: in 2022, the company said revenues from the division grew by 2% to £367.6m.
Bert Avezaat, director of Dutch crane repair specialist Avezaat which specialises in repairing cranes from any manufacturer, says that although the demand for repairs, rebuilds and remanufacturing is getting stronger, businesses like his see little in terms of competition from OEMs who are mostly still concerned with a linear economy model of manufacturing and selling as many new machines as possible for profit.
“In general, the OEMs are more focused on supplying new cranes or parts,” he says. “They carry out repairs but it is not their main business.”
Manufacturers’ focus is still the linear economy
Some customers also remain wary of remanufactured products, preferring the reassurance and prestige of a new product. According to Alexander Pajari, product support director for Volvo CE, raising awareness of the remanufacturing process is a challenge for the manufacturer in China, for example, where any second hand items are traditionally viewed with suspicion.
Moreover, some may worry that by focusing so much on remanufacturing successes in their sustainability goals, OEMs may distract attention from setting goals to cut their own significant carbon footprints. Manufacturers are coming under increasing pressure to slash emissions in line with the Paris Agreement – a process which is likely to cause significant disruption to current working practices.
But back at Finning’s workshop in the West Midlands, Stokey’s Sarah Jones has been converted.
“This experience has certainly opened our eyes to the prospect of considering more rebuilds – both in terms of the financial gains over replacing with a new machine, but with sustainability in mind as well,” she says."
13 February 2023,Technology to advance efficiency of Caterpillar wheeled loaders,"Caterpillar has announced that the new 950 and 962 Next Generation wheeled loaders will feature standard technologies that are said to boost operator efficiencies, provide consistent bucket fill factors and increase productivity by up to 10% over the previous models.
The loaders also offer application-specific designs to excel in tough applications, while service intervals are extended to lower maintenance costs by up to 30%.
Caterpillar says that a range of standard technologies on the 950 and 962 wheeled loaders efficiently monitor, manage and enhance job site operations.
Cat Payload with Assist displays data in real-time to improve productivity and loading efficiency whilst the operator can fully automate bucket loading using the new Autodig function to improve fill factors and loading times.
The high bucket fill factors provided by the new Autodig with Auto Set Tires deliver up to 10% more productivity for the 950 and 962 compared to the previous models says the company. Single clutch and lock-to-lock shifting of the five-speed transmission offers faster acceleration and speed on grades.
The new 950 and 962 come standard with a rear-vision camera to enhance visibility behind the loader and work safely. All-around visibility is achieved through the cab’s floor-to-ceiling windshield, large mirrors with integrated spot mirrors and a rear-vision camera.
Additionally, the optional multiview (360-degree) vision system, Cat Detect radar technology, an access light and an under-hood service lighting system are available to further enhance safe operation and maintenance."
10 February 2023,A history of machine control: part two,"This is the second part of an article on machine control, to read part one click here.
In brainstorming sessions, Trimble application engineers came up with the idea to put two receivers on the blade – making way for the Moving Baseline RTK technology.
Mark Nichols, then Trimble’s general manager for construction, remembers how that came about. “At the time, we had developed moving baseline technology for Japanese car manufacturers to truth the newly developed dynamic cruise control system.”
In traditional RTK, operators use a static base on a known point with rovers moving relative to the static base for centimeter accuracy. For the cruise control truthing, the engineers had the base move. A receiver was placed on a pace car and the vehicle with cruise control.
With the RTK positioning, the manufacturer can see a centimeter-accurate vector between the two units, and can subsequently calculate a precise heading from the vector – thus validating the cruise speed set by the cruise control solution.
Soon after, Trimble introduced BenchGuide, essentially a GPS-based leveling system for mining. This technology utilised off-the-shelf Trimble hardware and cabling to provide a shovel operator a centimeter level height on the bench of a mine.
Bryn Fosburgh, who joined Trimble in 1994, added, “The unique part of this system was that we used developers from our survey controller team to develop at the time an easy to use and intuitive user interface that made it effortless for a shovel operator to utilise the system.”
Then they moved to civil construction. On a piece of heavy equipment, this same system (two receivers on the blade) could be used to measure the vector across the blade providing slope and rotation. One receiver provides centimeter positioning of the blade, and the moving baseline algorithm provided the slope of the blade and how much it had rotated in any direction.
By 1999, the team was ready to test in the field, and Arthur Taylor, another key member of the development team, provided the venue – his father’s construction company, Taylor Contracting. “We put it on a grading machine to test and could immediately see that it sped up iterations and design changes,” said Nichols.
The first official commercial deployment of the system, which cost US$50,000, was in Elgin, Illinois, in August 1999 on a John Deere 750 dozer. The operator was a 55-year-old man who had never used a computer in his life. Kurt Maynard, [Field Engineer] and current business development manager at Trimble, recalled, “He was confident in his laser system, but wary about the GPS. After 30 minutes of verifying the GPS versus his paper map, he threw the maps off the back of his bulldozer and continued on with GPS.”
“It was a huge step for the industry,” Nichols added, “We advertised the system as a stakeless grade control system. The first customer would only buy the system under the condition that he could get his money back. The system was installed, and two weeks later he called to buy another one. That’s how well accepted the technology was in the industry after a short time.”
The system offered compelling benefits. It gave the operator a degree of independence and flexibility, reduced rework, fuel consumption, machine operating hours and had a measurable ROI. Productivity improvements ranged from 15-25% depending on the application.
“As soon as someone tried it, they bought it,” added Nichols. Trimble would introduce its first GPS based stakeless grade control system at ConExpo in 1999.
In 2000, Trimble acquired Spectra Precision, a move that would expand the company’s machine control portfolio to include the automated blade control with robotic total stations. Soon, these talented engineers would combine innovations to deliver an automated 3D grade control system initially on a dozer, then a motor grader and, more recently, on an excavator.
However, before spotlighting more recent advances, no machine control story would be complete without reference to Caterpillar – and the ultimate goal to remove the need for survey stakes.
Caterpillar has been an innovator in the big machine world since its founder invented the first commercially successful track-type tractor in 1904, the diesel engine and the radio remote-controlled track loader for slag removal in 1968.
Years later, the RTK research contract from the 1990s with USACE helped facilitate the company’s innovation in 3D machine control with GPS in parallel with Trimble’s efforts.
Caterpillar’s research program reached a point where it had very advanced software running on the machine and good back office support, but the R&D team needed a commercial GPS partner. They picked Trimble because they could get the GPS receiver as well as the two-way wireless communications system. That led to the development of the Computer Aided Earthmoving System (CAES) for bulldozers and excavators, which was first introduced Black Thunder Mine in Wyoming in 1995. The system showed if the operator was above or below grade, but didn’t control the blade automatically.
“This happened to be with a very progressive customer who already used our GPS survey equipment to more efficiently put in survey stakes,” recalls Fosburgh. “The preproduction machine control system eliminated the stakes altogether. This was the start of a big shift, where the surveyor’s role on projects started to become more like that of a data manager.”
Forrest added, “While this effort validated that machine control was a real possibility, it also drove Trimble to improve the field-readiness of our solutions to work in rugged mining and construction environments.”
That early partnership would form the basis for the formation of the Caterpillar Trimble Control Technologies (CTCT) in 2002 to develop machine control and guidance products for both the mining and construction industries, for factory or aftermarket installation on any make or model of equipment regardless of manufacturer.
The advancement of machine control continues, now with greater focus on increased automation of other elements with a clear eye on autonomy.
For instance, Dynapac and Trimble partnered in 2020 to develop commercial-ready autonomy functionality for Dynapac soil rollers that include automated steering and speed functions. In 2022 Trimble introduced Horizontal Steering Control functionality, becoming the industry’s first automatic steering control solution for soil compactors, further addressing the global labor shortage with automated workflows that deliver the quality of highly trained operators.
Add in advancements that range from autonomous self-levelling and blade control systems to unmanned paver fleets and it’s clear that the industry is well on its way to achieving unprecedented operational improvements. Embedded AI, machine learning and 5G are enabling the development of ‘expert operator’ machine automations, and broadening the applications of machine control systems.
It’s an evolution that the early innovators of machine control could have only dreamed of. In 2000, after Trimble had committed to GPS-enabled machine control technology, Forrest envisioned the future. “We knew there was a benefit to controlling grade, but we knew even then it was just a foundational step,” he said.
“We have always imagined a scenario where all of the machines on the jobsite talk to each other in real-time – and that crews could receive real feedback about their work. We’re doing that to a great extent in mining. However, in construction space, it’s not embedded in the workflows – yet. We have the technology and the mindset to fully automate the construction continuum just like we imagined 20 years ago.”"
31 January 2023,Caterpillar CEO: 2022 one of company’s ‘best’ years,"Caterpillar has revealed that sales for its construction industries division was US$6.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of US$1.1 billion, or 19%, compared with the same quarter in 2021.
Sales increased strongly in North America, up by 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Sales in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022 totalled US$3.5 billion.
Latin American sales grew 39% from the fourth quarter of last year to this year, albeit from a much lower level than in North America. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EAME) saw sales increase by 10%, the same percentage that sales dropped by in Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
The OEM’s resource industries, which includes mining equipment, saw fourth quarter sales increase by 26% to US$3.4 billion. The primary driver for this growth was North America, with sales up by 59% in the fourth quarter from the same quarter in 2021. Sales increased in all regions: by 21% in Latin America; 12% in EAME; and 5% in Asia Pacific.
As a company, full-year sales and revenues in 2022 were US$59.4 billion, up 17% compared with $51.0 billion in 2021. Sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 was US$16.6 billion, a 20% increase compared with US$13.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.
“Our global team delivered one of the best years in our nearly 100-year history, including record full-year adjusted profit per share,” said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby.
“Despite supply chain challenges, the team achieved double-digit top-line growth and generated strong ME&T free cash flow. We remain committed to serving our customers, executing our strategy and investing for long-term profitable growth.”"
24 January 2023,A history of machine control: part one,"Machine control has forever changed the way roads are paved, dirt is moved and holes are drilled. It has improved productivity, efficiency, quality and provided measurable sustainability improvements – transforming the way buildings, roads, bridges and other assets are built around the world. But it didn’t happen overnight.
Over the last two decades, machine control systems have been implemented on all sizes of machines, from excavators and dozers to track loaders and skid steers.
While not yet on every jobsite, the technology is firmly established in the industry, with manufacturers even preloading capabilities on machines at the factory. The innovations made and lessons learned over the years have become a foundation for emerging autonomous solutions.
Few likely remember that the magic of machine control began almost 60 years ago and progressed largely due to creative thinkers and the leaders who gave them the freedom to explore the application of innovative technologies in new and different ways.
Machine control on heavy equipment has been around since the 1960s with the advancement of lasers. At the time, the Hughes Research Laboratory in California, US, built the first laser prototype, an optical resonator that created a narrow beam of light. That technology would become the foundation for military-grade range finders. The ability to measure the distance between the instrument and a target quickly attracted the attention of the agricultural community.
The story goes that there were two concurrent advancements. The first laser grade control was developed by agricultural engineers James Fouss and Norman Fausey of The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA’s) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) at The Ohio State University in the mid-1960s for an agricultural drainage machine. Using photocells mounted on trenching and plow-type drainage machines, the system automatically raised and lowered the digging device to a controlled depth and subsurface grade dictated by a laser beam set to the desired elevation and grade. The necessary signal processing circuit was designed and fabricated for ARS by Control Systems Co. of Urbana, Ohio, which was co-owned by Ted L. Teach.
Around the same time, Robert H. Studebaker, of Tipp City, Ohio, began to develop a laser controlled motor grader using a rotating prism to create a ‘plane’ of laser light that could control several machines on a field for flat and sloping planes.
In 1967, Studebaker and Teach formed Laserplane Corp., the first laser company. The subsequent advances led to the first demonstration of laser control on a trenching machine in September 1968 at the Ohio State Farm Science Review by ARS researchers and Laserplane.
Soon, these innovators would add sonic sensors, instruments that measure the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. The sonic sensors expanded machine control from cutting flat or sloping planes, to controlling machines such as motor graders and pavers for both elevation and steering. These sensors allowed a machine to follow a non planar surface (e.g., stringline, curb line, edge of seal) in elevation and a horizontal alignment.
The combination of rotating lasers and sonic tracers established the first generation 1D/2D machine control solutions (elevation and steering) that continued to evolve over the coming years. The result was a dual automatic blade control solution, called the BladePro System.
“It was a pretty crude system that relied on an off-the-shelf black and white screen and a handheld computer,” said Mark Forrest, then working for Spectra Precision as the Product Manager. “But we could automatically control the cross slope of the blade on the motor grader. Then we added an ultrasonic sound sensor to measure a relative elevation, so that we stayed above the stringline.”
In 1995, Forrest moved to Dayton, Ohio to be a product manager for this early machine control solution.
It wasn’t until the late 1990s that two advances – the robotic total station and GPS – would jump-start the evolution of 3D machine control. Spectra Precision would have competition for these early solutions very soon. Topcon Laser Systems Inc. was established in 1994, the same year Topcon acquired Advanced Grade Technology, its entry into the 2D machine control business.
In 1996, Steve Berglund took over as the president of Spectra Precision and formed a team to “see how we could move existing machine control to 3D,” recalled Forrest. Spectra Physics had merged its Geotronics Division to become just Spectra Precision. They had also acquired a small software company called Plus3 that had a product called Terramodel.
“Rather than a surveyor setting stringlines for machines to follow, we wanted to automatically control those machines as they moved,” Forrest said.
The next development, shown at Bauma in 1998 was called BladePro 3D. BladePro 3D was a system that combines a robotic total station with digital terrain model (DTM) design software to automatically control elevation and cross slope of a motor grader blade, eliminating the need for stringlines.
Hexagon/Leica Geosystems would also begin to move into the 3D machine control space. With the acquisition of Magnavox in 1994, Leica would have its first GPS product. In 2000, it would acquire Laser Alignment Inc. to combine with its GPS capabilities as a foundation to its 3D machine control technology.
But it was the commercialization of GPS that would provide the much needed utility to make blade control relevant for the masses – Bryn Fosburgh, a physical scientist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) at the time, remembers these days well.
In 1991, as a member of the Army Research team, formerly the Engineering Technology Laboratory (ETL) at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Fosburgh’s job was to research GPS and its applications for the civilian and military sectors of the U.S. Army. The focus was largely related to the dredging research program using differential GPS and real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning. He was a member of the USACE RTK Team, working with Ben Remondi, a GPS RTK pioneer. USACE later worked with Caterpillar through a small business innovation research (SBIR) contract to put RTK on a machine.
Subsequently, Trimble would introduce its first RTK GPS receiver in 1992 and Fosburgh would join Trimble in 1994 and help guide the next evolution of GPS and RTK.
“Charlie Trimble saw GPS as the next utility,” said Fosburgh. “He gave all of us engineers full rein to find ways to proliferate it on any platform.”
The second part of this article will be published next week."
13 January 2023,Why construction equipment OEMs are making acquisitions,"Ola Kinnander, media relations manager at mining equipment giant Epiroc, reels off a list of names; Mernok Elektronik (South Africa), Remote Control Technologies (Australia), Wain-Roy (US), RNP Mexico; just a few of the companies the mining equipment giant has acquired in 2022.
“Acquisitions are part of our strategy for profitable growth,” Kinnander says, pointing to a total of nine acquisitions made in 2022 for companies all over the world specialising in everything from wireless connectivity in mines and collision avoidance systems to rock drill manufacturers and excavator attachments. And that comes after the Swedish giant made eight acquisitions in 2021.
Certainly, since Epiroc was spun out of Swedish engineering group Atlas Copco in June 2018 with an estimated market cap of SEK120bn (US$14bn), the company has been unashamedly acquisitive, spending an estimated SEK3.5bn-SEK4.5bn (US$333m-$428m) on acquisitions in 2022 alone.
Like many construction and mining OEMs, Epiroc has been engaged in an acquisitions arms race, eager to benefit from a post-pandemic boom to buy up firms offering technology.
The goal is to make its machines more efficient, more environmentally sustainable and safer, as well as to gain market share in a market where skills shortages, inflation and supply chain issues have been causing bottlenecks.
For mining equipment manufacturers, like Epiroc, the race has become particularly intensified over the past couple of years because rising demand for commodities has prompted raw materials groups to expand their mines.
Many have started to search deeper underground for mineral deposits – and are opening up markets for technology which can enable them to mine at deeper levels more efficiently.
“We are growing organically but also through acquisitions,” Kinnander says. “They not only add to our revenues but bring us vital technologies and expertise in areas that we are focusing on, including automation, digitalisation, electrification, and the aftermarket. For us it is therefore natural to have more acquisitions than divestments.”
Epiroc’s latest purchase, announced on 13 December 2022, is CR, a 400-strong ground engaging tools provider headquartered in Australia, which produces cast lips, teeth and protective shrouds installed on mining buckets and loaders and whose digital solutions include a real-time GET loss detection system which last year produced revenues of AUS$240m ($164m).
“We focus our acquisitions on the niches that we operate in, which are hard rock mining, mining exploration, and civil engineering and construction,” Kinnander says.
“The acquired company should also be attractive from a growth and profitability point of view and have strong synergies and strategic fit with Epiroc, and they should also be able to have a leadership position within the niche.”
In fact, of the seventeen companies acquired by Epiroc over the last two years, around half produce specialist mining software of some kind, while the remainder mostly produce specialist machinery or electrification expertise.
“New and relevant technology – for example that they provide advanced connectivity solutions or electrification infrastructure – and the competent teams that come with the acquisitions can certainly also be strong factors for why we would be interested in acquiring a specific company,” Kinnander reveals.
And Epiroc is not alone. Caterpillar, Komatsu and Sandvik are just a few of the multinationals which have been on the acquisition trail as part of this new technology arms race.
Sandvik, which also specialises in manufacturing engineering and construction equipment, purchased nine new companies in 2022 and 14 the previous year.
“Shift to growth is a central part of our strategy with focus on organic growth as well as acquisitions,” a Sandvik spokesman says. “We have a strong balance sheet and good cashflow generation that allows for further investments.”
Sandvik points out that research and development traditionally forms a major part of its investment strategy while many of its recent acquisitions have been based around getting hold of cutting-edge digital technology and expanding the company’s expertise in the solid round tools sector.
”We focus on the digital shift where Sandvik enables companies in many industries to boost productivity and become more sustainable with digital solutions, from automated mines with self driving machines to factories where tool data and machining instructions are updated from the cloud,” the spokesman adds.
“Solid round tools is a fast growing segment in which we want to expand. The demand is driven by the transition towards lighter materials and requirements on high precision tools.”
Japanese manufacturer Komatsu announced in June 2022 that it had agreed to acquire Australia-based Mine Site Technologies, a company specialising in improving mining productivity through leveraging communication devices and position tracking systems.
Then, just six months later the company was back on the acquisition trail, buying underground mining specialist GHH Group from the German owned Schmidt Kranz Group.
And Caterpillar, the world’s largest supplier of both mining and construction equipment, too has been boosting its offering with a number of key acquisitions.
These include Australia-based Minetec which supplies high-precision tracking and data communications networks and software to improve productivity and safety.
They also, in May 2022, included US-based Tangent Energy, which uses Energy as a Service (Eaas) software to monitor customers’ energy use patterns and then come up with ways of dispatching resources to maximise return and monitise results without disrupting normal business operations – something which can be especially beneficial for customers with high peak energy demands such as mining operations and data centres.
And Caterpillar started 2023 announcing an investment in US-based battery technology company Lithos Energy, which produces lithium-ion battery packs.
Carl Gustaf Göransson, a former president of construction at CNH Industrial and managing director of Volvo Construction Equipment, who jointly runs off-road consultancy ABCG with Alan Berger, says current business conditions make expansion and diversification particularly attractive to OEMs.
“Throwing money at a problem can both add scale and competence fast,” he says.
“What comes in addition to this in CE [the construction equipment manufacturing industry] is the fact that we have a traditional business undergoing a large transformation in many areas. This includes new business models (e.g., power by the hour), technology, autonomy and the shift from internal combustion engines to electric power.”
Göransson describes the unprecedented pressures on OEMs to buy up tech firms as the “triple technology challenge,” with manufacturers rushing to add technology quickly in three key areas; connected products and automation, alternative fuels and disruptive business models.
Examples of recent acquisitions based around connected products and automation include Doosan Bobcat’s strategic equity investment in US-based startup radar technologies company Ainstein AI to develop hi-tec radar sensor systems for Bobcat equipment.
Deals featuring alternative fuels include CNH Industrial’s decision in April 2021 to take a minority stake in UK-based Bennamann, a company specialising in developing biogas and liquid biofuel from animal waste.
They also include Caterpillar’s 2021 investment in US-based CarbonPoint, a carbon capture specialist that provides technology to concentrate and capture CO2 which can then be either used or buried so that it is kept out of the Earth’s atmosphere.
Disruptive business model acquisitions include engine manufacturer Cummins’s move to invest in California-based asset management and software energy firm Exergy Energy as part of a plan to enable customers to switch to Cummins power systems solutions during outages.
It is not just traditional OEMs who are out to acquire construction tech specialists either. Construction tech firms themselves have also been highly acquisitive as they seek to buy up rivals and add technical know-how to their offerings while the asset class has also attracted venture capitalists and private equity investors.
Construction software giant Trimble’s recent acquisitions include US-based B2W Software in September 2022, France based Bilberry in August 2022 and US-based AgileAssets in December 2021.
Similarly, in September 2021, telematics specialist Trackunit announced it had acquired the Industrial IoT division of competitor ZTR.
Just a few months earlier Trackunit itself announced that software investor Hg had agreed to acquire a controlling interest in the company from Goldman Sachs and GRO Capital.
Michael Staebe, partner at Bain & Co points out that strong demand for tech firms means that they are reaching valuations far higher than similarly sized traditional manufacturing firms.
“Targets with attractive capabilities are highly valued,” he says. “Consider that tech assets trade, on average, at 25 times EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization] with high growth expectations vs. 13 times for targets in the industrial core (and acquirers’ own valuation).
“For example, Hitachi’s acquisition of digital engineering and design firm GlobalLogic at US$9.6 billion implies an EBITDA multiple of more than 37 times.
“Many companies are also taking a portfolio approach to developing these capabilities, through corporate venture capital, joint ventures, and partnerships.”
Moreover, Göransson cautions that the sheer scale of the emerging technology will limit the amount of tech specialisms OEMs can hold.
“The simple fact is that there isn’t enough bandwidth within even quite large OEMs to manage the manifold changes alone,” he says. “Certainly not with their current structure and set up both from a knowledge perspective.”
And, with rampant inflation, high interest rates and the War in Ukraine looking set to lead to a global recession in the coming months, the occupants of many company C-suites may be tempted to rein in their appetites for further acquisitions in 2023.
Yet Göransson predicts that appetite among OEMs for tech companies is so great that the rate of acquisitions is unlikely to slow down in 2023, despite a sluggish economy making business conditions increasingly difficult.
“Normally the appetite for new investments goes down during these times, however combining the extraordinary factors such as post covid, world economy under pressure alongside with the transformation in the industry, we are likely to see a further increase in M&A activities in the coming 12-24 months,” he says.
Back in Sweden, S&P forecasts that Epiroc’s acquisition spending could increase to SEK8bn-SEK10bn (US$761m-$952m) in 2023.
“We are constantly looking for strong and relevant companies to potentially add to the Epiroc family,” says Kinnander. “We are in a strong financial position, and we think and act long-term, so our strategy in this area is not really affected by a looming recession.”"
06 January 2023,Cat invests in US battery specialist,"Caterpillar said it is investing in Lithos Energy, Inc., a US specialist in the design and manufacture of lithium-ion battery packs. The amount invested has not been disclosed.
Headquartered in San Rafael, California, Lithos produces shock resistant and high performance battery packs for applications including off-road vehicles and marine. The company was founded in 2015 by two MIT graduates, including current CEO James Meredith, a former Tesla design engineer.
“Caterpillar’s collaboration with Lithos supports our commitment to delivering robust electrified products and solutions for our customers,” said Joe Creed, group president of Caterpillar’s Energy & Transportation segment.
“Cat equipment – regardless of its power source – is designed to operate in the most demanding conditions. Lithos’ experience manufacturing battery packs for similarly demanding environments will be an asset as we continue our electrified product development.”
James Meredith at Lithos said the company was extremely excited to be working with Caterpillar, “especially at a time when the leading construction machinery and equipment manufacturer is entering a new age of efficiency and reduced emission operation.
“Caterpillar’s forward thinking, commitment to electrification and leadership position on the global stage for equipment manufacturers make this an ideal match.
“This funding will enable Lithos to accelerate technology development and scale up manufacturing capacity as we look forward to providing increasingly advanced product offerings to our new and existing customers.”
Caterpillar said the investment demonstrated its commitment to support customers in the energy transition with lower-carbon power technologies for hybrid and full-electric machines as well as power generation products.
The company recently displayed four electric construction machine prototypes, including battery prototypes, at Bauma 2022 in Munich, Germany and demonstrated its first battery electric 793 large mining truck at its Tucson Proving Ground in Arizona.
Also at Bauma the company showed off-highway battery pack prototypes.
"
26 December 2022,What were the top construction stories of 2022?,"Acquisitions, new product launches and the break out of war in Ukraine all come to mind when thinking back on the biggest stories in construction in this year.
This was the year that we started to see a prolonged period of recovery from Covid, while also meeting and overcoming new challenges. As we enter the final weeks of the year, Construction Europe looks at the top stories from construction in 2022.
The €8 billion Ellinkon smart city project by real estate firm Lamda Development took a significant step forward in August when the company opened The Ellinkon Experience Centre in Athens, Greece.
Designed to highlight the magnitude of the smart city project, said to be the largest urban regeneration undertaking anywhere in Europe, the interactive Centre has been built on the site of the former Athens International Airport.
Construction Europe published its list of the Top 100 construction companies in Europe 2022.
France-based Vinci once again came out on top, and extended the lead from second placed Bouygues’ Construction Divisions in the process.
Three of the top five companies on the list are France-based, while only one company managed to break in to the top 10 this year, Spanish firm Acciona.
US-based utility firm Ditch Witch unveiled what it claims to be the largest directional drill in the world at Bauma.
The AT120, which will enable users to drill long, large diameter bores, comes with a Stage V Cummins engine, 533.8 kN of thrust and pullback and 21,015 Nm of rotational torque.
Ditch Witch says the machine will be rolled out globally in the future, and is particularly ideal for pipeline, oil field, gas, sewer and water work.
The first Volvo Days event to take place since Covid saw the company reveal its 22 tonne electric excavator the EC230.
The battery-electric machine runs on four 66kW lithium-ion batteries, which are said to enable it to reduce running costs by up to 70% when compared with its diesel-powered version.
Although currently unavailable commercially, the EC230 is undergoing testing before it officially launches.
Rolls-Royce SMR and Škoda JS will collaborate on the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the Czech Republic and other parts of Central Europe after the respective companies signed a memorandum of understanding in September.
Rolls-Royce say the partnership will allow it to develop and deploy its own SMRs in the future, through the utilisation of ‘Škoda JS’ experience of producing pressurised water reactors,’ with which SMRs are based on.
At the beginning of the year, Saint-Gobain UK and Ireland announced details of the sale of three of its UK-based brands.
The company finalised the sale of the distribution businesses, Neville Lumb, DHS and Bassetts, which specialise in plumbing, heating and sanitaryware products.
The sale of the companies to Wolseley UK was finalised in March. Following the completion of the transaction, Saint-Gobain also announced the respective companies were finalising the sale of its Ideal Bathrooms subsidiary, which concluded in February.
Representing construction giant Caterpillar at Bauma was its German dealer Zeppelin, and at the trade show the company unveiled four elecrtric prototype machines.
These included the 20 tonne 320 medium electric excavator, 950 GC medium electric wheeled loader, 301.9 electric compact excavator and, 906 electric compact wheeled loader.
The machines are powered by Cat’s 48v, 300v and 600v lithium-ion batteries and, according to Product specialist Alan Davies, each model features on board charging capability.
The compact excavator and wheeled loader are expected to be launched in 2024, with no confirmation yet as to when the 950 GC and 320 will be available.
Global economic analysis specialist ING released its EU Construction Outlook report for 2022 in February, which revealed a projected output growth of 2.5% for the year.
The company said that its findings revealed that business confidence at the beginning of 2022 was positive, and despite rising costs and material shortages, the EU construction sector could expect growth in 2022 and 2023.
However, the report was carried out before the breakout of war in Russia, which has impacted the sector and as a result, ING published new findings in September to reflect this.
Having been delayed due to the pandemic, the aforementioned global trade show Bauma returned for the first time in three and a half years in Munich, Germany, in October.
Although visitor numbers were down on previous years, organiser Messe Munchen said nearly half a million visitors attended, with an array of construction equipment on show across the week-long event.
While there was plenty of diesel-powered machines on show at Bauma, this year saw electric machines take centre stage, with manufacturers keen to showcase the latest developments in environmentally-friendly machinery.
When war broke out in Ukraine in late February, the repercussions were felt around the world. An already fragile supply chain was further impacted by the events, while prices of oil and gas rocketed as the news broke.
This was, of course, felt by the construction sector, with manufacturers relying on materials and oil and gas from Russia.
The initial response from many within the sector was to condemn the actions of Russia,  and throughout the course of the next few weeks and months, companies such as Aggrekko, Dinolift, Hitachi Construction Machinery, Komatsu and JCB all ceased operations in Russia.
More recently, the EU confirmed it could seize €300 billion from the Russian Central Bank to rebuild Ukraine."
21 December 2022,New sustainability officer appointed at Caterpillar,"Caterpillar has appointed Dr Lou Balmer-Millar as Chief Sustainability Officer, added to her existing responsibilities as Senior Vice President of the Large Power Systems Division within Cat’s Energy and Transportation segment.
She will report directly to CEO and Chairman Jim Umpleby and succeeds Julie Lagacy, who was Caterpillar’s first Chief Sustainability & Strategy officer. Lagacy will retire on 1 February, 2023 after nearly 35 years at the company.
Balmer-Millar has worked at Caterpillar for 20 years, holding technical and business positions of increasing seniority.
Before Cat, she led materials and chemical engineering research at the Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
Balmer-Millar has a Ph.D. in Materials Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara and a Bachelor of Science in engineering from Pennsylvania State University.
“Sustainability is an important focus area of our long-term strategy for profitable growth,” said Jim Umpleby.
“Building on her role in Caterpillar’s Energy & Transportation segment, this move further enhances the advancement of product solutions to support our customers during the energy transition and help them achieve their climate-related objectives by geography, by application and by specific customer need.”"
16 December 2022,Caterpillar partners with a customer to bring robot haul trucks to smaller sites,"Autonomous heavy equipment is not so much a technology of the future as a current tech waiting to be scaled for different kinds of jobs.
So it’s kind of a big deal for Caterpillar to collaborate with Luck Stone, the largest family-owned and operated producer of crushed stone in the U.S., to deploy driverless autonomous hauling to Luck Stone’s Bull Run Plant in Chantilly, Va. It will be Caterpillar’s first application of robot trucks outside the mining industry and will expand the company’s autonomous truck fleet to include the 100-ton-class (90-tonne-class) Cat 777.
Caterpillar has fielded the world’s largest fleet of autonomous haul trucks, now numbering more than 560. These trucks have traveled more than 116 million miles (187 million kilometers) and autonomously moved more than 5.6 billion tons (5.1 billion tonnes) of material, all without a single zero lost-time injury.
Luck Stone’s Bull Run Plant will implement Caterpillar’s Cat MineStar Command for Hauling system on a fleet of 777G trucks. Insight gained on this project will help Caterpillar tailor the next generation of the technology specifically to quarry and aggregate work. The idea is to adapt the technology to operations with fewer mobile assets in a way that generates the step change in safety and productivity common at autonomous mining operations.
“Luck Stone and Caterpillar’s partnership has been grounded in shared values for many years,” said Charlie Luck, president and CEO of Luck Companies. “Together we believe that safety, innovation and a commitment to people are critical, not only to propelling important projects like this, but to ensuring our focus on the future and all of the exciting possibilities technology affords our industry. Our collaboration will provide opportunities for associates to learn and grow, improve safety and result in production efficiencies. We are thrilled to partner with Caterpillar to achieve this ‘first’ for our industry.”
Minestar will be implemented at Bull Run in 2024."
14 December 2022,Interview: Zeppelin COO on green equipment,"One of the surprising things I learn about Zeppelin Rental COO Peter Schrader when we meet at Bauma is that he is something of a Heavy Metal fan; but Schrader is also experiencing his own revelations.
“This is the eleventh Bauma for me, but I never expected that we would have so many customers every day, at the same high levels,” he says.
We meet on the Zeppelin Rental stand on the final Friday of the trade fair – just before the weekend crowds descend.
In the background, heavy metal also takes shape in a vast, yellow-liveried showcase of Caterpillar machinery, including electric prototypes, other low emissions machines and more.
This year’s Bauma represents a new move for Zeppelin Rental’s sister company and Cat dealer Zeppelin Baumaschinen, which took responsibility for showcasing Cat construction equipment, services, and solutions at the trade fair.
Steady numbers of visitors to Zeppelin Rental’s area could in part be attributed to the joint stand, located prominently in a central interior space; but Zeppelin Rental seems to be a magnet in its own right.
Its stand, busy with visitors when IRN arrives, exhibits Zeppelin Rental’s full capability; among the features on show is the ‘Rentagon’ hosting solutions for rental including BIM enabled machine deployment, the Rental+ app, the Eco Rent program for emissions reduction and more.
“We are very happy, and I’d say it has been a real success. It’s a good outlook for 2023,” Schrader says of the Bauma 2022 experience.
That optimism is offset by a note of caution on Germany and Zeppelin Rental’s other geographies - Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Sweden, and Denmark.
“Really, nobody knows what will happen next year in Germany or in Europe. This year, my thought is, after Bauma it looks ‘not so bad’. Typically, after Bauma I’d say it looks good.”
“Given the current political and economic situation, everything can change every day.”
Despite or because of headwinds from supply delays to the Ukraine conflict and inflation, Schrader believes rental remains relevant.
“We have the equipment; we have the ability to help our customers in terms of reducing their emissions and helping with efficiencies. But it’s not just about providing equipment; it is about service through things like the Rental+ app, and the Eco Rent program.”
That program, now 10 years old, has proven successful in the rental of green equipment and “solutions for our customers on lowering emissions” a key focus for the company.
It has also entailed a learning curve. “What we learned is that it’s not so easy to push low emissions machinery. Low emissions equipment is more expensive, it’s more price intensive,” he tells IRN.
The Zeppelin stand has several Cat electric prototypes on display, and Schrader confirms that overall, Zeppelin Rental is investing “more and more” in electric and alternative power products; “Our capex next year will be more on electric and on other alternative drives than last year.”
But he also acknowledges challenges. “That equipment is two or three times more expensive for us to purchase and it’s hard not to reflect that in rental rates.
We have a big challenge to convince the market - the end customers, the contractors, the tier one construction companies – that electric and alternative drives are the way to go.”
In addition to electric, Zeppelin is looking at machines with internal combustion engines that comply with Stage V, hybrid technology and even new technologies such as green hydrogen.
Outside Germany, in “progressive” markets like the Netherlands and Scandinavia, governments are enshrining low emissions in regulations, in some cases supporting those strictures with subsidies to encourage uptake, he says.
“In Germany we don’t have that. It’s limited to certain projects, for example a hospital in the centre of a city, or tunnelling projects.”
Zeppelin Rental’s approach is to proactively work with customers and suppliers on key projects. “We are market leaders and want to move forward and we want to offer that to customers.”
“It’s not a must and its more expensive, and it’s a question of the project, the tender, the profitability and what they are able to pay for rental, but we encourage it where we can.”
Customers’ caution should be taken seriously, he says. “There are risks due to energy supply - concerns about electricity and infrastructure.
“The customer might have it in mind to change the project to an electric solution, but can they rely permanently on a supplier?”
To meet this need, products that support power supply, providing charging infrastructure and battery storage are a growing product line for Zeppelin Rental.
“It’s not the biggest part of the business but it’s a part,” Schrader tells IRN; and he adds that alternative power requirements are creating new customer channels.
“At Bauma I have been speaking, for example, to a city mayor who is looking for solutions for power cuts. We have some solutions to handle such things and we can speak to new types of customers, mayors, or municipalities. We’re also seeing demand from distribution centres from online retailers and local DIY centres.”
The events industry also demands alternative power options – and it’s a growing sector for other product types, he says.
“I love events – it was one of my projects some years ago to start the events business. I was convinced from beginning we had a chance to capture some of that market.
“A few years ago, we entered that business, with power solutions and lighting towers. Then the pandemic came, and we lost business for a couple of years – we were down to zero.
“This year there has been an explosion in demand; the same levels and higher than what we had before.”
“We have had discussions here at Bauma with agencies to potentially have us as key supplier, for music events and heavy metal festivals. I’m a little bit of a heavy metal fan.
“We’re becoming more and more known in events from music, to film, sports – bicycle races, that sort of thing. Events are about five per cent of our business – it is small but growing.”
For Zeppelin Rental’s core construction equipment business, the outlook remains positive, albeit shaded with caution.
“Before the war in Ukraine, Schrader tells IRN the outlook was optimistic; “now that’s more uncertain.”
At the same time, “In Germany we need reconstruction for highway bridges, fibreglass cable laying, gas projects and more, also housing although that is declining a little because of financial challenges, with interest rates going up.
“On the other hand, demand for 400,000 dwellings across Germany so there’s a need.”
Beyond Germany, Zeppelin Rental’s key markets including Austria, Czech, Slovakia, Denmark and Sweden are performing well.
“In those countries, it will take time to grow a business similar to what we have in Germany,” he tells IRN. To accelerate growth across all markets, the company is looking at acquisition opportunities.
“There are certain qualities we would look for, for example independent management, local market knowledge. We certainly see acquisitions as a big chance to grow the business.”
He says there are no immediate acquisition plans, but it’s on the company’s radar.
In the nearer term, despite his enthusiasm for Bauma, Schrader is bracing himself for the weekend, typically an opportunity for families and children to visit Bauma.
“Some have predicted that tomorrow and Sunday there will be fewer people here, but at the moment I can’t believe that.”"
14 December 2022,What climate pledges are being made in construction?,"With a couple of clicks of his computer keyboard, Marius Verwoerd, VP for Sustainability at Finnish mining equipment manufacturer Metso Outotec scrolls through a series of charts on the company website to show the carbon emissions.
In 2021, Metso produced 52,216 tonnes of carbon dioxide from its own operations, an increase of 14% from the 44,913 tonnes in 2020, but down 58% compared with 2019. This was mostly achieved, Verwoerd says, by switching energy sources from fossil fuels to renewables or renewable energy certificates where that isn’t possible.
That, he says, is keeping the company on track to meet its latest emissions reduction targets, set by the company in 2021, promising to halve CO2 output compared with 2019 levels and to ‘net zero’ by 2030.
Net zero is the point at which the amount of carbon emissions produced by the company will be so low it will be balanced out by the amount it removes from the atmosphere.
“Yes we are on track to reach our target,”Verwoerd says confidently. “We have quite a long history of setting climate related emissions targets in the company.
“We are also clear about what the next steps between now and 2030 will be. We have a company-wide roadmap for how we plan to achieve our target.”
And Metso is far from alone. More construction organisations than ever are signing up to ambitious climate pledges to reduce their carbon footprints as companies around the world face unprecedented pressure from customers, employees, shareholders and lenders to operate in a more environmentally sustainable manner.
An International Construction analysis of the sustainability reports produced by a selection of 50 of the world’s biggest contractors, construction equipment OEMs and rental companies, found that nearly all of them had made some sort of commitment to reducing emissions and improving their impact on the environment – see the box below for the full list.
Encouragingly, there are signs that these efforts are bearing fruit. Research from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), a UN-backed organisation which has become the gold standard in assessing corporate climate pledges, found that companies with approved targets collectively reduced direct emissions by 12% in 2020.
Even taking into account the effect of the Covid pandemic during this time, the organisation reported that SBTi companies have delivered “excess reductions in comparison to their peers within their countries.”
However, there are still big caveats.
At the COP27 climate change summit in Egypt this year, the UN climate science panel reported that global CO2 emissions are on track to increase by around 1% this year, making it even harder for the world to avoid disastrous levels of climate change.
Although much of the blame for this rests with world governments, the fact remains that many of the world’s biggest emitters have yet to sign up to a voluntary agreement.
Moreover, delegates heard that many of the corporate pledges which have been made are either not ambitious enough, or are not being implemented – leaving companies open to allegations of ‘greenwashing’.
“Despite [the] growing [number of] pledges of climate action, global emissions are at an all time high and they continue to rise,” UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres told the conference. “To avert a climate catastrophe, we need bold pledges but matched by concrete, measurable action.”
For a start, although many companies have pledged to cut emissions, fewer of these have agreed to become net zero within an agreed time frame. Of the 50 companies surveyed by International Construction, around half had published a specific commitment to become net zero. Moreover, there was a significant variation over the timescales by which the companies surveyed hoped to achieve net zero.
Just two – Metso Outotec and Canadian engineering company SNC Lavalin Group – stated an aim of becoming net zero by 2030. Swedish vehicle and equipment manufacturers Scania and Volvo Group, said that they aimed to become net zero by 2040, while another 15 explicitly said that they would become net zero by 2050 – the year by which the UN says global emissions must fall by almost 50% to keep global temperature rises to a 1.5ᵒC target.
A UN commission convened to assess the robustness of these corporate climate pledges, chaired by Catherine McKenna, a former Canadian minister of environment and climate change, found that even amongst those firms which had made a commitment to net zero, progress on emissions reduction was patchy and difficult to assess.
According to McKenna’s report, delivering on net zero requires three key measures.
Firstly, putting in place short, medium and long term plans to show how they will achieve their goal.
Secondly, focussing on reducing their own emissions as much as possible rather than buying carbon credits to offset their emissions.
Finally, addressing carbon emissions across their entire value chain – the ones produced by suppliers and customers – as well as the ones caused by their own operations.
“If you’re saying to the world ‘I am net zero’ then there is a price of admission,” McKenna told the conference. “You need to walk the talk. You need to deliver on it.”
One way in which many companies are attempting to put clear plans in place is by joining the SBTi, an initiative led by the UN Global Compact and involving a partnership of ‘green’ organisations and charities such as WWF, CDP and the World Resources Initiative.
The initiative works with businesses around the world to agree science-based target that limits a business’s global share of greenhouse gas emissions.
The initiative has quickly grown to become the gold standard for independently-verified corporate emissions targets with more than 4,000 businesses around the world already signed up, including 22 of those surveyed by International Construction.
Karl Downey, senior technical manager at the SBTi says that the organisation helps each individual company set meaningful emissions targets by assessing current emissions levels and plans to reduce them compared with those of industry peers.
Then, using a computer algorithm to work out how the proposed cuts would tie in with global emissions targets to keep warming to well below the 2ᵒC (or preferably 1.5ᵒC) above pre-industrial levels proposed in the Paris Climate Agreement.
Downey says that although the SBTi is unable to check whether companies are telling the truth about their emissions or sticking to their plans once they have set them, the initiative is important because it adds to the pressure corporates are facing to make meaningful changes to their operations.
“For the construction sector, the technology to enable companies to make these emissions cuts is already there,” Downey says. “The challenge we face is that the sector is so fragmented that we need to get lots of different individuals to each cut their emissions.”
Echoing McKenna’s second point, Downey says that the biggest problem his organisation comes up against in the construction sector when attempting to agree corporate climate pledges is the number of companies who propose that, rather than cutting their own carbon emissions, they plan to reduce their overall carbon footprint by investing in ventures such as renewable energy projects or tree planting - known as carbon offsets.
“We see a number of attempts at greenwashing but offsetting is definitely the biggest one,” Downey says.
“We are against using offsets as a way of meeting corporate targets, although we do say that of course companies can finance additional emissions reductions beyond their science-based target or net zero target.”
Some environmentalists go further, pointing out that tree planting events and the like have poor success rates and can even have a detrimental effect on the environments they are supposed to help.
“Carbon offsets mean climate sabotage,” Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International told the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021.
“They aren’t just a tool to greenwash climate inaction and delay the transformation we need, they’re also going to drive devastating land grabs in the Global South.”
Other ways companies attempt to manipulate their emissions targets, says SBTi’s Karl Downey, include choosing an atypical base year from which to measure their emissions reductions, or by attempting to make their emissions cuts sound bigger by calculating tonnes of CO2 emitted per US$1m of company sales.
“These figures can provide a useful way of looking at corporate emissions but overall we need to see total carbon emissions,” he says.
Claire Danamur, a sustainability analyst at ESG ratings agency EcoVadis, says that, although most large companies in the construction industry in Europe are capable of producing detailed and reliable information about the carbon emissions they produce through their own operations (scope 1 emissions) or the energy they buy from outside sources (scope 2).
Many face significant challenges when assessing scope 3 emissions - the greenhouse gasses produced by both the company’s suppliers and its customers. (In the case of equipment rental businesses, scope 3 emissions would include the carbon emitted by their machines when used by customers.)
“Some 20-50% of a building’s lifetime emissions take place during the construction phase,” Danamur says. “Every project is unique and involves a team of engineers, architects, consultants, suppliers and subcontractors that may not have worked together before.
“Furthermore, building materials are often sourced from global markets where labour and occupational health standards vary. This makes it challenging for global construction firms to account for all actors within their value chain.”
In the International Construction survey, only 20 of the 50 companies surveyed made any mention at all of scope 3 emissions at all in their climate pledges.
Downey says the SBTi is developing specific methodologies and guidance for some companies in the building sector which will require them to make greater scope 3 emissions cuts than average to account for a predicted 75% growth in the floor area of buildings between 2020 and 2050.
Back at Metso, Marius Verwoerd says that one of the ways his company aims to ensure it is working towards hitting its carbon reduction targets is by regularly publishing detailed data about a range of sustainability metrics including scope 1,2 and 3 emissions, the amount of water it uses and the amount of energy it consumes.
For president and CEO Pekka Vaurramo to receive his full share bonus in 2024, the Metso Outotec board has stipulated that one of the key performance metrics, carrying a weighting of 10%, is that the company must achieve its carbon emissions improvement target of reducing scope one and two CO2 output by 50% compared with 2019.
“In our company where sustainability is linked to our management’s renumeration and to our finance arrangements, as well as externally verified, we consider sustainability data as important as any other data in the company,” Verwoerd says.
“The more companies embed sustainability into their business models, and the more regulators ensure that regulations related to sustainability reporting push companies to be precise and open about their sustainability actions and data, the less likely ‘greenwashing’ will become.”
Yet with the wave of climate pledges made following the COP26 summit last year followed by a number of lawsuits about greenwashing in advertising campaigns, many firms are choosing not to publicise the details of their climate goals in an effort to avoid scrutiny and allegations of greenwashing.
A study of 1,200 companies by UK-based climate consultancy South Pole, found that although corporates are setting more net zero goals than ever before, with more science based goals to back them up and to more ambitious timelines, around a quarter said that they planned not to announce these targets to the public – a process it describes as ‘greenhushing.’
“More than ever we need the companies making progress on sustainability to inspire their peers and make a start,” says Renat Heuberger, CEO of South Pole. “This is impossible if progress is happening in silence.”
Critics also point out that the current voluntary system of emissions reporting and reduction includes no way to ensure that companies stick to the targets they have set themselves.
Even independent third party organisations like SBTi have faced criticism of potential conflicts of interest over the fact that they charge companies a $9,500 fee to assess their climate goals – funding which the SBTi’s Downey says makes up “only a small proportion of the organisation’s funding,” and about which it is “very transparent.”
“It’s tough to go and figure out who’s greenwashing and who’s not,” said Al Halvorsen, Vice President of ESG at Sunbelt Rentals, a subsidiary of the UK-based Ashtead Group, speaking at the Access, Lift & Handlers conference in Chicago, earlier this year. “There are companies that go out and set very aggressive goals, don’t reach their goal, and then five years later they set another aggressive goal.
“You look at the transparency of the company and if companies are honest in saying, ‘here are our challenges, here’s our performance’, and they don’t try to hide some of the faults that they have, I would say that would be a sign of somebody maybe who is not greenwashing. If you hear somebody making claims that they can’t or won’t back up – that would raise a flag to say, I wonder if that’s true or not.”
To combat this, the UN High Level Expert Group on Net Zero Emissions Commitments’ top recommendation is for governments around the world to introduce regulations and standards in areas including net zero pledges, transition plans and disclosures in order to ensure that companies are both consistent and transparent about their emissions.
“Voluntary schemes are not enough,” the UN’s Catherine McKenna said. “Regulation will be essential here, both to ensure that voluntary climate roadmaps are replaced by mandatory strategies and to level the playing field.
“If we are to avoid a future where our children are buying ‘net zero’ bacon between floods and fires, we must close the gap between the promises we hear and the action we need.”

12 December 2022,What are the stages of autonomy?,"Automation in construction is designed to produce higher production rates, improve project delivery times, as well as create better health and safety measures. A degree of automation – also known as machine control – has been in use in construction for decades.
Autonomous vehicles are operated by means of LiDAR sensors detecting obstacles in the surroundings, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and global positioning system (GPS) technology. This technology allows the vehicles to know their exact position on site, and a geofence is often used to prohibit the vehicles from operating off-site. A number of equipment manufacturers are including automation in the design of their vehicles, whilst construction technology companies are developing ways to enhance current fleets.
The human completely controls the equipment, be it a wheeled loader or an excavator. The human steers, brakes, and accelerates.
Under certain conditions, the machine controls either the steering or the vehicle speed, but not both simultaneously. At the same time, the operator performs all other aspects of driving and has full responsibility for monitoring the surrounding area and taking over if the assistance system fails to act appropriately.
Liebherr says that its new assistance systems for XPower large wheeled loaders increase comfort and safety in daily operation in a range of ways. The company says that one of its advantages is that they enable machine operators to concentrate more on operating their Liebherr wheel loader by removing additional distractions.
At this level, the machine can steer, accelerate and brake in certain circumstances. The operator will still need to perform tactical manoeuvres such as scanning for hazards.
The machine can manage most aspects of driving, including monitoring the environment. The system will request the operator to intervene when it encounters a scenario it can’t navigate, meaning the driver must still pay attention and be ready to take over at any time.
No human input or oversight is required except under select conditions defined by factors such as road type or geographic area (like poor weather or other unusual environments).
High automation allows companies to enhance safety in hazardous work environments, such as in the mining or quarrying industries, whilst also increasing productivity. Cat Command technologies by Caterpillar allow operators to use remote solutions, via onboard electronic and vision systems, to allow machines to be controlled without anyone in the cab.
The machine can operate on any road and in any conditions a human driver could negotiate. The system is navigated via an app or online system that will tell the machine what it should be doing. This level of automation is considered to be a long way off for construction.
In an interview with International Construction magazine, Trackunit CEO, Soeren Brogaard, said, “We are very far away from autonomous systems where AI can ultimately augment a human being… clearly, AI is coming. AI is an element that we all have to be part of. I think you’ll see it on expensive machines where each little component just starts getting more and more utility, so you cannot misuse it, or it cannot be of danger. But doing it at large construction sites with multiple systems; I wish it would happen in our lifetime, but I doubt it.”
To drive the development of autonomous transport solutions across the company, at the beginning of 2020, Volvo Group established the Volvo Autonomous Solutions business unit.
“Our approach is to start in a narrowly defined environment and build on the successes achieved there over time,” says Perjohan Rosdahl, Head of Off-Road at Volvo Autonomous Solutions. Rosdahl adds, “A perfect place for this is in quarries, which have clearly defined loading and unloading locations over generally short distances.”
The company’s autonomous and electrically powered load carrier TA15 uses GPS, lidar, radar and multiple sensors. Since the innovative vehicle does not require a driver, it comes without a cabin, enabling a completely new machine profile. According to Rosdahl, the next step could be the use of autonomous Volvo construction machines in underground mining and tunnels."
08 December 2022,Cat announces new 350 excavator,"The equipment manufacturing giant said the new machine is in line with its commitment to reducing greenhouse gases, with the potential to reduce fuel consumption by up to 13%.
The 350 has a Cat C9.3B engine, with net power of 308 kW, giving it the capacity to operate with buckets up to 3.2m3.
An auto dig boost automatically injects an 8% increase in power for better bucket penetration, which Cat says will result in shorter cycle times and greater payloads. To this Cat has added auto heavy lift, giving an 8% boost to lifting power.
The 350 also promises 1,000-hour oil and filter service intervals, plus a 3,000-hour replacement interval (a 50% increase over the previous model), reducing downtime.
On-board technology
The excavator also comes with a wide range of on-board technology, including a 2D Grade system, which indicates depth and slope, plus alerting operators to increase efficiency.
Other tech enhancements include Grade, Swing and Lift Assist, as well as 2D E-Fence, ensuring the machine only works within operator-defined parameters.
Cat also says it has upgraded the operator experience with the 350 excavator, offering a programmable joystick, a high-resolution touchscreen monitor with jog dial.
A choice of deluxe or premium cabs is available, with a heated or heated and ventilated seat respectively.
Cat Stick Steer is an option on the 350, which operators can switch to at the touch of a button.
Brian Abbott, Caterpillar global product manager for large hydraulic excavators, said, “Caterpillar is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while helping our customers meet their climate-related objectives.”"
07 December 2022,It’ll be the biggest ConExpo-Con/Agg ever,"It’s official: ConExpo-Con/Agg, the biggest trade show in North America, is getting even bigger.
The Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), the organizers of the every-three-years event, has announced that all available exhibit space for the upcoming show has been sold out, guaranteeing the 2023 edition will be the biggest ConExpo in history.
“The addition of the new West Hall and Diamond Lot at the Las Vegas Convention Center gave us, and our exhibitors, a number of new opportunities to show how we are taking the construction industry to the next level,” said ConExpo-Con/Agg Show Director Dana Wuesthoff.
“Now at 2.8 million sq. ft. of exhibits, there’s more for construction pros to see than ever before.”
Nearly 5% bigger than the record set in 2020, ConExpo-Con/Agg will feature 1800 exhibitors and 150 education sessions during its run from March 14-18, 2023.
Despite being the largest ConExpo ever, AEM noted that recent additions to the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) will make it the easiest to get around as well. Beneath the entire LVCC campus runs the Convention Center Loop, an underground transportation system designed by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. that transports convention attendees throughout the campus in under two minutes in Tesla vehicles, free of charge.
AEM said attendee registrations were also on strong pace, as pre-registrations are nearly double what they were at the same time for the 2020 show.
“This is the event that construction professionals, especially those making company-level decisions, and those needing professional development hours, can’t miss,” said Caterpillar Senior Vice President Phil Kelliher, who is ConExpo-Con/Agg show chair. “Seeing the new equipment and techniques on a screen doesn’t compare to seeing it all in person.
“At the show, you can see the equipment, ask questions of the manufacturers themselves, and really understand what the equipment and education can do for your career and business.”
Registration for ConExpo-ConAgg the International Fluid Power Exposition (IFPE) show held in conjunction with ConExpo-Con/Agg, is currently 30% off with code MEDIA30. AEM advises that construction and fluid power professionals should get their badges before Jan. 6, 2023, to get that discount and have a better pick of hotel accommodations.

29 November 2022,Caterpillar’s new hydraulic excavators,"Caterpillar has released two new hydraulic excavator models which are both said to feature more powerful engines and increased productivity.
The new Cat 340 Hydraulic Excavator has a more powerful engine, wider track, and 7.5-ton counterweight to increase productivity by 10% over the 2020 model Cat 336.
Cat says that the new excavator’s reinforced structures are able to provide long-term durability and make it optimum for harsh digging, truck loading, and hammer applications.
“The 340 reaches a new level of performance,” said Brian Abbott, Caterpillar’s global product manager for large hydraulic excavators. “Our additions make the machine more productive and stable with larger work tools, giving contractors more flexibility to complete a wider range of projects.”
Built for bigger jobs, the Cat 352 Hydraulic Excavator is said to combine more power and a heavier counterweight to work with larger tools.
The 352 Excavator offers a choice of fixed or variable gauge undercarriage. The variable gauge undercarriage retracts to a 2390-mm (7-ft, 10-in) width, making it easier to transport. When expanded, it is 150 mm (6 in) wider than the fixed gauge undercarriage for greater stability.
The company adds that the standard Cat Grade technology boosts excavator productivity by up to 45%. Cat 2D Grade indicates depth and slope on the in-cab monitor with auditory alerts, while standard Cat Grade Assist allows the excavator to stay on grade with single-lever digging.
Abbott adds that the 352 “can be equipped with high-capacity buckets to dig and load tons of material in fewer passes or large hammers to work in demanding quarry applications.”"
23 November 2022,Caterpillar release cloud-based system to boost performance,"Finning, dealer of Caterpillar machines and equipment in the UK and Ireland, is encouraging its customers to sign up for the new Cat Productivity platform, a cloud-based system designed to gather and analyse a range of machine data that will boost machine performance and productivity.
The company says that customers will be able to track how much time their machines spend loading, hauling, and dumping and how work is progressing whether they are on-site or not.
Cat Productivity can be accessed from any internet device and can be used for mixed fleets of Cat and non-Cat machines.
The platform can also gather accurate data from multiple jobsites and machines into one platform on everything from tonnes per hour, cycles per hour, load count by site or asset, working vs. idle hours and machine fuel burn.
Tom Barker, performance solutions consultant for Finning UK and Ireland, said, “The Cat Productivity platform gives customers the information they need to implement the right changes to improve site productivity by lowering the cost per ton through measures such as reducing idle time, reducing fuel monitor material tracking, and track individual assets to ensure they are optimally positioned to reduce cycle time.
“We already have a number of customers utilising the platform and have had some great feedback from them because it’s so easy to use and gives them all the information they need in one place, both for reporting purposes to their client and to implement effective changes which add up to big improvements in productivity.”"
23 November 2022,Cat’s new Stage V gen set,"Caterpillar has launched the 115 kVA Cat XQP115 generator set, which meets European Union (EU) Stage V emission standards and offers a number of rental friendly features.
Designed and tested by Caterpillar, the Cat XQP115 set is the third in a series of compact mobile power solutions from 115 to 310 kVA that meet the 90% reduction in nitrogen oxides when compared with the Stage IIIA standard, as well as other changes specified by Stage V standards.
Additionally, the series offers an average of 20% higher peak power in prime operation than the previous Stage IIIA Cat XQP models serving this power range.
“The Cat XQP115 offers versatility and flexibility by easily switching between 50 and 60 Hz and across a range of voltages, enabling it to accommodate a wide range of load requirements for applications in manufacturing, oil and gas, construction, mining, and other industries,” a statement from the OEM confirmed.
Along with Cat’s other Stage V mobile power solutions, it is also said to offer numerous features for rental applications, including the XQCP digital control panel, which provides all generator set controls and system indicators in a single, easy-to-access interface.
The gen sets are designed with a dual-wall fuel tank with an open bund that helps to protect the environment by containing spills, Cat said, while coastal insulation protection (CIP) enables operation in harsh conditions.
“Their wide, impact-absorbing base frames, customer connections isolated from circuit breakers, and optional CEE sockets are designed to facilitate transportation, set-up and use. Forklift pockets, dragging points, and a lifting arch help to simplify loading, unloading, and placement around the worksite.”
The Cat XQP115 is equipped with subscription-based Cat Connect technology to give operators insights that manage costs and reduce risks. The telematics send real-time information on fuel level, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) level, battery voltage, and run status, and connected assets support peak operation with timely insights that help customers better control costs, improve performance and reduce risks.
In addition, Cat mobile generator sets meeting EU Stage V emission standards can use up to 100% hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), a renewable diesel fuel meeting EN15940.
Tom Caldwell, global general manager for electric power rental solutions at Caterpillar, said; “The addition of the Cat XQP115 to our portfolio of mobile power solutions that meet EU Stage V emission standards enables users to precisely select the package that meets their power needs.”

22 November 2022,‘Significant milestone’ for Cat’s battery electric mining truck,"Caterpillar says that it has successfully demonstrated its first battery electric 793 large mining truck with support from key mining customers participating in the company’s Early Learner program.
Participants of the program with definitive electrification agreements include BHP, Freeport-McMoRan, Newmont Corporation, Rio Tinto and Teck Resources Limited. These customers witnessed a live demonstration of Caterpillar’s prototype battery truck on a 7km (4.3 mile) course.
During the event, Caterpillar monitored over 1,100 data channels, gathering 110,000 data points per second, to validate simulation and engineering modeling capabilities.
Fully loaded to its rated capacity, the truck achieved a top speed of 60 km/h (37.3 mph). The loaded truck travelled 1km (0.62 mile) up a 10% grade at 12km/h (7.5 mph). The truck also performed a 1km (0.62 mile) run on a 10% downhill grade, capturing the energy that would normally be lost to heat and regenerating that energy to the battery. Upon completing the entire run, the truck maintained enough battery energy to perform additional complete cycles.
“Our global team came together to develop this battery truck at an accelerated pace to help our customers meet their sustainability commitments,” said Resource Industries Group President Denise Johnson. “This demonstration is a significant milestone, and we are excited for these trucks to get to work at customers’ sites around the world in the near future.”
The prototype truck was built at Caterpillar’s Tucson Proving Ground in Arizona. Caterpillar is investing to transform the proving ground into a working, sustainable ‘mine site of the future’ by installing and utilising a variety of renewable energy sources. The objective is to implement the same sustainable solutions mining companies will use at their own operations to learn first-hand what it takes to run an electrified mine site and effectively support customers through the changes.
As part of the site transformation, the company will install the latest advancements in sustainability technology, including green hydrogen production, natural gas and 100% hydrogen reciprocating engine power generation, fuel cell power generation and expanded energy storage systems. The site will also leverage a variety of renewable power sources, including wind, solar and hydrogen, capable of powering the facility and its products as they become electrified."
14 November 2022,Caterpillar expands remote control offering,"Caterpillar says that its 349, 352, 374 and 395 large excavators in the 40 to 95 tonne category can now be equipped with Cat Command for Excavating.
Previously available on the 320 to 340 models, the remote-control system is said to remove operators from potentially hazardous jobsite conditions and reduce potential safety risks from climbing on and off machines.
The Cat Command station allows for non-line-of-sight remote control, where users can comfortably control all basic machine functions like digging, lifting, and tracking.
Caterpillar says that the technology can help improve machine productivity on various projects like operating in unstable underfoot conditions, brownfields, shore work, and demolition.
It also allows production to restart immediately following disruptive processes such as blasting in quarry applications.
By removing the operator from the cab, Caterpillar believes that the Command for Excavating technology offers a solution to workforce shortages and training advantages for newer operators.
It also opens opportunities to those with physical limitations that prevent them from climbing into the equipment, attracting a new generation of workers, and increasing the longevity of experienced operators.
