17 May 2023,New Cat 836 Landfill Compactor,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,new-cat-836-landfill-compactor_5976.htm","The new Cat 836 Landfill Compactor boasts engineering upgrades to the axles and transmission to increase durability of the heavy-duty main structures that support multiple life cycles. New standard technologies also increase machine efficiency by allowing the operator to meet compaction targets in fewer passes to save on fuel. The Cat torque converter with lock-up clutch eliminates torque converter losses while lowering system heat and transfers more power to the ground for improved traction. Its advanced productivity electronic control system (APECS) transmission control helps the compactor to achieve greater momentum on grades and delivers fuel savings by carrying momentum through shift points. Two configuration options for the Cat C18 engine powering the 836 allow the compactor to meet local emissions regulation requirements around the world. Improved radiator air inlet door sealing and carry over pressure hood enclosure help to reduce the need for engine compartment cleanout. Helping to facilitate maintenance planning, data captured alerts key personnel to the remaining useful life of the engine air filter. Advanced compaction technologies Cat Compact technologies combine advanced compaction measurement, in-cab guidance and reporting, so compaction targets are met quickly, uniformly and in fewer passes to save on fuel. The system includes a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver on top of the 836 and mapping display inside the cab. Standard Cat Compact with Pass Mapping delivers high-accuracy pass counting, allowing operators to monitor areas of coverage and number of passes on the 10-inch display. Optional Compact Elevation Mapping combines both pass counting and elevation monitoring of slopes to plan, control layer thicknesses and achieve better density.

The all-new E-generation Volvo R60 rigid hauler is the perfect partner for heavy-duty quarrying and mining, reckons its maker. Built for markets with tier 2-compliant engines and based on the R100E model, the R60 packs a higher payload than the D-generation model it replaces, along with a durable design and new comfort and safety-enhancing features – enabling it to move more for less with every cycle. Big on efficiency Drew Watson, Global Product Manager for the Volvo R60 at Volvo CE explained, “The Volvo R60 offers a 55-tonne payload and body volume of 36m<sup>3</sup>, enabled by a V-shaped body ensuring optimum load retention and minimal material carry-back. The rigid hauler is a perfect match for a 90-tonne excavator and meets the industry standard of 10/10/20 where it can take 10% overload for 10% of the time but should not exceed 20%. “To help operators haul the optimum amount of material, an optional On-Board Weighing system provides real-time payload insight to the hauler operator via the on-board display, and can predict the 10/10/20 payload,” Drew added. Contributing to speedy cycle times, the drivetrain combines high torque capability and high drive axle multiplication to deliver the traction force needed to take on the steepest site gradients. Not only is it productive, but the Volvo R60 is also fuel efficient. Thanks to Volvo Dynamic Shift Control, gear selection automatically adapts to varying conditions, whilst Eco mode enables the hauler to default to the most efficient gear shifting schedule. In addition, auto engine-idle shut-down eliminates unnecessary fuel consumption and engine wear. The rigid hauler is available with the Volvo CareTrack telematics system to enable remote machine monitoring and help boost efficiency even further. What’s more, customers can gain recommendations on the optimum fleet configuration and site set-up from their Volvo dealer, with the support of Volvo Site Simulation. Strong and durable Designed to deliver high uptime and low operating costs, Volvo says the R60 is built to last with a 60,000-hour life frame and a list of features that contribute to long-lasting performance and component life, including a low centre of gravity and balanced weight distribution to provide rock-solid stability and spread the impact of loads and stresses across the machine; a high-strength, flexible chassis and responsive MacPherson strut with lower wishbone connection to absorb shocks and vibrations and improve the operator ride; a V-shaped body, manufactured from high impact and high abrasion resistant steel, with minimal number of panels and welds; and neutral coast inhibitor and engine overspeed protection to further minimise wear. Servicing of the R60 is required every 500 hours and can be completed swiftly thanks to a straightforward machine design that includes grouped maintenance points located within easy reach either from the ground or the service platform, as well as common-sized bearings throughout. On-board diagnostics provide insights into system pressures and temperatures, and fault reporting to facilitate and speed-up troubleshooting. Comfortably productive Operators can enter the cab from both sides using anti-slip steps and walkways. The cab is now pressurised, Roll/Fall-OverProtective Structure-certified (ROPS/FOPS) and features a left-positioned operator station to aid safe passing. Volvo Smart View is an added option to improve visibility even further with a 360-degree birds-eye view of the work zone. Ergonomically positioned displays, responsive fingertip controls and low-effort steering combine to make operation effortless. The adjustable air-suspended seat and a Bluetooth-enabled audio system add to operator comfort. The Volvo R60 is equipped with two retardation systems to keep a steady speed and facilitate machine navigation when going downhill, reducing the need for operator input. When manually selected, the transmission retarder slows the drivetrain to limit wheel lock-up, particularly useful on steep declines or in wet conditions. The modulating braking retarder can be automatically activated when the operator’s foot is off the accelerator to maintain a gear selected constant engine speed. What’s more, fail-safe braking and secondary steering systems add to jobsite safety. "
16 May 2023,Komatsu excavator with hydrogen fuel cell,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,komatsu-excavator-with-hydrogen-fuel-cell_5973.htm","Komatsu has developed a new concept medium-sized hydraulic excavator that combines a hydrogen fuel cell and Komatsu-developed key components to achieve carbon neutrality at workplaces of construction equipment. By advancing the PoC (Proof of Concept) tests it started in May 2023, Komatsu has accelerated its efforts to embark on the commercial production of medium-sized and large construction equipment powered by hydrogen fuel cells in the near future. In its mid-term management plan, Komatsu committed to minimising environmental impact throughout its business, targeting a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions from use of its products and production of its equipment by 2030 (compared to 2010 levels) and a challenge target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. To help its customers achieve carbon neutrality, Komatsu has been providing a variety of products, services, and solutions that reduce environmental impact, such as hybrid hydraulic excavators and electric mini excavators. Komatsu is also engaged in research and development to provide products equipped with new power sources. For the new concept machine, Komatsu adopted a hydrogen fuel cell system and hydrogen tank, which were produced by Toyota Motor Corporation, on Komatsu’s medium-sized hydraulic excavator. In addition to Komatsu’s control technology, the combination of Toyota’s hydrogen fuel cell system and Komatsu key components, Komatsu is working towards zero exhaust emissions and a significant reduction in noise and vibration, while delivering the same powerful digging performance and high operability as engine-driven excavators. Medium-sized and large construction equipment both require a power source with higher energy density than that of small construction equipment, which has led to the move to electrification with batteries. Because hydrogen has a higher energy density and can be refuelled in a shorter time than is required for recharging batteries, Komatsu has been advancing its R&D efforts as a promising electrification choice for medium-sized and large models. To contribute to realising a hydrogen society and carbon neutrality, Komatsu will continue its efforts towards the commercial production of medium-sized and large construction machinery equipped with hydrogen fuel cells by conducting PoC tests of this new concept machine.

Remote Flash makes sure the machine is working with the latest software, updated at a time convenient to the production schedule.  "
10 May 2023,New 6t mini-excavators from Develon,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,new-6t-miniexcavators-from-develon_5960.htm","Develon (formerly known as Doosan Construction Equipment) has launched new, 6-tonne DX62R-7 and DX63-7 Stage 5 mini-excavators, continuing the roll out of the next-generation of machines from the company, with a new shared global styling design. The new mini-excavators are designed to offer maximum performance, optimum stability, increased versatility, enhanced operator comfort, controllability, durability, ease of maintenance and serviceability. The DX62R-7 and DX63-7 are ideal for work in confined spaces on projects in construction, landscaping, utilities, rental, agriculture, recycling, waste and many other areas. Both models are powered by the new D24 Stage 5-compliant diesel engine providing 44.3kW (59.4hp) of power. Despite offering an 8% increased torque of 26.5kgm/rpm, the D24 engine still provides a 7% decrease in engine fuel consumption.   The DX62R-7 and DX63-7 utilise a Load Sensing System based around a new Main Control Valve resulting in a longer spool stroke for improved controllability and superior working efficiency/performance compared to the previous models they replace. This results from a significant reduction in energy wastage and an over 30% decrease in pressure losses, resulting in an increased system pressure of 275bar, better fuel efficiency and lower operating costs. Both machines offer a high auxiliary flow of 90 l/min to enhance work with attachments. The flow capacity can be monitored on the Develon Smart 8-inch touchscreen in 10 steps and controlled using the thumbwheel on the joystick. This flexibility is combined with an excellent traction force, travel speeds, lifting capacities and digging forces, together providing superior working performance, particularly for trenching and lifting work. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/DEVELON-DX63-application_edit1.jpg"" width=""800""/> In the cab The new cab on the DX62R-7 and DX63-7 is very roomy for this size of machine and features a full glass entry door to maximize operator visibility on this side of the machine from inside the cab. A rear-view camera is optional and the high luminance LED work lamps (which are standard) on the cab further enhance visibility and safety. The enhanced HVAC system provides more nozzles to direct warming and cooling air, including both front and rear pillar nozzles that together help to improve the system performance. Larger nozzles are also used to ensure direct and sufficient airflow for operators and manual adjustment of the opening/closing of the nozzles is also possible. The HVAC system and the DAB Audio can be controlled through the 8-inch touchscreen and the feed from the optional rear view camera can be displayed on the latter. The monitor also shows the flow rate setting for the 10-step control system using the thumbwheel joystick. Dozer lever control Using the dozer lever, the operator can select between low and high speed for the levelling blade hydraulics. Travel speed can also be selected by using the travel selector button on the dozer lever. When hydraulic oil pressure rises due to going up a slope while driving in the high speed mode, the travel speed auto-shift valve automatically resets the travel speed to low, to enhance the operator’s driving convenience and to reduce machine stress. The dozer control also provides a new blade floating function - pushing the dozer lever all the way forward puts the lever into the detent position and leaves the dozer blade in a ‘float’ position. Customers can also choose the optional Dozer lock function, which prevents dozer blade creep. If the machine has the optional blade lock valve installed, the floating function will not work when the lever is in the detent position. The DX62R-7 and DX63-7 feature a new two-part bonnet cover, with fully opening centre and side segments giving easy access for maintenance work compared to the previous generation machines. The cleverly designed mesh bonnet cover prevents dirt ingress. There are two fuse boxes in the cab on the left-hand side of the heater box. The positioning of the fuses under the cab seat and next to the heater box ensure it is easy to remove a bracket, further simplifying maintenance work. The DX62R-7 and DX63-7 mini-excavators have the latest Develon Fleet Management TMS 3.0 Cellular system installed as standard, which provides a telematics management system for the excavators, by collecting data from sensors on the machines.

09 May 2023,Finning seals partnership with British Steel,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,finning-seals-partnership-with-british-steel_5959.htm","Finning UK & Ireland has forged a relationship with British Steel after supporting the company in replacing its hot works Cat fleet through a combination of rebuilds, rentals and on-site support. Over the past 12 months Finning has worked alongside the British Steel team at their Scunthorpe steelworks site after discussions began on how best to manage the machines that were coming to the end of their operational life. The team needed to work within a tight timescale and budget to ensure operations at the British Steel site weren’t impacted by machine downtime. The solution recommended by Finning included three rebuilt machines – a Cat 988K large wheel loader and two Cat 771D trucks. In addition, British Steel purchased four used Cat machines – one Cat 972 and two Cat 980M wheel loaders, plus a Cat 730 haul truck. The combined support package also included the long-term rental of two Cat 745 ADTs and a Cat 352 and 336 excavator to help British Steel meet demand on site while its assets were being refurbished, while three Finning expert engineers had a permanent presence on site providing operational support throughout the rebuild process.  Ben Jarzyna, Product Support Account Manager at Finning, said the hostile environment these machines operate in moving molten slag also meant they had to be specially adapted by the Finning team. “These are full machine rebuilds which are done to a Cat certified standard but converted to hot work with blast proof glass, fire retardant oil, fire sleeves and fire repression systems. As a 24-hour operation with such heavy use, not surprisingly British Steel also takes advantage of our warranty packages to maintain and service their machines so there’s minimal downtime.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""563"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/f758b941-fefe-edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Customers choosing a machine rebuild option can demonstrate their commitment to improving sustainability practices across their operations. Rebuilt machines offer significant reductions in carbon emissions and resource usage compared to the manufacture of new machines. Customers also typically save around 55-60% on the cost compared with buying a new machine, which can be significant across an annual Capex spend.  Ben added, “The tailor-made solution we have been able to find for British Steel fits their budget and has been really successful so far, as we’ve been able to give them machines and technology which are better suited to their needs and ones which they are familiar with operating.” Mark Ding, Workshop Services, Plant Infrastructure and Assets Manager for British Steel said, “The recommendation to consider rebuilds and rental machines not only met our commercial needs but has helped us improve our environmental performance. Our machines are subjected to extreme temperatures so suffer considerable wear and tear, but as a 24-hour operation minimising downtime of these assets is essential. “A significant part of the success of this fleet management programme has been access to the expertise of the Finning service engineers, whose in-depth knowledge of these machines has proved invaluable in ensuring our fleet remains operational and productive,” Mark revealed.

26 April 2023,Carmac kits out Hitachi excavators,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,carmac-kits-out-hitachi-excavators_5941.htm","Carmac Building and Civil Engineering Ltd has opted to have every new Hitachi Zaxis-7 excavator fitted with market-leading 3D machine control and special attachment solutions provided by Hitachi Connected Technology (HCT). This service is supplied by Hitachi Construction Machinery UK’s (HCMUK) dedicated production facility in the North East.   To date, the Finedon-based contractor has selected Leica Geosystems’ 3D machine control and the engcon tilt-rotator to be installed on its new ZX130LCN-7s and ZX210LC-7s. This work is carried out by HCMUK’s manufacturer-trained engineers to ensure that the installations are of the highest standard, as well as supported by both HCT and the manufacturer. “As a supplier to the housebuilding market, we’ve always aimed to be an early adopter in the use of technology to make us more efficient, productive and safe,” explained Carmac Director Colm Kilroy. “HCT has made it easy for us to implement this across the business, due to its in-depth knowledge, expertise and range of products. It’s an all-encompassing service – a one-stop shop for all our needs. When a new machine arrives on site, it is fully kitted out and ready to go. And we also benefit from HCMUK’s great service – we just pick up the phone and they can resolve any issues.” Carmac had Leica Geosystems’ 3D machine control fitted on a trial basis to two of its Zaxis-7 excavators that were working on a large housebuilding site in January 2022. “We found massive productivity benefits, as well as improvements to efficiency and safety,” explained Colm. In addition, the Leica Geosystems equipment enabled us to take a more predictive approach by tackling problems before they occurred. The benefits of 3D machine control became clear while working on the roads and sewers, as well as the foundations and external drains for the housing plots.” Carmac opted for Leica Geosystems because of the simplicity and user-friendliness of the programme. “The flexibility is the biggest benefit as we can change our plans on a daily basis – with less downtime – and the operators are able to carry out their work without the need for tracking or moving around,” added Colm. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/9J6A0171_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/>Safety first Two of Carmac’s most loyal and experienced operators, Jim Lonergan and Gary Draper, have worked with every generation of Hitachi Zaxis machine, from the -1 to -7 series. In addition, they have 35 and 38 years’ operating experience respectively. “The Leica Geosystems machine control is sheer genius and the technology speeds up the process so much,” said Jim. “It saves me time, because I can check all the levels and angles, and I don’t have to rely on anyone with a laser. I can also see the model on the monitor screen and hear the alert when I am digging to certain levels.” “The machine control system is a great piece of kit,” explained Gary. “I don’t have to wait for engineers now that I can be left alone, safe in the knowledge that there’s nobody working around the machine. For each phase of the project, the model is already there on my monitor and I am able to work away.”   Similarly, Carmac tested engcon tilt-rotators on three of its Hitachi models on various activities across the whole site. “We immediately saw how beneficial these were around the plots and on piling jobs, as well as for the ponds and roads,” said Colm. “In addition, they reduce the need for people to work near the machine and therefore are well worth the investment.”   “The tilt-rotator is very good, as it enables me to dig at different angles from one position – without having to move,” added Jim. “It’s easy to work with as all the angles and tilts come up on the screen, which means that I can still ensure that everything’s level – irrespective of the machine’s position. It’s perfect and working well.” Fellow operator Gary agreed. “The tilt-rotator is so convenient and easy to use. I can save time by not having to move around the site as much when digging out sewers and levelling stone ready for tarmac on the roads. The integrated gripper is also a useful attachment for grabbing tree stumps and undergrowth.” "
25 April 2023,Topcon streamlines nuclear power plant constructio...,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,topcon-streamlines-nuclear-power-plant-construction_5940.htm","In the UK we currently generate around 15 to 20% of our electricity from nuclear energy. To support the UK Government commitment to reach Net Zero emissions by 2050, Hinkley Point C in Somerset is under construction. This is the first new nuclear power station to be built in the UK in over 20 years and will provide low-carbon electricity for around 6 million homes. The electricity generated by its two EPR reactors will offset 9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or 600 million tonnes over its 60-year lifespan. As part of the project, Balfour Beatty is responsible for delivering the complex marine and tunnelling works, and constructing the structures for the critical infrastructure needed to supply cooling water to the power station. This project involves the construction of three tunnels under the Bristol Channel, with offshore concrete heads allowing sea water to pass into the tunnels. Building on its well-established partnership with Topcon, Balfour Beatty used the Topcon ClearEdge3D Verity software system to ensure that a key part of the project was completed accurately, on time and on budget. Working within tight tolerances  Through the delivery stages from design to offshore execution, precision was vital with very tight construction tolerances required. Once complete, the system will be connected to the seabed via vertical shafts, capped with intake and outfall heads. The intake structures are 44m long, which is roughly the length of four double-decker buses, and around 8m high, weighing more than 5,000 tonnes each. The structures were constructed at a purpose-built facility at Balfour Beatty’s site in Avonmouth, Bristol. Large steel alignment frames were then installed on top of the heads to enable future lifting and piling operations. Lifting lugs were cast into the reinforced concrete heads and these were then matched against bespoke handling frames. The accuracy of the fit was critical due to the 5mm tolerance available for alignment, ultimately allowing for the installation of the lifting pins and the subsequent safe offshore lifts. Tom Bush, Digital Project Delivery Coordinator at Balfour Beatty explained, “It’s no surprise that using cranes to rotate and position the large fabricated structures on to the concrete heads is an incredibly challenging task, and we didn’t have any room for error. While we were constructing the concrete heads, fabricators were building the alignment frames. With such a small tolerance on either side of the lifting lugs, we needed to ensure the data and measurements we were giving were accurate – with Topcon’s ClearEdge3D Verity software, we were able to do that.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""588"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/Image 2.JPG"" width=""800""/> Verification of works  The team used Topcon’s ClearEdge3D Verity software, which rapidly compares point cloud data with design and fabrication models for verification of work. Balfour Beatty used the software to compare real-time data being supplied by the survey team on-site against initial drawings, to ensure the lifting lugs were aligned with the tolerance available. Inaccuracies were discovered during the first comparisons, and so changes were fed back to the fabricators and rectified early on. Topcon’s software was also used to run several scenarios and create a digitally accurate approach that saved Balfour Beatty time and money, as well as strengthening health and safety precautions. The software translated data collected on-site into a digital model, providing accurate demonstrations of the rotations and twists of the installed lifting lugs on each of the heads, with immediate access to the latest data and comprehensive digital display models helping to streamline the process. Tom Bush continued, “Being able accurately verify the position of each individual lifting lug on each of the concrete heads through Verity allowed us to provide detailed as-built information, within a short period of time and remove the risk of expensive or time-consuming errors taking place when it came to fabricating and fitting the alignment frames. This was key to enable the project to keep on programme.” Adam Box, Business Development Manager for Vertical Construction at Topcon Positioning Europe said, “Balfour Beatty had quite the task at hand with this project but, thanks to the Verity software, they’ve been able to verify the work carried out at every stage of the process and ensure a success when it came to installing the frames to the heads. We worked closely with the Balfour Beatty team to ensure the software was being used to its full potential, to help reduce the risks of timely and costly errors taking place, and to deliver the project on time.” "

This, alongside the company’s investment in a state-of-the-art range of plug-in electric products, demonstrates its commitment to pursuing net-zero. Customers will experience minimal disruption, with the move already taken into account when planning 2023 volumes. Production availability for Revotruck is set to be announced over the coming months. Modern and sustainable Heath Davies, General Manager at Mecalac Construction Equipment UK commented, “As a global leader in the design and manufacture of compact machinery, we’re committed to investing in our future. In the past few months alone, we’ve revealed an increase to our UK production capability with Revotruck, and ED6 6-tonne electric dumper, demonstrating our commitment to embracing alternative fuels and decarbonising the sector. “However, to maintain this progress, it’s important that we have the right facilities and processes in place,"" Heath continued. ""Whilst our new UK headquarters is just a move a few miles away, the new facility is modern, sustainable, purposely designed for the change in our product mix and therefore perfectly suited to our future manufacturing operations. While we’ve been located in Prologis Park for many years, the site no longer fits our requirements. Embracing a new chapter in our journey will enable us to support the introduction of new model additions, while maintaining Groupe Mecalac’s commitment to UK manufacturing,” Heath Davies concluded. "
12 April 2023,New Cat rotary cutters,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,new-cat-rotary-cutters_5918.htm","According to Caterpillar, its Rotary Cutters for excavators offer high production in hard material for various applications like trenching and demolition. With controlled breaking and high precision, rotary cutters are ideal for working in confined or urban areas. Rotary cutters can be used in sensitive areas such as neighbourhoods or hospitals, since they produce a lower decibel of sound compared to other breaking tools. New Cat RC20 (1,340kg) and RC30 (2,340kg) models are available to be used with pin-on, S-type, Cat pin grabber or CW couplers. Rotary cutters are compatible with Cat hydro-mechanical work tool brackets, which allow operators to move more smoothly from one task to the next. For space constricting jobs, the rotary cutter can be manually turned either 90 or 270 degrees. Adding an optional hydraulic lines kit, the rotary cutter can be turned up to 180 degrees for cleaning narrow trenches or working away from the machine to help get increased productivity. Ideal for dredging applications, the rotary cutter can be submerged in water without modifications to the tool, says Caterpillar. The direct drive motor offers high torque, production and performance to help operators get the job done faster. With less space between the drums, operators can build narrower trenches while also burning less fuel. Rotary cutter picks are easily replaced with a simple tool and can be switched out quickly. Maintenance panels offer quick and easy access. Mechanical seals help to lock in grease and keep dust out to go longer between servicing. Rotary cutters break up material more to help put less wear and tear on buckets. Operators can track their entire fleet of attachments and machines from one source. Attachments with asset tracking can be viewed within VisionLink alongside Product Link subscribed equipment. Attachments with an asset tracker send an alert if they leave an easy-to-setup site boundary to help keep tools more secure. "

04 April 2023,Terex recycling plant installed at Collard Group,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,terex-recycling-plant-installed-at-collard-group_5896.htm","Collard Group, a Reading-based firm involved in recycling and waste management, has chosen Terex Recycling Systems plant to increase the processing capacity of its site and recover cleaner products of higher value, whilst not adding to the manual labour requirements. Initially intended to be a plant upgrade, the Collard Group opted for a full plant installation after being pleased with the first phase of the install. The plant, which is the first Terex Recycling Systems installation, was specifically tailored to suit Collard Group’s site and the material which would be fed into it. Together with their distributor Molson Green, Terex Recycling Systems developed a process which incorporated advanced mechanical separation that would increase Collard Group’s processing capacity and recover products of a higher purity than what was previously achieved. The team worked within restricted space and constraints of fitting the plant inside and around the existing building, all whilst planning the installation around Collard Group’s site works, that included the erection of a new building. Thomas McKiver, Sales Director, Molson Green said, “We are delighted to have sold and installed Terex Recycling Systems' first plant to the Collard Group. This plant will help them achieve their desired targets of increasing processing capacity and to recover greater percentages of cleaner recycling products, thus diverting more material from landfill.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/Terex Recycling Systems Plant - Coll.jpg"" width=""800""/> How it works The process starts with skip material being loaded into a Waste Feeder and conveyed to a Combi Screen, which separates into four size fractions using a combination of 3D and Flip-Flow screening (0-10mm, 10-50mm, 50-100mm and +100mm). Over-Band Magnets recover ferrous metals from 0-10mm, 10-50mm and 50-100mm, and Air Separators remove light material from 10-50mm and 50-100mm. A Manual Quality Control Picking Station has operators working to remove any remaining contaminants from the 10-100mm heavy fraction. Following this, an Eddy Current Separator recovers non-ferrous metal from the 10-100mm heavy fraction. Another Manual Picking Station has operators recovering materials such as wood, card, and plastic from the +100mm, and an Over-Band Magnet recovers ferrous metal. Finally, an Air Separator removes light material from the +100mm. The outcome is a highly efficient plant that is processing skip waste – a mixture of Commercial and Industrial (C&I) and Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste – to produce 0-10mm fines, ferrous metals, clean 10-100mm heavy fraction (inert), non-ferrous metals, wood, plastic, paper and card, and clean +100m heavy fraction (inert) materials. Robert Collard, Managing Director, Collard Group said, “We at the Collard Group are driven by a zero waste to landfill commitment, we take waste from site, and process it to make it useful again. We call this recycling the past for the future. To achieve this goal, it is important that we have the latest equipment that is optimised to meet our specifications. “Terex Recycling Systems and Molson Green worked with us to ensure the design, delivery and installation of our new plant worked around our site operations, also taking into consideration our site preparation works to include foundations, building modifications and power supply,” Robert continued. “Close collaboration between all parties ensured our requirements in terms of output were met, whilst also keeping the plant footprint to a minimum to aid their site operations.” "

With waste treatment and recycling facilities in Portsmouth, Fareham and Southampton, the company processes 275,000 tonnes of construction and industrial waste each year together with supplying ready mixed concrete and aggregates from its facilities and has grown from 20 staff to 150 within the last 15 years. Having bought their first Cat machine 14 years ago, the relationship with Finning has gone from strength to strength as support from Finning’s expert team has minimised unplanned downtime.  The latest machines to join their fleet includes five excavators and two-wheel loaders comprising two Cat 313s, two Cat 320s, a 325, and 962M and 938M wheel loaders with additional fire suppression, guards, and belly plates due to the harsh environment they operate in. As all the machines come with a Finning premier warranty, each one is covered for all repairs for up to five years or 8,000 hours. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""472"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/catls_1.jpg"" width=""800""/> Steve Harman, Operations Director at L&S Waste Management said, “We’ve been working alongside Finning for many years as we get great service back up from their team and the Cat product is high quality and reliable, which is key for us, as we have such high volumes of material going through our sites. They stand the test of time, and they hold a good residual value, and with the warranty package and guaranteed buy back from Finning you know what your costs are going to be and there are no hidden extras.” Jack Pilgrim, Territory Account Manager for Finning UK & Ireland, said the team were also supporting L&S with asset management as their fleet is connected with Cat VisionLink which provides data on fuel burn, machine health and idle times. Finning is also proactively providing a monthly fleet benchmarking report which is sent to each site manager and senior staff. He said, “Keeping their machines running is top priority for L&S together with running their fleet efficiently, especially since the switch from red diesel last year, so our report for L&S breaks down their data to cover average run time (hrs) and idle time (%), the average fuel burn for their fleet, and the amount of operator-induced fault codes. “We’re proud to support L&S as they continue to grow and expand their fleet and our extended warranty package gives them complete peace of mind that if anything goes wrong with their Cat machine and it needs to come back into the workshop there are no hidden fees, while our UK coverage means we can get an engineer on site fast,” Jack added.

27 March 2023,Ceulemans’ large Hitachi excavators aid flood prot...,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,ceulemans-large-hitachi-excavators-aid-flood-protection_5889.htm","The Belgian contractor Ceulemans Fr & Co has invested in a pair of Hitachi ZX490LCH-6s that are involved in aiding flood protection in the Netherlands. The Berlaar-based company owns and operates a 30-hectare clay pit at Schelle, from which the large Zaxis excavators dig under licence up to 2,700 tonnes per day to a depth of 15m. “We dig exclusively with Hitachi excavators and our current two ZX490LCH-6s are very productive in the clay pit,” explained Wim Ceulemans, the third generation of the family to run the company. It was founded by his grandfather, Frans Ceulemans, in 1953 and run by his father, Herman, from the early 1970s. The fourth generation, Wim’s son Herman, operates one of the large Zaxis excavators in the pit. “We are satisfied with these machines because of their low fuel consumption, very smooth operation and precise finishing thanks to the hydraulics,” added Wim. “All of our Hitachi machines have proved to be equally reliable and had a strong resale value. My preference is for the ZX490LCH-6 because it has many benefits over the previous generations. It is more modern and sophisticated, as well as being more user-friendly and fuel efficient.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""534"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/Hitachi_Wim Ceulemans_1edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Returning customer Ceulemans Fr & Co has bought over 30 excavators from Luyckx since it ordered the first four UH-series machines from the then newly appointed Belgian Hitachi dealer in 1982. As well as the two ZX490LCH-6s (2018 and 2019), the current fleet includes a ZX300LCH-6 (2017) and a ZX135US-3 (2005). The three larger machines are covered by a five-year, 7,000-hour repair and maintenance contract. “We have been working with Luyckx for over 40 years, because of the good understanding and the friendly business relationship we have built together,” said Wim. “We are convinced of the quality of the products and service we receive, so we hope to continue working with Luyckx and Hitachi for many years to come.” The raw materials excavated by the Zaxis-6 machines are ‘erosion class 1’ and therefore among the best quality clay products available in the region. Ceulemans sells the product to the contractors who are reinforcing the dikes as part of the Dutch Flood Protection Programme. As a low-lying country, the Netherlands is prone to flooding from its many lakes, rivers and canals. Legal safety standards reduce the risk by more than a factor of ten and these are satisfied by the implementation of the programme’s flood protection measures. These cover two-thirds of all primary flood defences that have to be reinforced at an increased pace and decreased cost, compared to previous projects. "
24 March 2023,First Develon-branded ADT,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,first-develonbranded-adt_5883.htm","In February 2023, Doosan celebrated production of the 10,000th articulated dump truck (ADT) from the company’s plant at Elnesvågen outside Molde in Norway. In fact, there was even more to acknowledge with the 10,000th unit as it is the first machine in Europe to officially carry the colours of the company’s new Develon brand.  As well as the Develon branding, the 10,000th ADT also carries an extra special design, which harks back to the origins of the ADT range. A time well before Doosan and even the Moxy era, back to the Viking ADT model, 12 of which were produced by the company, Øveraasen, in the time before Moxy took over production. This is recognised by a Viking ship motif on the tailgate of the 10,000th unit, a Develon DA45-7 model.  Over the years, a number of different ADT models have been produced at Molde, including the D15, 5222B, 6225B, 7235, MT40, MT41, DA40 and now, today's models, the DA30-7 and the DA45-7. Rosendal Maskin AS, the Authorised Dealer for Norway, has supplied ADTs since 1987, and has delivered a total of almost 500 of the 10,000 so far produced! According to the Molde Plant Manager, Jan Roger Lindset, the 10,000th ADT with production number 851951 has been purchased from Rosendal Maskin AS by the Rental Group in Norway. Production began at the Molde plant in 1972 when the business was called Glamox. Since then, the brand has had a number of names such as Moxy, Moxy Industrial, Brown Engineering, Moxy Trucks, Moxy Engineering and in 2008, the name changed to Doosan when the South Korean manufacturer bought the factory and the product. In 2021, Hyundai Heavy Industries bought the Doosan construction equipment range including the ADT line, and the name of the business was changed to Hyundai Doosan Infracore (HDI). There are currently 150 employees at the Elnesvågen plant, but with both Develon and Hyundai ADTs now being produced at the factory, the workforce is expected to expand to meet an expected 40% growth in production.   <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""600"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/Develon DA45-7 6_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Develon ADT range  The Develon ADT range comprises two 6x6 models – the DA30-7 and DA45-7 Stage 5 compliant machines – the DA30-7 has a payload of 28 tonnes, while that of the DA45-7 is 41 tonnes. The range was extended at Bauma 2022 with the launch of a new 4x4 version of the DA45-7 ADT, intended to compete with rigid dump trucks (RDTs) in the 40-tonne class. Like all Develon ADTs, the DA30-7 and DA45-7 models feature an articulation hinge positioned behind the turning ring to provide equal weight distribution to the front axle even during maximum steer articulation. This combined with a free-swinging rear tandem bogie ensures equal distribution of weight to each wheel and guarantees permanent 6-wheel contact and drive for equal power distribution and excellent performance particularly on difficult terrains such as soft ground, uneven surfaces, very steep slopes, tight turns or a combination of all of these difficult conditions. Collectively, the forward turning point, the unique tandem bogie and the sloping rear frame results in what Develon calls ‘best in class’ rough and soft terrain capabilities. The unique body shape and sloping frame ensure equal load distribution on all the wheels making these machines the best haulers for soft terrain work. The design of the articulation also provides equal load distribution on the wheels on both the left- and right-hand side when turning, which is very important for the traction and stability of the machines. All of these outstanding features are available on the Develon Stage 5 DA30-7 and DA45-7 ADT models. In the new 4x4 ADT, the front truck and cab unit is the same as in the original 6x6 model, with modifications being made on the rear dumper unit only. Featuring a ZF EP8-420 transmission, the 4x4 DA45-7 is a two-axle ADT with twin wheels at the rear, and with a dumper section similar to that on RDTs in the 40-tonne class. Short turning radius As well as performing better in conditions that are tough for RDTs, the new 4x4 DA45-7 ADT has a width of less than 4m to avoid the need for special transportation and offers a better turning radius than a comparable RDT. The shorter turning radius and the design of the rear dumper unit, which is more suited to carrying flat and heavy rocks, provide particular advantages in the mining and tunnelling industries.   The latter are growing markets for ADTs, and include pioneering, short-term mining projects, quarrying and contract mining industries, especially those in southern Africa, the UK and Australia. Construction and bulk earthmoving contractors involved in roads, dams, airports, landfills and development projects are also large users of ADTs. Together these areas make the ADT market a wide and varied one, thereby ensuring a large customer base. "
23 March 2023,Tree surgery firm acquires latest Bobcat machines,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,tree-surgery-firm-acquires-latest-bobcat-machines_5882.htm","Over the last six to seven years, HTC Arbor Services Ltd, a tree surgery company based in Northamptonshire, UK, has continued to expand with the purchase of new Bobcat mini-excavators, loaders and attachments. The Bobcat equipment has been supplied and is supported by Peterborough-based RTC Plant Services Ltd (www.rtcplant.com), the Authorised Bobcat dealer for Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire. Andy Hollingsworth, company owner and founder of HTC, who has many years of tree surgery experience said, “At HTC, we have operated in virtually every scenario including residential, local council, new build developers and in the rail and power industries. I must pay thanks to the excellent service and advice provided by Dave Ellis and the team at RTC. Our preference for the high performance of the Bobcat brand mirrors our commitment to providing a friendly and professional service, whilst delivering the highest standard of tree surgery and felling.” Andy started the business 16 years ago, becoming a limited company halfway through that time. The Bobcat story at HTC began shortly after with the purchase of a 2.6-tone E26 mini-excavator which often works together with a tracked woodchipper. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""536"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/T76_HTC_pic1_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Higher productivity  Andy Hollingsworth added, “We prefer compact plant like Bobcat mini-excavators and compact track loaders because of the access they provide to the restricted and tight areas we are almost always required to work in. There is also a massive productivity advantage from the use of Bobcat machines and attachments. Work that would take a gang of five workers a week, we can complete in just two days with three staff.” After the E26, the next purchase was a second-hand Bobcat T190 compact track loader, which had a similar positive impact to that of the E26. Demonstrating the value these machines can offer to an expanding business like HTC, Andy was able to sell on the T190 for more money than he paid for it.           As HTC has continued to win more business, the company has powered its expansion with the acquisition of the latest generation, 5.3-tonne Bobcat E55z mini-excavator and T76 compact track loader products, whilst still utilising the existing E26. The company also has a 1-tonne Bobcat E10z mini-excavator which is used primarily for local council work. Andy Hollingsworth continued, “With the addition of the E55z and T76, we have been able to take our output to the next level. The E55z is often equipped with a tree shearer, allowing us to take on bigger clearance jobs and when working alongside the T76 fitted with forestry mulcher or stone crusher attachments, we have an unrivalled selection of equipment to choose from for the projects we undertake.” "

Rounding out the company’s compact solutions portfolio, this GNSS option allows contractors to integrate their compact machines into fleets already powered by GNSS technology. This expansion gives owners of skid-steers, compact track loaders (CTL) and mini-excavators the broadest offering of machine control options to date. “We initially built MC-Mobile with the smaller or mid-size contractor in mind,” said Murray Lodge, executive vice president and general manager, Topcon. “Working with a prism pole and our 3D robotic instrument, the LN-150, users easily measure, design and build right on-site, all with one 3-in-1 solution – expanding their capabilities and growing their business. This new GNSS option allows fleet managers to easily integrate compact machines into much larger, more complex workflows, with the same machine-to-machine modularity and ease-of-use that has made MC-Mobile one of our most talked-about products of the last year. Both the local positioning system (LPS) and GNSS versions are made possible thanks to the MC-X platform.” The MC-X architecture combines multiple communication technologies, such as the Sitelink3D connectivity platform, support for numerous elevation sensors, IMUs and GNSS receivers, to tailor solutions directly to a contractor’s workflow. The entire MC-X powered portfolio is designed to make machine control easy to use and affordable for a variety of contractors. It ties together mixed fleets of earthmoving (both full-size and compact), asphalt and concrete paving equipment, and is designed to be as flexible as it is powerful, adapting across applications and machine types, improving performance and speed for operators of all skill levels.

Headquartered in Duxford, Cambridgeshire, and with offices spread throughout England, Scotland and Wales, the twelve staff are currently training for ABF The Soldiers' Charity's Cateran Yomp, which challenges teams of soldiers, veterans and civilians to walk 22, 36 or 54 miles across the rugged terrain of the Perthshire countryside in less than 24 hours. Participants will head off on the Cateran Trail in the foothills of the Cairngorm Mountains at 6am on Saturday 3rd June 2023, returning to Blairgowrie in the early hours of Sunday 4th June. Last year's event raised just over £500,000 for soldiers, veterans and their families, with 630 participants travelling as far as the U.S, Canada, Australia, Cyprus, Poland and the Netherlands. The team represents a cross-section of the company's diverse community, ranging in age from late 20s to early 60s, with job roles consisting of engineering, marketing, sales and support office staff. They are spread across almost all of SMT GB's nine Customer Support Centres and, despite training in their own areas, routinely get together online to discuss progress and targets. Leading the team is Duxford-based Health and Safety Manager Anthony McCann (55), who served with the Royal Artillery for almost 30 years, and whose three sons are still currently serving. Anthony joined the army as a soldier at the age of 16. Over the course of his 28-year career, Anthony served in Northern Ireland, The Falklands, Cyprus, Iraq and Afghanistan and rose to the rank of Captain. Commenting on the challenge, Anthony said, ""I have been eager to take part in The Cateran Yomp for some time, really just to challenge myself while raising money for ABF The Soldiers' Charity. When I was serving, we held many fundraising events for the charity. As well as my own sons, a few of the team members also have military backgrounds so, knowing the valuable work ABF do, we are all determined to do our bit to support them. The Yomp will also be a fantastic networking opportunity and away-day, as some of us have yet to meet face-to-face. For me, at the age of 55, it's not going to be easy, but it wouldn't be a challenge if it were!"" When asked what the team's participation in the Cateran Yomp means for the company, SMT GB CEO Nick Allen added, ""We are thrilled to have such a large team supporting ABF The Soldiers' Charity. At SMT GB, a sizable number of our staff members are former service personnel, and we feel that it is important for us to do our part and give something back. By taking part in the Cateran Yomp, the team is embodying SMT GB's company values of caring, daring and sharing, while also working to support an incredibly worthy charity."" Since 1944, ABF The Soldiers' Charity has provided a lifetime of practical and financial assistance to soldiers, veterans and their families across the UK. During the financial year 21/22, the charity supported 65,000 people in 48 countries worldwide. Since its launch, the Cateran Yomp has raised over £4M for the charity, with donations funding everything from wheelchair ramps for the homes of soldiers, veterans and their families, to respite care and personal recovery plans for injured soldiers returning from the front line.

20 March 2023,High demand for engine rebuilds,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,high-demand-for-engine-rebuilds_5873.htm","Power generation experts at Finning, the world’s largest dealer of Cat power solutions, have seen a 176% rise in demand for engine overhauls between 2019 and 2022, as customers push to reach net zero targets whilst looking to minimise capital expenditure. Peter Hutyan, Product Manager for Energy & Transportation at Finning said overhauls were increasingly attractive to customers across all sectors from marine, electric power and industrial as overhauling an engine can offer a faster turnaround, while also allowing customers to hold on to an asset they trust. Another key driver is that the cost for an overhaul is typically 60 to 70% lower compared with a new replacement engine. Peter said, “All of this resonates well with our customers which is why we’re seeing such growth in this area. By overhauling their existing engine, it can serve them for several engine lifetimes, the process can be complete within a few days to a few months, and it can go another 20,000 hours before the next major intervention, depending on the engine model – so there’s nothing not to like. “Finning is in its 90th year of selling and servicing Cat equipment and engines and can offer customers access to expertly trained technicians and Cat certified components,” Peter continued. “And because Cat is remanufacturing at scale the greenhouse gas (GHG) savings are high. We also have the capability to dyno test most engines, which is not the case for all service providers, which is why we can stand by the quality of our overhauls. “Our overhaul warranties go further offering customers up to three years/ 6,000 hours on selected models, whichever occurs first, giving them complete reassurance and peace of mind,” Peter confirmed. “We can even help customers manage the cost of their overhaul with a tailormade low-rate finance offer from Cat Financial.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""600"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/Catenginerebuild2_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Engine overhaul options As engines come in all sizes depending on the sector and application they serve, Finning has created a programme of overhaul options based on maintenance intervals that includes a complete Cat Certified engine rebuild to a top end overhaul. Lower cost options are also available and cover the reconditioning of parts that experience high levels of wear.  Engine overhaul options currently include (available on selected models. Exclusions and terms and conditions apply): Electric Power – Major Overhaul/Service Exchange, In-Frame Overhaul and Top End; Industrial – Major Overhaul/Service Exchange, Top and Tail, and Value; Marine – Major Overhaul, Top End and Turbocharger bearing housing re-bearing/re-seal; and Oil and Gas – Major Overhaul and Top End. A large proportion of the parts removed from the original engine during the overhaul are also recovered, restored, and reused as a standard part of the overhaul process creating a circular economy of sorts, while achieving a like-new asset at the fraction of the cost of a brand-new product.

A team of 150 engineers is working on the pioneering initiative to develop hydrogen combustion engines – and more than 50 prototypes have already been manufactured at JCB’s UK engine plant. The wraps came off the brand new JCB hydrogen combustion engine – the company’s zero-carbon emissions solution for construction and agricultural equipment – at the Conexpo 2023 show yesterday in Las Vegas as part of the International Fluid Power Exposition (IFPE). JCB Chairman Anthony Bamford is leading the project to develop JCB’s hydrogen technology. Lord Bamford said, “The JCB engineering team has made enormous strides in a short space of time to develop a hydrogen internal combustion engine. As the first construction equipment company to develop a fully working combustion engine fuelled by hydrogen, I’m delighted we are now able to present this technology on the international stage.” Prototype JCB hydrogen engines are already powering backhoe loader and Loadall telescopic handler machines. JCB has also made a major breakthrough in proving the wider appeal of hydrogen combustion technology by installing one of the super-efficient hydrogen engines into a 7.5 Mercedes tonne truck – a retrofit which was completed in just days. JCB has also unveiled its very own designed and built mobile refuelling bowser to take the fuel to the machines. The bowser has enough hydrogen gas to fill 16 hydrogen backhoe loaders and can be transported either on the back of a modified JCB Fastrac tractor or on a trailer. Lord Bamford said, “The JCB engineering team has gone back to first principles to completely re-design the combustion process to work for hydrogen. In doing so they have achieved two major things: secured JCB’s place in history as the first construction equipment company to develop a fully working combustion engine fuelled by hydrogen and steered us towards the production of a landmark 50 hydrogen combustion engines.” JCB’s commitment to reducing emissions goes back almost 25 years and the latest diesel engines designed to comply with European Stage 5 regulations have already delivered a 97% reduction in NOx emissions since 1999 and a 98% reduction in particulates. In addition, JCB’s drive to reduce fuel consumption means today’s JCB machines use 50% less fuel on average than those manufactured more than a decade ago. This has saved 16 billion litres of fuel – equivalent to 53 million tonnes of CO2. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""520"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/MS2_4314_edit2.jpeg"" width=""800""/> Leading the way JCB has also been at the forefront of electric technology development to meet customers’ demands for zero-carbon products. While battery electric is suitable for smaller machines which do less hours and typically use less fuel, larger machines have a higher energy requirement. This would result in larger batteries, which would take longer to charge, making them less suitable for machines which work multiple daily shifts and do not have the available downtime to recharge. As a result, JCB has concentrated its development of electric machines on its compact range, including the 525-60E Loadall telehandler and the <a href=""https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,digger-goes-jcb-electric_2251.htm"" target=""_blank"">19C-1E mini-excavator</a> – the world’s first electric mini-excavator. As the company examines future fuels which deliver zero emissions, it has left no stone unturned. In its search for a mobile fuel which can be taken to the machine, ensuring maximum uptime and fast refuelling, HVO, biogas, E-fuels, ammonia, and hydrogen have all come under the microscope. Interestingly, JCB engines have been approved for use with HVO since Stage IIIB / Tier 4i engine legislation came into force. Lord Bamford said, “The majority of these alternative fuels require the production of hydrogen to make, so it makes perfect sense to use hydrogen in the first place because it is a clean zero carbon fuel which can be produced from renewable energy. Hydrogen also offers a potential solution to the challenge of batteries on larger machines; it allows for <a href=""https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,jcb-unveils-first-mobile-hydrogen-refueller_5579.htm"" target=""_blank"">fast refuelling</a> and is a mobile fuel solution, allowing fuel to be taken to the machine.” As part of its hydrogen development, JCB also investigated its use in fuel cells and in July 2020 unveiled the construction industry’s first ever hydrogen powered excavator – a 20-tonne 220X. For the time being, JCB has come to the conclusion that fuel cells are too expensive, too complicated and not robust enough for construction and agricultural equipment.  In challenging the JCB engineering team to think differently using technology that is around us in a zero-carbon way, the JCB hydrogen engine was born. Lord Bamford said, “The unique combustion properties of hydrogen enable the hydrogen engine to deliver the same power, the same torque, and the same efficiency that powers JCB machines today, but in a zero-carbon way. Hydrogen combustion engines also offer other significant benefits. By leveraging diesel engine technology and components, they do not require rare earth elements and critically, combustion technology is already well proven on construction and agricultural equipment. It is a technology which is cost effective, robust, reliable and well known throughout not just the construction and agricultural industry, but the whole world.” "
17 March 2023,Caterpillar crowns winner of 2022/2023 Global Oper...,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,caterpillar-crowns-winner-of-20222023-global-operator-challenge_5872.htm","More than 5,500 machine operators worldwide have been competing in the Caterpillar Global Operator Challenge since the spring of 2022, and one of them has finally been crowned 'World Champion' – the best Cat construction machine operator on the planet. This week, Patrick Doheny of Australia (pictured above) took the crown out of nine finalists from around the world who competed in the final round of the Global Operator Challenge in the Cat Operator Stadium in Las Vegas. Caterpillar’s year-long Global Operator Challenge is one of the largest construction industry events, with operators from nearly three dozen countries participating. The Challenge highlights the amazing ways construction machine operators masterfully guide Cat machines and use the latest technologies to get the job done. The Challenge kicked off in the spring of 2022 with more than 10,000 operators worldwide signing up to compete. After a pre-qualification phase, the first round featured 5,500 contestants competing in local events organized by 77 Cat dealers in 32 countries. The second round in the fall of 2022 consisted of four regional events held in the United States, Brazil, Spain, and Japan. These competitions included digging a trench, loading a precise amount of dirt, and hauling or maneuvering the machines through obstacles. The third and final round this week in Las Vegas was the ultimate test of precision. Grouped into teams of three – Team Americas, Team Europe, and Team Asia – the nine finalists competed individually and as teams, as they faced three challenges in a specially constructed stadium featuring stands, fans, big-screen TVs, and play-by-play announcers. The finals kicked off with the ‘Fork ‘n Loader’ challenge, where each operator used the Cat 950 wheel loader with Payload technology to load and move material through specified locations on the course. The ‘Backhoe Services’ challenge had operators using both ends of the Cat 420 XE backhoe to open a small box and precisely place small objects inside. This challenge was designed by Jaus Neigum, the 2020 Caterpillar Global Operator Challenge World Champion, and highlighted Caterpillar’s Customer Value Agreements and services offerings. During the final ‘Trench Run’ challenge, operators showed off their trenching skills using a Cat 315 excavator equipped with Grade technology. Final scores were based on the operator’s skills, efficiency, and competence in executing a variety of tasks, with penalties imposed for errors. Awards were given to the overall event champion, the individual with the lowest time in each skills challenge, and the team with the lowest combined score. The operators completed the challenges using Cat construction machines integrated with the latest machine-control and payload technologies, including Cat Payload, Grade and Command, Cat Grade Assist, rearview cameras, return to dig and return to carry. Final Awards Patrick Doheny from Australia was crowned the champion. Caterpillar awarded him with a trip for two to a location where Caterpillar has one of its worldwide production facilities. “I am beyond thrilled to have earned the title of the best Caterpillar machine operator on the planet,” Doheny said. “Kudos to Caterpillar for hosting such an incredible event to highlight the importance of our profession. It is truly a dream come true to see your life’s passion be rewarded in such an amazing way.” In second place was Matt Ferris from the United States, and third place was awarded to Łukasz Mokrzyński from Poland.

16 March 2023,Response to Chancellor’s Spring Budget,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,response-to-chancellors-spring-budget_5868.htm","The UK construction industry has responded to the Chancellor’s Spring Budget, which was revealed yesterday. Suneeta Johal, Chief Executive at the Construction Equipment Association said, “Although there were no great surprises from Jeremy Hunt’s Spring Statement today – as many of the announcements were ‘leaked’ earlier this week, there were some positive announcements that will boost productivity within the construction sector. Hunt claimed that this budget was for ‘long-term, sustainable, healthy growth’ and said the Government would deliver 12 new investment zones, which he labelled ‘12 potential Canary Wharfs’. “The CEA welcomes this announcement and the £80 billion funding to support a range of interventions including skills, infrastructure, tax relief, and business rates retention, particularly after the delays to HS2 announced last week,” Johal continued. “Although investment funding is subject to application, where ‘an area must identify a location where it can offer a bold and imaginative partnership between local government and university or research institutes in a way that catalyses new innovation clusters’, it does offer an excellent opportunity for collaboration and innovation.  “Another positive announcement was the new £9 billion policy of ‘full capital expensing’ for the next three years, which is to be saluted. Although currently a welcome short-term boost for business investment as we see the end of the super deduction this month, we hope to see Hunt follow through on his aim to make it permanent to encourage investment and provide stability in the long term. Hunt says the OBR believes this will boost business tax by 3% a year. “A new ‘enhanced credit’ for research-intensive businesses, worth £27 for every £100 it invests is a great incentive for start-up companies investing in R&D,” Johal added. “A qualifying small or medium-sized business must spend 40% or more of their total expenditure on R&D. The extension of the climate change agreement scheme for two years was another welcome move to allow eligible businesses £600 million of tax relief for energy efficiency measures, particularly important as we head down the road to net zero. “The fuel duty freeze is also well received and will be of great benefit to the construction and infrastructure sectors. Hunt said, ‘For a further 12 months I’m going to maintain the 5p cut and I’m going to freeze fuel duty too.’ The business tax hike was confirmed, with Hunt keeping the planned increase in corporation tax from 19% to 25% in April – despite opposition from some Tory MPs. The Chancellor’s predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng had attempted to scrap the hike at the disastrous mini-Budget in 2022 – but there was a U-turn after financial turmoil. “The Chancellor set out the four pillars of our industrial strategy – Enterprise, Employment, Education and Everywhere – Hunt said that he had already allocated nearly £4 billion in over 200 projects across the country through the first two rounds of the Levelling Up Fund and a third round will follow, another welcome announcement,” Johal continued. “Whilst the CEA welcomes the announcement of more places on ‘skills boot camps’ to encourage over-50s who have left their jobs to return to the workplace – it is not the silver bullet we were hoping to fill the chronic skills gap in our sector – we need more tangible solutions and partnerships to tackle the shortfall.” CPA's response Following Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s Spring Budget, Kevin Minton, Chief Executive of the Construction Plant-hire Association (CPA) said, “Steps to boost business investment and maintain the freeze on fuel duty are welcome. However, we are seeking clarification from the Treasury on the details around the successor to the super-deduction allowance (SDA), and whether the plant-hire sector can qualify for this new scheme. “Following the announcements on the delay to HS2 last week, a Budget for growth needs firm commitments from government on future infrastructure spending and projects,” Minton added. “Proposals in the Budget to create Great British Nuclear, while welcome, do not provide immediate comfort to the construction sector, given these plans are medium to long-term goals. However, we hope plans to provide the Carbon Capture Usage and Storage scheme with its £20bn fund, could provide some level of confidence for infrastructure planning. “The construction sector may welcome the Chancellor’s plans to attract over 50s to the workplace to help address the skills shortfall the industry is facing. However, this new scheme must complement existing initiatives already in place.” "
15 March 2023,Electric Bobcat skid-steer loader & RogueX concept,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,electric-bobcat-skidsteer-loader-roguex-concept_5865.htm","Bobcat has taken innovation to the next level with the introduction of two new concept machines unveiled during the first day of Conexpo 2023. Following the 2022 release of the Bobcat T7X, the world’s first all-electric compact track loader, Bobcat has now unveiled the world’s first all-electric skid-steer loader, the Bobcat S7X. Bobcat has also stepped beyond industry expectations with the unveiling of its new concept track loader, the Bobcat RogueX. This next-generation concept machine explores the capabilities of electric power, autonomous operation and dual lift-arm geometry. Electric S7X skid-steer loader Like the T7X, the S7X is all electric, as it is powered by a 60.5-kWh, lithium-ion battery, features electric drive motors and utilizes ball screw actuators for lift and tilt functions. Together, the battery and electrical powertrain generate incredible performance characteristics, with instantaneous torque that is as much as three times greater than traditional loaders. The powerful loader balances sustainability and performance with zero emissions and is equipped to outperform its diesel-powered equivalent. This skid-steer loader offers operators a smooth and comfortable experience with minimal vibration and nearly silent operation. The S7X can operate for up to 8 hours on a single charge depending on the application, giving most operators more than a full day’s work when breaks and downtime are considered. A full charge takes approximately 10 hours. “As the inventor of the original skid-steer loader, we are excited to take the machine that created the industry and reinvent it all over again,” said Joel Honeyman, Doosan Bobcat Vice President of Global Innovation. “The S7X is an incredible product with real-world application that can support operators on environmentally sensitive sites, in noise-restricted areas and for indoor operation.” At this time, the S7X skid-steer loader is being debuted as a prototype machine. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""534"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/bobcat-roguex (2)_red.jpg"" width=""800""/> RogueX The Bobcat RogueX combines technologically advanced features to make it a one-of-a-kind conceptual machine. While most closely resembling a track loader, the machine is in a league of its own. As a research and development project, the machine was built as a proving ground to advance the Bobcat innovation roadmap, evaluate customer perceptions and test the limits of machine functionality. “RogueX was concepted with consideration for the worksite of the future and how a customer’s needs may evolve—with a focus on ease of use, remote operations, autonomous functionality, sustainable operations and features that allow operators to accomplish more with one machine,” said Honeyman. As jobsites change and operators turn to remote operation, Bobcat took its concept further by fully eliminating an operator station. The machine explores the idea of operating where humans cannot go to tackle more work in more places than ever from a remote position. By building the loader without a cab and using advanced kinematics, RogueX features next-generation unique functionality including both vertical-path and radial-path lift capabilities in one machine. The all-electric and autonomous concept machine produces zero emissions as it features a lithium-ion battery, electric drive system and no hydraulics. “After our successful development of building an all-electric loader the Bobcat T7X, we wanted to think bigger, broader and take a leap far into the future,” said Matt Sagaser, Director of Innovation Accelerated at Bobcat. “Our dedicated innovation team took a bold approach and designed a machine that breaks all of the rules. RogueX sets a framework for what is possible, and our team is just getting started on what is next.” RogueX is in the early research and development stage at Bobcat. "

The new models span the range of demolition and sorting grapples, multipurpose grapples for Cat Tilt-rotators, vibratory compactor plates and cold planers.   Expanded demolition and sorting grapples Expanding the Cat Demolition and Sorting Grapple line, the new G306 and G308 models are specifically designed for 5- to 6-ton and 7- to 10-ton mini hydraulic excavators respectively. These new models are said to excel in waste, recycling and heavy-duty material handling applications where precise material placement is required. With open and close functions controlled by the machine’s first auxiliary function and rotation head handled by the second, these grapples deliver fast and productive material handling with 360-degrees of bidirectional rotation. A slim design makes it easier to get into tight spaces, and material capacities range from 160L with the G306 to 240L for the G308. Vertical perforated shelves offer high wear resistance, positive penetration, good load visibility and easy positioning, while the oversized heavy-duty cylinder with load holding valve delivers constant clamping force, even when manoeuvring the grapple or machine. Providing reliable operation with low maintenance intervals, the swing bearing features a single-ball heavy-duty, internally driven design. For longer life, the weld-on base edge design is made of HB500 Brinell equivalent material and bolt-on cutting edge (BOCE) from high-strength, abrasion-resistant steel.   <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""534"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/CM20230313-00dc0-09eea_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> A first for Cat tilt-rotators The first hydraulic attachment expansion for the Cat tilt-rotator (TRS) product family, the new Cat G206 and G208 Multi-Purpose Grapples expands the grapple technology in combination with the TRS6 and TRS8 models for 5- to 10-ton mini hydraulic excavators. These models allow maximum manoeuvrability with TRS attachments, and an integrated bracket provides minimal offset to optimise performance of grapple functionality. With the G206 sized for 5- to 6-ton excavators and the G208 for 7- to 10-ton models, these multi-purpose grapples deliver 14.5kN and 18.4kN maximum closing force respectively. An integrated cylinder load holding valve maintains grapple closing pressure with no leakage, while the hard-mounted piston accumulator maintains grapple arm closing forces with shifting loads. Careful routing of the integrated jumper lines and hoses safeguards against damage and dirt infiltration for long-term reliability. The grapple design is matched to the tilt-rotate system, and the rotation of the TRS allows for quick and easy material engagement. To avoid any bending torques in radial direction, these grapples feature a welded box structure. With grapple arms and arm edges built with AR450 steel, the arm offers high abrasion resistance for longer wear in extreme conditions. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/catvib1_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Vibratory compactor plates Caterpillar expands its Cat Vibratory Plate Compactor line with the new CVP28 and CVP55 models and relaunches its CVP16 and CVP40 compactors with new design enhancements. Well suited for the compaction of soil, sand, gravel and asphalt, the compactors’ flexibility delivers lower investment and maintenance costs for contractors engaging in residential, commercial and industrial work. The Cat CVP range is performance-matched to Cat machines, covering all backhoe loaders and excavators ranging from the Cat 302.7 to the 313. They offer compaction widths from 304.8mm to 660.4mm and compact areas ranging from 0.19m<sup>2 </sup>to 0.53m<sup>2</sup> at vibration frequencies from 33.3 to 40Hz (2,000 to 2,400vpm). Their heavy-duty steel frame promises to deliver maximum power to the ground. Rubber mounts isolate vibrations from the compactor attachment, minimising vibration feedback to the rest of the machine. The gear-type hydro motor is vibration driven for consistent, reliable power. The design’s access cut-outs are laser cut for easy access to hardware when mounting the top bracket. The compactor is simplified with standard auxiliary hydraulics. Expanding the flexibility of the CVP range, post and plate driver attachments bolt to the bottom of the CVP28 for specialized applications. All models can be equipped with a backfill blade to help spread out material in the ditch prior to compaction, and a swivel mount rotates 90 degrees in each direction to reduce machine movements. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/CM20230313-76b0b-3717b_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Milling precision Designed for small paving jobs in residential and commercial applications, new Cat Cold Planers deliver economical restoration of asphalt and concrete surfaces. They efficiently mill imperfections prior to resurfacing and remove deteriorated pavement and traffic lane stripes. Offering a working width of 350mm and 120mm maximum milling depth, the new PC35 is designed for operation with side-shift backhoe loaders and 5- to 6-ton mini hydraulic excavators. The new Cat PC45 replaces the PC404 with its 450mmcutting width and 150-mm cutting depth and is ideal for use with backhoe loaders and extends the planer’s compatibility to 7- to 10-ton mini hydraulic excavators. The cold planers come standard with a cut depth indicator, giving the operator a quick view of set depth. Delivering consistent depth control, milling depth is manually adjusted and locked in. Their heavy-duty gear motor provides high torque and efficiency across the speed range, while a hydraulic relief valve limits pressure to the motor for increased longevity. Helping to maximise productivity, a standard pressure gauge provides feedback to the operator to allow for ground speed adjustments. Simplifying operation, the PC35 and PC45 reuse existing hammer lines and are equipped with drum centre and width indicators. "

14 March 2023,"New Cat 926, 930 and 938 wheel loaders","https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,new-cat-926-930-and-938-wheel-loaders_5858.htm","['The Next Generation of Cat 926, 930 and 938 Wheel Loaders offer a range of new technologies and features designed to boost productivity by simplifying machine operation. Adding flexibility by design, the versatile Cat small wheel loaders offer industry-specific configurations to efficiently handle agriculture, waste, forestry, aggregate and snow removal applications. Customised models can be equipped direct from the factory or through aftermarket upgrade kits installed by a Cat dealer. Delivering efficient power, the Cat exclusive adaptive engine rpm feature automatically adjusts engine speed based on operator input to optimise productivity and minimise fuel burn. Systems are optimised and sized to run at standard lower engine rpm for these next gen small wheel loaders. The productive and efficient 1,200 to 1,500rpm working range makes the loaders more fuel efficient, while larger pumps run at slower speeds for less wear and longer service life, reckons Cat. Drivetrain technology An industry first, these new wheel loaders feature four powertrain operating modes. Utility mode is designed for hydromechanical tool use or pick-and-place work with implement power and quick speed, utility vehicle mode delivers fine ground speed control with engine rpm throttle lock. Torque mode saves up to 5% on fuel by ‘freewheeling’ around corners and on downhills. Hystat mode provides engine braking with aggressive deceleration, acceleration and no travel until the throttle is applied. And finally Ice mode is for snow-clearing applications, ice mode offers soft directional shifts and extended coast-out for improved control. New auto wheel torque control lets the machine do the work by automatically controlling torque to the wheel and adjusting rimpull control to reduce tire spin. Improving traction on difficult terrain, the new loaders feature standard front axle differential lock with optional limited rear slip differential. On the 926 and 930 loaders, the differential lock is simply controlled on-the-go by the operator with the joystick.

Simple in-cab pushbutton kickout settings for upper, lower and tilt allow operators to match bucket position to the task, helping to maximise bucket cutting edge life. Controlled by a joystick button, a new bucket shake feature provides precise metering of materials in batching or spreading applications and cleans the bucket. Incorporating automotive style and amenities, the new cab elevates operator comfort and improves visibility to increase safety. Smaller cab pillars, increased window area, heated and electric rear-view mirrors with lower parabolic, and standard rear-view camera combine to improve operator visibility around the machine. New options include a multi-view camera delivering a bird’s-eye view around the loader, and rear object detection with visual and audible alarms provides additional alerts to the rear of the machine. New auto temperature control with defrost button provides consistent operating comfort in a range of ambient temperatures. Auto lighting with daytime running lights conveniently illuminates the machine’s lights when the sun goes down. An optional beacon mounted atop the cab gives a visual alert when the operator isn’t inside the cab or wearing the seatbelt to improve safety. The next gen small wheel loaders expand Cat Command for Loading to the global market. Advancing safety and productivity, Command for Loading offers remote control of the loader to remove the operator from hazardous conditions. New for this model series, the command console offers efficient line-of-sight machine operation through the console’s ergonomic control layout of loader functions. The command station positions the operator in a virtual cab with familiar controls and machine displays for remote, non-line-of-sight loader control. Elevating efficiency and productivity, one operator can control multiple machines, one at a time, at different sites from a single command station. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""534"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/CM20230313-97e0c-b5743_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Efficient operation The customisable in-cab display delivers an easy view of operating parameters. Using Operator Profiles, up to 50 different operating profiles can be set through the display, which the loader can recall when an operator starts the machine. The next-gen loaders now come with two steering option – new force feedback joystick steer control and a low-effort steering wheel – to further customise machine configuration. New joystick steering allows the loaders to travel at speeds reaching 25mph (40kph) as a result of the force feedback feature that stiffens at higher speeds and softens as speed decreases. Additionally, the new loaders offer the option of joystick or single axis levers, and both come with a range of programmable options to meet operator preference. Included with joystick controls, the versatile jog dial offers quick, on-the-go speed, throttle lock, auxiliary hydraulic flow, and wheel torque adjustments as well as screen navigation and creep speed control. With standard parallelism, the optimised Z-bar linkage digs like a Z-bar but acts like a tool carrier, increasing versatility and visibility. The design provides coupler and high lift options for all new models. The patented positive pressure fusion coupler interface eliminates wear and maximises performance with reduced work tool offset. A full range of work tools for the new loaders includes optimised forks with mechanical parallel lift and performance series buckets featuring an aggressive rack angle for load retention and a 10% boost in fill factors. The new machine design improves visibility to the implements. An aggressive rack angle affords full cutting-edge and outstanding bucket corner visibility. Excellent fork tip visibility at ground level and full height allows the operator to confidently load and unload materials, while an optional cranked tine further enhances forward visibility. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""534"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/CM20230313-cfdc0-1bd9b_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Significant service savings Engine oil and filters and fuel filter service intervals increase to 1,000 hours for the next gen small wheel loaders. Over 10,000 operating hours, this saves 45% in engine oil, 67% in fuel filters, and 45% on air filters, substantially lowering service costs and improving loader uptime. Full return filtration on the Hystat, implement and steering systems keeps the hydraulic oil cleaner and improves system reliability. All daily service items are now within easy reach, and the new cabin filter is serviced from ground level, shortening service time and improving safety. Optional integrated autolube with adjustable grease frequency helps to maximise component life and reduce costs through proper greasing of hinge points. Available tyre pressure and temperature monitoring with adjustable safety limits help to extend tire life and minimise costs. Conexpo-Con/Agg 2023 attendees will be the first to preview the Next Generation Cat 930 Wheel Loader from March 14th (that’s today!) to 18th in Caterpillar’s outdoor Festival Lot exhibit F9127. Target production date for these small wheel loaders is Q4 2023.']"
14 March 2023,Solidlink is the new name for Liebherr quick coupl...,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,solidlink-is-the-new-name-for-liebherr-quick-couplers_5856.htm","Liebherr will now market its well-known Likufix quick coupling system globally with the brand name Solidlink. However, the system will retain the Likufix brand name in German and French-speaking countries. The time-tested quick couplers promise to deliver maximum efficiency and safety for customers for changing attachments. Solidlink or Likufix is suitable for use both with Liebherr products and with machines from other manufacturers. The fully automatic Solidlink quick coupling system enables attachments to be changed easily and conveniently from the driver's cab at the touch of a button. It quickly and safely connects the machine to the attachment to form a powerful unit. Solidlink is hydromechanically mounted to deliver balance in all axes and degrees of freedom. As the attachment can be changed from the driver's cab, the possibility of personnel being in the danger zone during the change process can be ruled out fully. The proximity sensor also monitors the correct position of the attachment in the locking position. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/liebherr-solidlink-2-96dpi.jpg"" width=""800""/> If the pins are extended during coupling without the attachment tool being connected to the quick coupler, the machine operator is alerted by a warning sound in the cab and a warning signal on the display. Furthermore, the two-hand control process means that the machine cannot operate out of control during the coupling process and the safety risks this can create can therefore be ruled out. The high strength of the system is due to a solid metal plate and recessed hydraulic couplings that prevent damage during the coupling process. An optional bracket on the coupling block also protects the hydraulic lines. "
14 March 2023,Rhodar delivers regeneration using Hyundai’s next ...,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,rhodar-delivers-regeneration-using-hyundais-next-generation_5855.htm","Construction enabling works contractor Rhodar is growing at pace, having secured a number of significant new contracts across the UK in recent months. These wins, spanning its core demolition, remediation, asbestos removal and passive fire protection services, include a £6 million regeneration project in Leeds. Such a strong and positive growth trajectory meant that the business needed to make a sizeable investment in additional new equipment, with the capability to efficiently and reliably deliver on this new phase of development. After much research and operator test feedback, there was one brand that inspired confidence and convinced Rhodar to seal the deal – Hyundai. Rhodar has therefore taken delivery of two of Hyundai Construction Equipment Europe’s flagship A-Series crawler excavators – the HX330AL and the HX480AL – plus a host of attachments from hydraulic breakers to munchers and buckets, to lead the way on its larger earthworks and brownfield regeneration projects. John Davies, Remediation Director at Rhodar said, “Deciding on the right machinery to take us through our next phase of growth was a critical step for us. It’s a huge investment and we needed to be sure that we got exactly what we needed for the price we were prepared to pay. We approached our dealer, Taylor and Braithwaite with a specific brief – we needed a particular size and spec of vehicle and we wanted machines that would be reliable, cost efficient and powerful. “They matched us with the Hyundai excavators and when we asked around, all the operators and business owners who had worked with Hyundai only had great things to say about them. Following a highly successful test phase with some of our site teams, we were confident that these were the machines for us,” John confirmed. Rhodar was first established in the mid 1970s as an asbestos abatement company and fast became an industry-leader in that field. In recent years, the business has branched out to incorporate demolition and remediation services and now offers a comprehensive enabling works package, incorporating passive fire protection. It employs over 500 dedicated staff across 14 facilities, operating on sites nationwide. John continued, “We’ve been really impressed with the Hyundais so far. The HX330AL is a great all-rounder and a good workhorse – it’s loading wagons, breaking out and generally shifting a lot of earth round the clock. The HX480AL brings the power – it’s got the bigger bucket and is moving larger volumes – it has a lot of grunt for its size. Both machines are easy to use, the controls are simple and they’re surprisingly dextrous. “With a well-known brand like Hyundai, along with the testing we undertook, we were confident that we knew what we were getting and we’re very pleased with how the machines are running. Making the investment was definitely the right decision and we can’t fault Hyundai or the fantastic support we’ve received from Taylor and Braithwaite – they have done a great job,” John said. The HX480AL and HX330AL crawler excavators are powered by Stage 5 Cummins diesel engines and comply with the European emission standards. New smart features like IPC (Intelligent Power Control) and EPIC (Electric Pump Independent Control), enhanced cabin visibility, eco gauge and lifting mode ensure superior productivity and efficiency.

13 March 2023,Bruce Washpod right fit for Mayer Earthworks,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,bruce-washpod-right-fit-for-mayer-earthworks_5854.htm","Mayer Earthworks Ltd, a groundworks specialist based in Staffordshire, has expanded its material processing capabilities with the purchase of a Bruce WashPod from <a href=""http://www.crjservices.co.uk"">CRJ Services Ltd.</a> The WashPod, developed by Bruce Engineering Ltd, is a compact wash plant that produces three grades of cleaned aggregates and a single sand product. Bruce Engineering Ltd developed the WashPod to meet the demand of a sub-sector of the aggregate recycling industry that want to wash secondary recycled materials, to produce sized gravel and sand products, but with limited space on-site, in which to do so. The WashPod comprises of a set of modular components situated within a space similar to that of two 40ft high cube containers, making it easier and more cost-efficient to transport and install compared to larger, traditional wash plants. The system includes a dual shaft log washer that scrubs material as it enters the Pod. The cleaned material leaves the log wash and is fed onto a washing screen that further cleans and sizes the material in preparation for stockpiling. The dirt from the log wash leaves at the rear with organic matter and trash captured via the on-board Trash Screen. The sand is collected from the washing screen into a 'sand tank' which is pumped into the hydro cyclones for further cleaning and silt removal. Finally, the sand is fed onto a dewatering screen, which removes the remaining water and produces a clean sand product, with less than of 12% moisture content. The WashPod purchased by Mayer Earthworks is processing sub-40mm grab-away material, a by-product of its groundwork services. The raw material is screened with a deck screener, with the sub-40mm being fed into the WashPod Hopper. Following the scrubbing, trash removal, and rinsing process, clean 10mm, 20mm, 25-40mm aggregate products and a single coarse sand product are outputted, suitable for sale in the construction industry.

09 March 2023,Yanmar ViO38 outstanding in its field,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,yanmar-vio38-outstanding-in-its-field_5850.htm","If there is one thing that Yanmar Compact Equipment EMEA (Yanmar)’s ViO38 mini-excavator is guaranteed to offer, it’s versatility. Digging out an extensive pond in the morning, then trimming and felling roadside trees in the afternoon? That’s a typical day in the life of a ViO38. Just ask Martin Parish Contracting (MPC), a multifaceted forestry and agricultural contractor in Chulmleigh, in deepest rural North Devon. Agriculture is fundamental to Devon and its rural communities, with farming being the mainstay of the local landscape for centuries. While MPC’s owner – Martin Parish – launched his business as recently as 2016, he has been working with machinery since his teens. MPC, as is often found in the countryside, needs to be a jack of all trades, one day making household driveway alterations, to next day landscaping lakes. For these tasks and many more besides, MPC relies on a single Yanmar ViO38 mini excavator, fitting the zero-tailswing unit with various attachments and taking pleasure in regularly testing the breadth of its capabilities: “As a small business, having a multitask machine that can do everything is very important to us. We fit our Yanmar mini excavator with a variety of different buckets for landscaping and groundworks projects; a cutter for hedge and tree trimming; a wire roller and post driver for erecting our fences; a grapple for lifting timber. So many of our tasks rely on the performance of our ViO38. It’s also so easy to operate, and its cabin is really comfortable and surprisingly spacious given the machine’s compact size. This is a huge advantage given how much time we spend working in it every day.” Hydraulic Quick Coupler enables the operator to hydraulically open and close the couplers from their seat at the flick of a switch. The ViO38’s spacious and airtight cabin also features foldable pedals for more operator space, improved ergonomics, and optional air conditioning to maximise comfort around the clock. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""450"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/Yanmar CE MPC visual 3_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Tough terrain Much of MPC’s daily jobs revolve around forest management, where Martin and his team will head into Devon’s dense woodland to complete drainage and maintenance work, along with other general forestry activities. These woodlands can often be found on steep valley slopes, and having a robust, reliable unit that can maintain surefootedness while working on difficult terrain is vital, explained Martin. “The forestry work is always challenging, as nine times out of 10 the conditions are steep, wet and in the middle of nowhere. We certainly put the ViO38 mini excavator through its paces with such projects, but it has stood up to the test and proven itself capable of continuing to perform reliably and efficiently.” Yanmar has combined many clever design features to make the ViO38 very stable, including a low centre of gravity and long undercarriage to ensure a smoother, safer ride. The unit is also fitted with an EU Stage 5-compliant engine, with an output of 18.9kW at 2,200rpm, and an eco-mode that reduces its engine speed, thus lowering fuel consumption. Its fuel efficiency, Martin explains, was one of the key reasons for MPC opting for the ViO38 as its excavator of choice. Personalised support MPC originally purchased its excavator from Machine Serve, an approved Yanmar dealer also situated in Chulmleigh, conveniently just 10 minutes away from MPC’s facilities. Machine Serve specialises in selling and servicing plant and agricultural machinery for the whole of the UK’s South-West, and is responsible for providing parts, maintenance and repair services to MPC. As Martin said, “Having a local dealer is incredibly valuable to us, and the support that Phil Davey and his team offer in terms of getting us parts, maintenance and repairs for our Yanmar unit has been brilliant. They even go out of their way to help us outside of their opening hours if we need it! We are very happy with our decision to have chosen the ViO38, under Machine Serve’s guidance.” "
08 March 2023,Doosan DL420CVT-7 delivers big fuel savings,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,doosan-dl420cvt7-delivers-big-fuel-savings_5845.htm","August Lücking GmbH & Co. KG is a 123-year-old building materials producer based in north-west Germany. About two years ago, the company purchased a Doosan DL420CVT-5 wheel loader to feed materials for the brick production process. The purchase decision was based on trials that showed enormous fuel savings of more than 9L/h, which were confirmed when the new machine began operation. As a result, when the time came for a new wheel loader to be bought, the decision was made from the start: the new machine should also be a Doosan DL420CVT, this time the next generation DL420CVT-7 model. When the purchase of the original wheel loader was on the agenda about two years ago, a Doosan DL420CVT-5 was tested on site in the company’s brick factory. The requirements for the loading of clay for the bricks are particularly challenging. The clay has a high density and therefore a high weight. In addition, the material is extremely sticky and tough. In order to penetrate the material with the shovel, a high degree of even force and high traction are required, especially on wet surfaces. The tyres also play a major role here. Lücking relies on special tyres whose profile is more like that of a tractor than a wheel loader. The grooves of the tread on ‘standard tyres’ clog up quickly due to the greasy consistency. These difficult conditions also drive up fuel consumption. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/DL420CVT-5_Lucking_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> The bet The previous machine, a competitor's wheel loader with a conventional converter transmission, required an average of around 23L/h of fuel under these conditions. When the authorised signatory at Lücking, Richard Lemke, asked the wheel loader sales manager at Doosan, Marc Glesius, about the consumption to be expected under these conditions during the handover for the test operation, he cited 14L/h, a value that Lemke found difficult to believe. Richard offered Marc the following bet: “If the DL420 with the CVT transmission only consumes 14L/h, i.e. around 10 litres less, I will buy it immediately.” The rest, as they say, is history. The test consumption was the targeted 14L/h and the wheel loader has now been in service at the company for two years. Richard Lemke added, “In times of enormously high fuel and energy prices, 10L/h naturally make an enormous difference. In the last two years, the consumption of the DL420CVT-5 has levelled off at the 14L/h already determined in the test operation. We also did not record any unscheduled machine failures during this period. Therefore, only a Doosan wheel loader with a CVT transmission came into consideration when purchasing a new vehicle. We are confident that the new wheel loader can confirm these positive experiences.” CVT transmission One of the main factors behind the low fuel consumption is the variable transmission. Marc Glesius said, “This transmission combines the advantages of a mechanical and hydrostatic transmission and excludes the disadvantages of both systems. The variable transmission switches continuously from the hydrostatic drive to the mechanical drive as the speed increases and depending on the application-related requirements. The advantages that this system offers include, in particular, the excellent traction that a hydrostatic transmission offers and driving over longer distances with a direct mechanical transmission. It owes the fuel savings to the lower engine speed compared to conventional transmissions, which is necessary to achieve maximum speed and traction.” August Lücking GmbH & Co. KG Founded in 1899 from an agricultural business in Paderborn, the brickworks today employs 170 people at its production site in Warburg Bonenburg. This fifth-generation, family-owned company is a modern, efficient industrial business with its own vehicle fleet. Every year, 200,000m³ of bricks, 300,000m² of prefabricated ceilings and 50,000m² of prefabricated walls are produced, as well as staircases, balconies and prefabricated parts for special applications.

07 March 2023,Joystick control for Case C-Series Graders,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,joystick-control-for-case-cseries-graders_5846.htm","Case is launching new joystick levers for the 836C and 856C motorgraders. The new joystick control delivers improved moldboard control, along with a range of steering upgrades. The electro-hydraulic joystick control delivers a new level of moldboard control to the operator. The electro-hydraulic joysticks are built into multi-adjustable armrests on each side of the operator’s seat. Each joystick is equipped with multiple roller switches and push buttons, to control the working hydraulic and steering functions. The redesigned side console now contains additional switches that allows adjustments to the system as per the operator’s needs. The new Joystick Steering allows the operator to steer the machine using the left-hand side joystick. All steering commands, including turning the front wheels, moving the frame articulation and setting the wheel lean are available through the joystick. The also new RTC function allows the operator to return all steering commands back to the centred position, by just pushing the dedicated button. This allows the operator to control the machine without having to take their hands off the joystick levers, reducing effort and increasing productivity. Comfort Steering, when activated, reduces the number of steering wheel turns required to fully turn the machine. This improves fine control of the steering wheel and makes it easier to complete a full U-turn, with just a small turn of the steering wheel. Combined Steering brings together the various steering commands into one control function. Once activated, front wheel steering, frame articulation and wheel lean work together as the operator turns the steering wheels or moves the joystick. This provides the operator with the ability to make narrow turns without having to think about which steering command to use individually. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/Untitled-1 copy.jpg"" width=""800""/> Additionally, with activated TwinLift, operators have the possibility to move both lift cylinders by using just the right-hand joystick. TwinLift makes it easier for the operator to correct the moldboard position without having to work both joysticks. This feature also assists the operator, when grading a wider slope, as the operator can simply lift the moldboard with one joystick to reposition the machine for the next pass. Dual Power The Case C-Series graders are powered by the latest 6.7-litre, 6-cylinder FPT diesel engines. Using Hi-eSCR2 technology, they feature a maintenance-free Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCRoF) exhaust after-treatment system to comply with the European Stage 5 emissions standard. This combined system helps to create a compact engine compartment with exhaust temperatures in normal operation on average 200C below that of a traditional particulate filter. The engines are application-engineered specifically to work in a grader operation, where fast torque response is required to maintain high productivity levels. A Dual Power system offers increased engine output from fourth to sixth gear. In the Case of the 836C and 836C AWD, the engine develops 102kW (138hp) in first to third gears, shifting to 115kW (156hp) in fourth to sixth ratio. For the larger 856C and 856C AWD, the engine develops 129kW (173hp) in first to third, lifting to 142kW (190hp) in fourth to sixth gears. The power is transmitted through an Ergopower powershift transmission with six forward and three reverse gears. Automatic gear shifting optimises machine performance, leaving the operator free to concentrate on moldboard and blade work. A no-stall torque converter and 100% automatic differential lock ensures maximum traction in all operating conditions. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/64355_CASE Grader inside cab_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> All-wheel drive models also feature a Creep mode, allowing the operator to set the forward speed almost independently of engine rpm. This makes the grader suitable for compaction work, reducing the overall fleet of machines required on site, increasing efficiency and cutting cost for the customer. Both the 4WD and 6WD models are available with optional 24-inch tyres, ideal for uneven soils and when low tyre bumping effect is required. The Case moldboard design maximises controllability, with a low friction, roller-mounted encapsulated slewing ring delivering jolt-free rotation torque. This moldboard design results in fewer greasing points, which reduce the maintenance time and eliminates the need for periodic replacement of wear inserts – reducing the costs for the customer. An A-Shape frame virtually eliminates lateral stress in off-set positioning and the central saddle can be set hydraulically in five different positions. The operator can rotate the blade over 90 degrees to each side without any mechanical interference. An infinitely variable radius blade reduces traction effort and improves material roll in finishing operations. All C-Series Case graders can be equipped from the factory prepared for the most commonly used blade control solutions. The grader can be delivered to the customer in a plug-and-play set-up, allowing rapid installation of 2D and 3D machine control systems. These automatic blade control systems allow even the most inexperienced operator to achieve higher productivity and more constant output. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""528"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/64355_CASE Grader launch_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/>Operator comfort The machines feature a rear-mounted, low-profile, ROPS/FOPS cab with heated and air-suspended seat, that delivers best-in-class levels of operator comfort and visibility, while keeping overall machine height low to avoid transport concerns. Wide, tinted glass provides an excellent view around the machines, with a full view of the mouldboard for the seated operator. A rear-view camera provides increased safety when reversing, reducing the need for the operator to continually turn when working. To further boost the productivity, profitability and uptime of the revised 836C & 856C, Case has available a range of connected and non-connected after-sales services, Case Service Solutions, which supports customers’ experiences of Case equipment. The complete fleet management tool Case SiteWatchTM enables geolocation, fleet security using geo-fences and unauthorised use alerts and flexible reporting. This includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as fuel consumption, utilisation rate, machine hours and idle time, so productivity and profitability can be monitored and optimised. The data is easily accessible via a portal. "

In what has been a mammoth, first-of-its-kind practice for Terex, the successful charter was to ensure customers get their machines in these times of logistical and supply chain delays. Claire Hamilton, Category Director – Metal Fabrications & Logistics, Terex Supply Management and Transport said, “Towards the end of last year, our RORO roll-on/roll-off capacity to Australia was suspended due to port congestion, backlog due to Covid, and increased global demand. Vessels were overbooked and backlog was not reducing. While we were provided with an allocation of slots, this did not meet the demand for our products. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""600"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/TEREX_CHARTERS_VESSEL_3_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> “We decided to research alternative options for getting our equipment to our Australian customers, which was a huge undertaking,” Claire continued. “Our equipment varies in size and weight and not only is lifting them on, and off vessels difficult, safety of doing so is always our top priority. After exploring various options, we found a solution that enabled our machines to be tracked and secured onto a platform, which would be lifted by cranes and lowered into the hull of the ship.” Prior to loading, the Terex Sourcing and Supply team worked with various stakeholders—including safety, engineering, logistics, operations teams within Terex, as well as external transport and shipping providers—with bi-weekly meetings to plan every detail. Specific engineering information was provided for each machine, and dates agreed among all parties for getting machines to port. In total, 30 Terex machines weighing 1,092mtons / 5,012cbm were delivered to the Port of Southampton. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""600"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/TEREX_CHARTERS_VESSEL_5_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Even when at the port, support was provided to transfer the machines from storage to dockside, providing solutions as problems occurred, with Terex service engineers checking machines prior to loading and supporting stevedores at the dockside and on the vessel. Loading to the vessel was performed by tandem lift operation of the ship’s cranes and lifting platform. Embarkation and disembarkation to and from the ramp was undertaken using ramps on the quayside and in the ship’s hold. In total, it took eight days for all 30 machines to be safely loaded to the vessel. Claire summarised, “From the planning stages right through to the enormous operation of loading our equipment onto the vessel, all stakeholders worked proactively to ensure that our 30 machines were loaded safely to the vessel with no incidents or accidents. It was a huge undertaking – constant collaboration between internal and external parties, working as a team, was a key contributor to success.” The machines are currently enroute and expected to arrive in Australia in early March.

13 February 2023,Upgraded cab for Hyundai forklifts,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,upgraded-cab-for-hyundai-forklifts_5806.htm","Hyundai Material Handling has unveiled a range of Heavy Line diesel forklift trucks, with an improved cab environment, EU Stage 5 emissions-compliant engines and the option of Hyundai’s HiMate telematic monitoring system. There are 10 models on offer, with lift capacities of 7-30 tonnes and they build on the successful launch last year of the lighter models in the diesel forklift line-up. Features includes 10 machines with lift capacities of 7 to 30 tonnes, an improved cab environment with additional space and visibility, EU Stage 5 Hyundai and Cummins diesel engines, load-sensing Main Control Valves for improved operator control and efficiency, and Hyundai HiMate telematics for fleet management. Operator comfort Designed after extensive consultation with customers, Hyundai’s next generation forklift cab features a revised console layout and a smaller steering wheel, to deliver increased working space for the operator. A one-piece constant radius windscreen provides improved forward visibility without edge distortion, while fully glazed doors also contribute to a reduced in-cab noise level, cut by up to 5.9dB. A new console incorporates a colour display with easy access buttons for regularly used functions. The multifunction screen delivers relevant machine operating data and can provide in-cab service alert and diagnostic codes when required. A second 7-inch display shows the rear-view camera images. The new load sensing Main Control Valve provides increased control, with fingertip levers delivering improved response to operator input.

10 February 2023,Hydrogen-fuelled JCB on UK roads,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,hydrogenfuelled-jcb-on-uk-roads_5802.htm","The world’s first digger, powered by a hydrogen combustion engine, will soon be on UK roads and building sites following recent government approval, helping to decarbonise the UK’s construction industry. The UK government has given special dispensation, under a vehicle special order, that allows JCB, the British construction equipment manufacturer, to test and use its world-first hydrogen-powered backhoe loader on UK roads. The vehicle special order given by the Transport Secretary allows JCB to test its new hydrogen-powered machine on the public highway. This backhoe loader is the first of its kind and offers a pioneering solution to help reduce emissions on construction sites. With 25% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions coming from the built environment, it’s vital the entire construction industry looks to decarbonise at every stage. The digger's approval not only marks a new direction for reducing emissions but will help grow the economy, with JCB having already created 150 new jobs in the Midlands with the promise of hundreds more as the company’s <a href=""https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,jcb-leading-the-way-with-hydrogen-power_5684.htm"" target=""_blank"">hydrogen project</a> advances. These developments also help to equip the country with the skills and expertise to not only reduce emissions but provide learning to would-be apprentices, future-proofing the nation’s skillset. Technology and Decarbonisation Minister Jesse Norman said, “From cars to construction sites, industry has a vital role in decarbonising our economy and creating green jobs and prosperity. JCB’s investment in greener equipment is a great example of how industry can make this happen, using alternative fuels to generate sustainable economic growth. JCB’s prototype hydrogen-powered backhoe loader is an important first step in the construction industry’s efforts to decarbonise in what is a ‘hard to decarbonise’ sector,” Minister Norman continued. “Hydrogen combustion machines can play a vital role in reducing carbon emissions in settings where other types of clean power may not be the most practical or efficient.” JCB Chairman Lord Bamford said, “Securing this vehicle special order from the Department for Transport is an important first step in getting JCB machines that are powered by hydrogen combustion engines to and from British building sites using the public highway. It’s an endorsement that JCB is on the right path in pursuit of its net zero ambitions. “JCB’s hydrogen-powered backhoe loader is a world first in our industry, a digger with a purpose-engineered internal combustion engine that uses hydrogen gas as the energy source,” Lord Bamford added. “It’s a real breakthrough – a zero CO2 fuel providing the power to drive the pistons in an internal combustion engine, a technology that’s been around for over 100 years, a technology that we are all familiar with. I am delighted that the Decarbonisation Minister will witness for himself the first drive of a hydrogen-powered digger on the open road. It’s clear to me that, following this visit, he’ll appreciate the potential for hydrogen internal combustion engines to help deliver net zero targets more quickly, while adding jobs and contributing wider economic benefits to the construction sector. Yesterday, Minister Norman visited JCB’s headquarters in Rocester, Staffordshire, where he saw the digger take to the road near the factory where it was manufactured. He inspected one of JCB’s hydrogen combustion engines, which are the product of a £100 million investment project by JCB to build on its innovative British engineering and develop new lower emission powertrains. The pace of JCB’s hydrogen developments showcase a level of commitment to decarbonisation that is needed across all sectors of the UK economy. Hydrogen is just one of the many ways that the UK government is looking to accelerate decarbonisation. The recent announcement of second phase of the Tees Valley Hydrogen Hub builds on previous commitments to best explore how hydrogen can be utilised as an alternative fuel, whether that be through the use of hydrogen fuel cells on road or hydrogen internal combustion engines for off-road construction machinery. Late last year, the British manufacturer recently revealed a <a href=""https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,jcb-unveils-first-mobile-hydrogen-refueller_5579.htm"" target=""_blank"">new mobile hydrogen refueller</a>. The work seen as part of the hub in Tees Valley will work to address challenges such as providing refuelling infrastructure at scale and integrating that within a wider decarbonised energy network. As hydrogen technologies develop here in the UK, it’s vital this knowledge helps shape the next generation of apprentices. During this year’s National Apprenticeship Week (6 to 12 February 2023), hydrogen continues to be a source of opportunity for new skills and jobs to be developed. JCB’s expanding apprenticeship programme shows how apprentices can play a part in shaping a net zero future, building on the recent government commitment to deliver £300,000 towards the teaching of hydrogen skills as part of the Tees Valley Hydrogen Transport hub.

09 February 2023,Parkinson Plant Services’ used Volvo EC140E,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,parkinson-plant-services-used-volvo-ec140e_5796.htm","Tom Parkinson, Managing Director of Macclesfield-based Parkinson Plant Services, chose a used, 14-tonne Volvo excavator from SMT GB for his first foray into larger equipment and has not looked back. Since breaking out on his own in 2017, Tom Parkinson’s groundworks contracting business, Parkinson Plant Services, has gone from strength to strength. The groundworks and excavation specialist has remained busy throughout the pandemic and is now taking on more and larger jobs, from drainage and landscaping to mass excavation and earthmoving projects. Larger jobs required Tom to add a larger machine to his fleet of compact excavators and wheeled loaders, and he immediately knew he wanted a Volvo. “I have operated plant ever since I left school. I have driven machines of all sizes and brands and Volvo has always been a personal favourite,” he said. “When you are spending a whole day in a machine, you want it to be a nice and comfortable machine to drive. Volvos are built with the operator in mind and just tick all the right boxes.” Tom began his search on the typical used equipment listing and auction sites, before calling SMT GB’s used equipment specialist Pelham Milligan in February 2022. “I happened to ring up Pelham one day and said ‘I’m looking for a machine in the 14 tonne size class. Can you help me?’ Straight away, he rang me back and said, ‘I’ve got this one down at our Used Equipment Centre in Bruntingthorpe. Pop over, have a look, and tell me what you think,’” Tom recounted. Two weeks later, he took delivery. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/usedvolvosmt_3edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> The machine in question was a used Volvo EC140E crawler excavator – a current model with only 4,000 hours on the clock. SMT GB had carried out a full valet and service of the machine and Tom requested some extra work to suit his needs. This included the addition of some chevron decals to the counterweight for improved safety awareness on site and a cab guard for protection against vandalism. As it was his first large machine purchase, Tom specifically wanted a used machine. “I think it’s good to go for a used machine, especially for the first one, so you can see exactly what you’re getting before you buy it and you don’t have to wait very long for it to arrive,” he said. “I was a bit unsure as it was my first big purchase, but SMT really helped me out. They showed me how it would work and what they offered with the machine, which made it so easy. I felt as if they couldn’t do enough for me,” he continues. Tom had also looked at another used Volvo from a non-authorised reseller, but the overall package was not as good. SMT GB gave him free delivery to wherever he wanted, threw in a brand-new ditching bucket, and offered a one-stop shop for servicing and parts. “It was a no-brainer to go with SMT GB. The Customer Support Agreement means I don’t have to worry about servicing the machine. When it’s time, SMT GB will come out and do that wherever the machine is,” he explained. “A used machine is still a significant investment,” he continues, “so the warranty also gives me that peace of mind, that if anything was to go wrong, we’ve got that covered.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/usedvolvosmt_2edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> As good as new So far, Tom’s used Volvo EC140E excavator has been performing perfectly and has even been mistaken for a brand new one. “Everything is still tight on it regarding the pins and bushes,” he said. “It feels like a new machine and the chevrons looks great, so a lot of people have commented ‘Oh, you have a new machine!’” It has proven just as easy and comfortable to operate as Tom remembered from his previous experience with Volvo machines and he has been particularly impressed with the fuel efficiency. “With other machines, I’ve easily gone through a tank of fuel in a day, but I did a bulk excavation job over in Macclesfield recently where the EC140E didn’t even use half a tank. It really helps to keep costs down, especially given the new laws for white diesel,” he confirmed. Another pleasant surprise for Tom has been the EC140E’s compact footprint, enabling it to work effectively on confined jobsites and making transport between sites easier. “I did look into the zero tail-swing option as I was a bit worried about being able to manoeuvre the machine on tight, residential jobs, but it’s actually got quite a short swing radius on it, despite being a conventional design. It’s also quite narrow, so it’s good for working on small sites as well as larger ones, and is relatively easy to transport,” Tom explained. “I’m very pleased with the machine and I would definitely recommend SMT GB and Volvo to others. It has been a great addition to our business and is probably the best purchase we’ve had within our company,” he concluded. "

The machine that stood out as perfect for the job was the HL960A – and Skipway swiftly ordered two of them. Matthew Heatrick, Systems Manager of Skipway said, “We’ve only ever used Hyundais here at Skipway – mostly 770 models over the years – so we knew that we liked and trusted the brand, and wanted to stick with them for our next purchase. Already we’re seeing the benefits of upgrading to the new A-series machines – their fuel economy is so much better, they’re using half the diesel of the previous ones which obviously makes a huge difference to our finances.” The two machines have been earmarked and specified for different uses – one of the HL960As will be based at a materials recovery site in Belfast and used for the heavy-duty tasks of stockpiling waste and loading rubble and timber. This machine has been fitted with longer arms and supplied with different bucket attachments to ensure the HL960A can tackle any load, terrain and material in its path. The second HL960A will be used for waste transportation at a second Skipway site in Newtownards, where flexible and robust machines are the key to running an efficient operation.   <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/skipaseries_3.jpg"" width=""800""/> Matthew continued, “A typical day on one of our sites is long and complex, so we need machines that can live up to the challenge. The A-series has been above and beyond what we expected and our operators have been extremely complimentary about them. The main feedback has been about how comfortable they are – the joystick controls are really easy to use and the visibility is much better than any machine they’ve used before. From our side, the camera system gives us peace of mind that the machines will be operated safely and the fuel economy is obviously a big plus. We are very impressed with the new A-Series and these first machines definitely won’t be our last.” Acquired by the R. Heatrick Group in 2012, Skipway Waste Management & Recycling provides demolition, aggregate, haulage and skip hire services throughout Northern Ireland. With a focus on sustainability, Skipway’s current waste recycling rate is 92% equating to over 45,000 tonnes, helping the company to deliver on its promise of building a more sustainable future for Northern Ireland. Supplied by Hyundai Construction Equipment dealer, Northern Lift Trucks, the HL960A Wheel Loader is part of Hyundai’s flagship A-series – a fresh generation of construction equipment that complies with European emission levels. This stage V machine was awarded the SaMoTer Technical Innovation Award in the ‘Medium Wheel Loaders’ category and is suitable for general construction applications and heavy-duty work on industrial, mining and quarrying projects.

02 February 2023,UK’s first Cat Certified Machine Rebuild,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,uks-first-cat-certified-machine-rebuild_5784.htm","One of the UK’s leading recycling and waste management companies has given Finning the green light to complete the UK’s first Certified Machine Rebuild (CMR) on a 15-year-old Cat 836 landfill compactor to give it a new lease of life ensuring that it can continue operating for another 15 years.  FCC Environment owns and operates over 200 recycling, treatment, and disposal facilities across the UK, managing more than 8.5 million tonnes of waste for their customers, which include over 72 local authorities across North Yorkshire, Suffolk and Essex. FCC’s waste processing fleet alone comprises 500 machines including landfill compactors, wheeled excavators, track type loaders and articulated dump trucks, with Cat equipment making up almost half.  One of these machines, a Cat 836 landfill compactor, was purchased from Finning in 2007 with a full repair and maintenance programme, which proved instrumental in keeping the machine operating effectively for around 15 years whilst minimising downtime. However, when the machine’s transmission failed in late 2022 FCC Group Plant Manager, Bill Stone, began discussions with the Finning team on the best solution for a replacement machine package. This included looking at buying another new machine as well as considering the option to carry out a full CMR, which is the highest-level Cat certified rebuild available.  Adam Walker, engine and drivetrain product manager at Finning is overseeing the project. He said, “Sustainability is now at the forefront of the waste industry, so we’ve seen a shift in demand towards companies requesting remanufactured or reconditioned parts for their machines, or for the entire machine to be rebuilt. This is the first machine rebuild that FCC has commissioned, but the company now plans for this approach to become an integral part of their fleet management succession plan because it enables them to demonstrate a clear commitment to improving the environmental impact of their operations and reducing emissions in the drive to net-zero. Less energy “Rebuilding a machine instead of buying new requires 85% less energy, uses 86% less water and generates around 61% fewer greenhouse gases,” Adam continued. “Plus, we recover and recycle over 65% of the original machine, so it’s ready to be used as a replacement part in another machine. Not only that, but customers choosing a rebuild machine option will typically save around 50-60% on the cost compared with buying a new machine. While remanufactured parts, of which there are around 8,000+ Cat certified ones available, can be up to 60% less than the cost of a brand new one.” Bill Stone said, “We have a commitment to run our operation in an environmentally and socially responsible way, and by choosing to rebuild and give our assets a second life rather than buy new, we are helping to meet that commitment. Our mobile plant fleet is key to our operation, so it is essential these assets are managed effectively, and Finning plays a vital part in that.  “It is because of their record of strong aftermarket support and our collaborative relationship with the team at Finning that we have complete confidence in the effectiveness and efficiency of their rebuilds and they will play a crucial part in our succession planning moving forward,” Bill added. Once complete, the Cat 836 will be ‘as new’ so will offer the same machine lifespan as a new machine. Machine rebuilds are fast becoming a recommended approach for firms’ fleet management, providing a sustainable and commercial option alongside investment in new machines. Finning has seen their number of machines rebuilds double year on year, with their specialist rebuild engineers completing hundreds over the last three years. "
02 February 2023,Jan De Nul’s Hitachi ZX690LCH-7,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,jan-de-nuls-hitachi-zx690lch7_5778.htm","Jan De Nul Group is utilising a new ZX690LCH-7 to work alongside other Hitachi machines on a specialist earthmoving project at a reservoir situated at Trois-Ponts, in the province of Liège, Belgium. The new Zaxis-7 model has joined three other large (an EX1200-6, ZX870LCR-5 and ZX490LCH-6) and four medium (three ZX350LC-6s and a ZX225USLC-6) excavators. They are scheduled to excavate one million cubic metres of materials over a nine-month period at the lower end of the site. These are being hauled a short distance uphill, where they are being used to: raise the height of the reservoir by 3m; stabilise the surrounding dikes by reducing the gradient from 66.67% to 50%; and ultimately increase the capacity of the reservoir by 7.5%. As Jan De Nul Group’s Site Manager at Trois-Ponts, Bert Dierick had some freedom to choose the machines deployed on the project. “This is a great job for Jan De Nul, as it is quite specialist and not many other companies can do this type of work within the strict timescale. “The construction machinery is kept on the fleet indefinitely and some machines have 10-12,000 hours before they are moved on. However, this will depend on several factors, such as their condition, resale value and if they are needed for a specific job. As an example, a 14,000-hour ZX670LCH-3 was recently replaced by the ZX690LCH-7, which we needed with a ripper attachment for this project. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/_P6A1018_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> “When my colleagues consider a new machine for purchase, I give them my opinion,” Bert continued. “The Hitachi excavators are the key to the production on this site and they are working well. They are strong, reliable and the level of availability is very high.” Kris De Backer, Technical Supervisor at Jan De Nul Group, is the main point of contact for the Belgian Hitachi dealer, Luyckx – a partner he holds in high regard. “The biggest benefit of running a Hitachi fleet is the excellent service provided by our dealer – thanks to Luyckx, we will always buy more Hitachi machines. If there’s an issue with any of the large excavators, it costs us money because the dump trucks – and the whole process – will come to a stop. Therefore, reliability is the key. In addition, our operators never complain about the Hitachi machines or request that we should buy any other brands. In fact, they say that Hitachi makes the best large excavator in the market.” Andy Moreels, a long-standing excavator operator with 23 years’ experience within Jan De Nul Group, has experience of operating all of the Zaxis series machines (from the -1 to -7 range) and his favourite model is the ZX350LC-6 for its “versatility and comfort”. Of the ZX690LCH-7, Andy said, “Overall, this is an excellent machine. The comfort is much better than previous versions, such as the seat and the way in which it moves as one with the console. I also like the adjustable joysticks, and the monitor and camera have been improved, such as the bird’s-eye view with everything now visible on screen. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/_P6A1371_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> “The digging power and strength of the machine are excellent,” Andy added. “I can load trucks relatively quickly and the response is good thanks to the hydraulics. It’s also easy to manoeuvre, even with the heavy ripper attachment I’m using now. There is even less noise in the cab, due to the distance from the engine compartment behind me.” It’s not possible to work on the site from November onwards – as it’s 500m above sea level – and so even though the earthmoving will be complete, the medium excavators will be unable to finish the landscaping work until February 2023. The project is being executed by the civil division of Jan De Nul Group on behalf of Engie, the Belgian market leader for electricity, natural gas and energy services. The upper reservoirs are part of the Hydroelectric Power Station at Coo-Trois-Ponts. Turbines are used to pump water to the upper reservoirs when there is a power surplus. When power demand is high, hydro power from the upper reservoirs is used to power the same turbines. The dykes at the upper reservoirs were raised and widened to increase capacity on the one hand and, by widening, to meet the highest seismic standards on the other. "

The company has since grown into somewhat of a force majeure within the sector, with many subsidiary companies within the Thomas Group – in fact, there are seven other Thomas Plant divisions, and the company has no plans to slow down its future growth. Thomas Plant Hire boasts more than 3,000 machines within its hire fleet including a wide range of excavators ranging from 1.5-tonne up to 50-tonne, which include market-leading machines from OEMs Hitachi, Caterpillar, Kobelco, Komatsu and Liebherr. Also, the company owns a very impressive fleet of 72 dozers with another 20 on order.  Ian McMillan, Head of business development at the Thomas Group reported that the company had invested in the region of £50m in new plant and machinery during 2022 and is planning to invest a similar figure during 2023. The company is also a big investor in ‘machine technology’ with its OnGrade Machine Control division, which offers training, sales and hire for Intelligent GPS Machine Control systems, which include Leica, Topcon and Trimble. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/xwatchsys1_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Thomas Plant is also a big advocate of safety and the company has around 65 Xwatch systems installed on a variety of excavators, with lots more on order as it future-proofs its fleet. The systems have been installed by Xwatch partner Gareth James owner of GJ Plant and Auto Electrics and Xwatch’s, sister company Fitzgerald Plant Services, based in Cwmbran, Wales. In the last two weeks alone, Gareth has installed 13 Xwatch systems on behalf of Thomas Plant.  Ian McMillan said, “We chose the Xwatch systems as they have Network Rail approval, which is a very valuable endorsement for the products and allows us to operate on Network Rail projects. The backup and service we receive from both Gareth James and Fitzgerald Plant Services are second to none. When working with tier one contractors they mandate that an engineer is on-site within a maximum of four hours of an issue, with Gareth, Fitzgerald Plant Services and the Xwatch, support team this service is guaranteed, although we have next to no issues with the Xwatch systems.”  "
27 January 2023,High demand for construction workers,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,high-demand-for-construction-workers_5769.htm","Against a backdrop of economic challenge, rising materials and labour costs, new figures from the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) reveal that almost 225,000 extra workers will be required to meet UK construction demand by 2027. CITB’s annual Construction Skills Network (CSN) report shows that 224,900 extra workers (44,980 a year) will be needed to meet UK construction demand between now and 2027. Furthermore, construction output is set to grow for all nations and regions, however, recession is expected in 2023 with slow growth returning in 2024.  The major sectors for demand are private housing, infrastructure, and repair and maintenance. If projected growth is met, by 2027 the number of people working in construction will be 2.67m. The report highlights that construction is expected to remain a sector where there is demand for workers despite the current economic uncertainty. As a result, recruitment, training, development and upskilling remain major priorities for the industry for 2023 and beyond. CITB is responding by investing in apprenticeships, launching a range of targeted initiatives and working collaboratively with industry, to help the construction sector have a skilled, competent, and inclusive workforce. Tim Balcon, CITB Chief Executive said, “The latest CSN report clearly shows that despite current economic uncertainty, recruiting and developing the workforce remains vital to ensure the industry can contribute to economic growth. “We know the next 18 months won’t be easy, however, I remain inspired by the construction industry’s resilience shown in the pandemic and throughout 2022,” Tim continued. “In short, it makes clear that the need to recruit and retain talent in the sector has never been greater. Whether that’s for building the homes the country needs, constructing energy and transport infrastructure or retrofitting the built environment to help drive down energy bills and meet net zero targets. “To bolster industry’s resilience, CITB will strive to attract and train a diverse range of recruits for industry, equipping them with modern skills for rewarding construction careers,” Tim added. “I look forward to working with and supporting industry and stakeholders in the challenging times ahead and to emerging stronger when the recession ends.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/diggerukconstr_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> To help directly address these challenges and maximise the opportunities which will arise, CITB has invested almost £50m of Levy to support over 22,000 apprentices to help them join the industry; while grants have helped support over 16,000 learners to complete their qualifications. Direct funding has provided grants over 269,000 training courses and in total £97m has been invested in grant funding by CITB, to make it as easy as possible for employers to recruit and retain their skilled workforce. CITB continues to provide targeted support to SMEs through grant and funding, and through support in accessing training and funding. Since April 2022, CITB’s engagement team has supported SMEs on 26,976 occasions, supporting them to continue to train during the current economic uncertainty. CITB also offers funding aimed specifically at smaller companies such as the Skills and Training Fund. Companies with fewer than 250 PAYE employees can access up to £25,000 annually (depending on their size). By the end of quarter two 2022, £3.9m had been invested in companies via this fund. CITB’s Scottish Academy for Construction Opportunities (SACO) commission has awarded £1.3m across the Highlands and Islands; while England Construction Opportunities (ECO) commission has awarded a total of just over £1.8m. This investment will directly help address the construction industry’s skills gap, increase employment retention, and provide vital support to new starters at the beginning of their construction careers, by promoting work experience for new entrants to the industry. Experience Hubs across England and Wales are creating a talent pipeline to meet the needs of local construction employers and to support construction career opportunities for people from local communities. Further CITB initiatives range from localised solutions for funding and training like our employer network pilot project, available to more than 3,800 levy-registered construction businesses across five locations in England, Scotland and Wales; to a £10.5m Leadership and Management commission which will provide funded courses for businesses of all sizes to equip supervisors and managers with a recognised Leadership and Management qualification.  Training remains a key focus, which is why CITB has invested in National Construction College (NCC) sites, to meet the industry’s specialist training needs. By focusing the curriculum on unmet demand, we are looking to build capacity for the industry, which has resulted in a 25% increase in the number of people trained to date. Our data shows that 96% of CITB apprentices have secured employment or progressed in education, with over 90% remaining in the sector.  Tim Balcon concluded, “This coordinated and comprehensive approach to helping recruit, train, develop and upskill talent, whilst continuing to work collaboratively with industry and stakeholders means CITB will continue to play a central role in supporting an industry that is a key driver of the UK economy through these challenging times.” "
27 January 2023,Kubota’s record-breaking year,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,kubotas-recordbreaking-year_5768.htm","In a year that saw Kubota celebrate a quarter of a century as the number one supplier of mini-excavators to the UK and Ireland markets, this success cements Kubota’s reputation for providing robust, high-performing, and reliable machinery. In addition to machinery sales, the manufacturer had many reasons to celebrate across 2022.

From a product demo week showcasing some of the latest advancements in Kubota machinery, to a range of competitions and giveaways designed to say thank you to its loyal fanbase, the manufacturer made sure its milestone year was one to remember. And as much as Kubota celebrated its legacy throughout 2022, it also made significant investment into its future. The business recently unveiled plans to boost production at its primary mini-excavator manufacturing plant in Japan, via investment totalling more than £100m. The expansion of Hirakata Plant will see Kubota increase its annual production capability from 48,800 to 78,000 units, helping the manufacturer meet both existing demand in Europe and North America and predicted increases in demand in Asia. Kubota has also opened the doors to a new European Parts Centre in France, which will significantly strengthen its parts supply system to Europe. Representing an investment of more than 15 million euros, the centre ensures seamless supply of parts to dealers and distributors across the continent, including the UK and Ireland. Rob White, division manager for construction at Kubota UK said, “As we look back on a record-breaking year for Kubota, it is with much excitement for what the future holds.

Just three months after Dawsongroup | emc bought six of the JCB Pothole Pro machines, Managing Director Glen Carruthers has signed a deal for another five for hire across the UK. The Pothole Pro has gained widespread recognition for fixing potholes permanently, first time, without the need for labour intensive repair methods or additional expensive machinery. Dawsongroup | emc is JCB’s official rental partner for the Pothole Pro and the additional machines, bought from dealer TC Harrison JCB, are now being rolled out for rent or contract hire by local authorities and contractors across the country who urgently need to tackle the scourge of potholes. Demand for the machines is at an all-time high, especially given the Asphalt Industry Alliance’s (AIA) Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance survey estimating that there are £12.64 billion worth of outstanding road repairs in England and Wales – equating to a nine-year backlog. Dawsongroup | emc Managing Director Glen Carruthers said, “We were so impressed with the JCB Pothole Pro that we have ordered an additional five machines which will double the size of our fleet within a five-month period. Every day we are talking to our customers asking them how to improve the way they do things and the Pothole Pro fits perfectly into that profile. The JCB Pothole Pro eradicates potholes easily with one machine in a more efficient, cost effective and safer way than more traditional methods. “Potholes continue to be a major issue for our country, and we are determined to help fix the problem by giving customers the option to hire a JCB Pothole Pro from Dawsongroup,” Glen added. JCB Pothole Pro Sales Manager Ben Rawding said, “Dawsongroup’s order for a further five JCB Pothole Pro machines really shows its commitment to helping tackle the scourge of potholes. JCB’s solution is simple and cost effective and fixes potholes permanently, first time, and we are excited that such a major hirer continues to recognise the machine’s benefits. City councils, large rural county councils and Tier 1 highways contractors across the UK have invested in the Pothole Pro, and all are seeing significantly more defects being fixed, economically, permanently and safely. In fact, Stoke-on-Trent City Council – the first authority to invest in the Pothole Pro – has repaired seven years’ worth of defects in just 12 months.” Tests with contractors and local authorities show the JCB Pothole Pro can complete a pothole repair four times quicker than standard methods in less than eight minutes – equivalent to 700 potholes per month. With a 40km/h travel speed, the machine can also rapidly relocate between sites without additional transport costs.  The Pothole Pro can prepare up to 250m<sup>2</sup> of roadway in a single shift, or 5,000m<sup>3</sup> per month and allows the contractor or local authority to cut the defect, crop the edges and clean the hole with one machine – mechanising jobs traditionally done by pothole gangs and delivering up to a 50% cut in daily costs, reckons JCB. Safety is also improved as the gang does not have to complete the handheld cutting and breaking, eliminating the risk of hand arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Dawsongroup | emc, previously known as Dawsongroup | sweepers, is part of a global group of companies committed to providing an extensive product range, and first-class customer service across the supply chain. Their Smarter Asset Strategy is a solution that allows businesses to minimise risk while improving cash flow, efficiency and agility. "

The new 8.5-tonne A-Series machine proved to be the perfect fit – so good in fact, that Kilmac ordered three. Bert Hope, Group Buyer for Kilmac Ltd said, “We reviewed a lot of different machines based on price, performance and operator reviews and the Hyundai stood out a mile in all three areas. The operators were extremely positive about the machine’s workability and manoeuvrability, its responsiveness and, above all, the fact it’s comfortable and nice to drive. “I’m of the opinion that if I’ve got happy operators, the job will turn out better for the customer and so their feedback was very important to us,” Bert continued. “Some of our drivers have been working on sites for 30+ years and really know what makes a good machine.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""600"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/A-HX85A-RGB-7-Kilmac Large.jpeg"" width=""800""/> Along with a positive response to the excavator’s visibility, camera system and operator comfort, the Kilmac team discovered further benefits to the HX85A too. “These mini excavators pack a surprising punch – they dig extremely well, excavating deep but still working in a really tight space,” Bert added. “They’re spacious too – the cab is the same size as a 14-tonne machine which means it’s a much more pleasant environment for our operators to spend long days in. “But the biggest surprise has been how easy it has been to obtain parts for the machines. Especially in the current climate, this was a concern for us, but everything has been swift and efficient – the after-service care has been brilliant. We will certainly be purchasing more Hyundais in the future – they’re comfortable, easy to use, competitive on price and the safety features are second to none,” Bert said. Supplied by Hyundai Construction Equipment dealer, Agritrac, the HX85A compact excavator is part of the Hyundai A-Series – a fresh generation of construction equipment that complies with the European emission levels. The HX85A comes with many functions and features adopted from larger Hyundai excavators, which makes it a top-performing and very user-friendly machine that finds its ideal work environment on urban job sites.

09 January 2023,Baumer smart sensors,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,baumer-smart-sensors_5724.htm","The ever-increasing trend of automating mobile machines and heavy vehicles requires more sophisticated and efficient components, especially sensors which are expected to deliver all the required functions such as safety-relevant data with optimum precision. Often these demands are 24/7 and in challenging outdoor environments. A good example is waste disposal vehicles that automatically lift and empty waste containers, for both industrial and domestic applications. To meet the requirements of efficiency, operational safety and without accidents, whilst also complying with current Machine Directives, sensors must reliably interact with each other to ensure both operator and system safety.    To meet these demands Sensor and Instrumentation specialist Baumer has developed a range of smart sensors which can reportedly help to improve the performance of your mobile machines ensuring advanced automation across industry sectors such as waste, construction, agriculture and general materials handling. Waste disposal Waste disposal is an important part of the wider focus on ‘greener, more sustainable’ solutions and mobile vehicles which can automatically lift, empty and store waste containers are being successfully deployed. With over 150,000 systems installed across Europe, Swiss-based Villager Entsorgungssysteme is recognised as being an expert in automated waste disposal systems including above and underground containers, to lifting and crane systems as well as mobile container cleaning systems. A ‘Speed Lifter’ is one example which incorporates a specialised gripper to lift and hold waste containers with fully automated, gentle handling. In its search for the ideal sensor, the manufacturer found what they were looking for in the Baumer range. The Baumer GCA5 cable transducer was one of the sensors selected as it’s designed for challenging outdoor applications and features a robust housing along with corrosion resistant stainless steel cable. The GCA5 is one of a wide range of robust sensors, from inclination and boom angle sensors to presence checks and position feedback of moving parts, along with sensors to monitor load, hydraulic liquid levels and pressure. Other sensors for mobile automation applications include those which are available as redundant variant and those designed to endure strong shocks and vibration whilst withstanding contamination and temperature fluctuations. These are E1 compliant with C5-M corrosion resistance and protection up to IP69K along with other sensors which are ISO 13849 compliant developed for functional safety applications. "

06 January 2023,Doosan DX255NLC helps protect Norderney Island,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,doosan-dx255nlc-helps-protect-norderney-island_5717.htm","Norderney is one of the most popular islands on the German North Sea coast with tourists. To keep it that way, it is necessary to carry out regular maintenance measures to preserve the island's stability in the long term. The company, Tell Bau GmbH from Norden, using a new Doosan DX255NLC excavator, has just completed a project to implement one of the measures used to protect the island.  The project, which lasted about four months, was commissioned by the Nlwkn (Lower Saxony Water Management, Coastal Defence and Nature Conservation agency). It called for the reinforcement of the revetment in the east of the island. A revetment is a passive structure which protects against erosion caused by wave action, storm surge and currents. The project required the old revetment to be dismantled and a new revetment made of hydraulic rubble stone in full grouting to be constructed. At the same time, the asphalt revetment had to be renewed. The Doosan DX255NLC was used in various areas. Its tasks included both demolition and earthworks. The Doosan excavator was also used to drive sheet piles into the ground along the full length of the construction section using a Movax SG50V pile driver. In addition, utilising the on-board TopCon 3D system, the excavator produced the dyke shapes required for installation and profiling of the revetment. The Doosan DX255NLC has an operating weight of around 25 tonnes, is equipped with the 192kW six-cylinder DL06 engine from Doosan, and has a maximum digging depth of 6.81m. The DX255NLC at Tell Bau is fitted with a TopCon 3D control system and can be equipped with a Movax SG50P pile driver and a PowerTilt. The special feature of this NLC (Narrow Long Crawler) excavator is its transport width of 3m. This allows the excavator to be transported with a permanent excess width exemption in Germany. "
05 January 2023,Piletec adds new piling hammers to its hire fleet,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,piletec-adds-new-piling-hammers-to-its-hire-fleet_5716.htm","Two new piling attachments promising to save civil engineering contractors time and money have been added to its UK hire offering by piling equipment specialist Piletec. These are an ICE Side-Grip Hammer by Dieseko Group and a DX20 Excavator-Mounted Impact Hammer, which are designed to safely drive long sheet piles and steel tubes, and when used together are capable of installing sheet piles up to 16m long. Both new piling hammers benefit contractors as they provide the ability to install long sheet piles, negating the need to employ a specialist piling contractor. Said to be robust and easy to fit and operate, the Side-Grip Hammer is safer than other methods of installing sheet piles as the pile is picked up firmly by the hammer, eliminating the need for additional personnel.   Compared to other Side-Grip Hammers, which can take a day or longer to install, the ICE Side-Grip can be fully set up in approximately 2 to 3 hours, including setting excavator flows, hydraulics and electrical connections. Designed to be simple, rigid and reliable, the ICE Side-Grip was developed following an extensive study on similar attachments, as well as input from operators who best understand their requirements. The result is a unique, linear side-clamping system that gives full control over the sheet pile.   Working in conjunction with the Side-Grip, the DX20 Excavator-Mounted Impact Hammer gives the operator full control of the hammer stroke and blow rate from inside the excavator, which allows precise matching of energy to suit the pile. The DX20 is fitted with a tilt/rotator and quick hitch adapter for optimum manoeuvrability. When connected to the excavator’s quick hitch, the hammer can be quickly lifted from a horizontal transport position to a vertical position. Side tilt adjustment of 5 degrees left and right allows it to cope with the cant of site conditions, and during piling, the hammer is automatically guided or crowded in the vertical plane. The hammer is delivered to site with a drive plate and anvil suitable for driving sheet piles and tubes up to 550mm, for 610mm diameter tubes (rail stanchions).

30 December 2022,Doosan DL380-7 in ceramic floor tile industry,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,doosan-dl3807-in-ceramic-floor-tile-industry_5705.htm","Trans-Tomaco is a family company based in Castellón in Spain, founded in 1950 by professionals from the world of transport, logistics management and earthmoving. Since then, the business has fulfilled all of its clients' material transport needs. Its vehicle fleet is three years old on average and is diversified in order to meet the demand of operators with modern and state-of-the-art equipment. The latest addition to the fleet at Trans-Tomaco is the purchase of a new Doosan DL380-7 wheel loader to move raw materials used in the manufacture of porcelain stoneware flooring in the Castellón area. The ceramic sector in Spain is of vital importance at a national level, but above all in terms of exports. Spain is the benchmark in the industry and one of the main European and world exporting countries in this market, with 90% of production being concentrated in the province of Castellón. Raw materials for the industry arrive at the ports of Castellón and Valencia, or come from mines in various Spanish towns, and are transported by truck to the ceramics plant. Using the new Doosan DL380-7 loader, these materials are collected and fed into hoppers, so that the ceramic atomizer has a continuous supply for the manufacture of tiles. The dependability of the wheel loader is paramount, because production cannot be stopped once the ovens are switched on, as the process is continuous. “We need to stack a large amount of material, mainly white clay, to feed the hoppers quickly and reliably. We are talking about a movement of at least three thousand tonne of material per day, in two shifts,” commented Raúl Martínez Paula, the machine operator in charge. “The Doosan DL380-7 wheel loader provides us with a large loading capacity and it is faster and guarantees a better performance with lower fuel consumption. We now have a 4.3m<sup>3</sup> shovel that improves the effectiveness of the work considerably. With this greater load capacity we have made gains in efficiency.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""600"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/dooswl1.jpg"" width=""800""/> The DL380-7 is part of the new generation DL-7 wheel loader family, which offers maximum capacities from 2.8 to 6.4m<sup>3</sup>. In addition, the Z-bar lift arm provides high breakout forces and lifting capacities, especially for heavier materials, and a large dumping angle to efficiently unload materials. “We highly value the speed of movement, the power and the low fuel consumption - everything goes well together. This machine is very easy to operate, manoeuvres perfectly both indoors and outdoors, and performs and runs very well,” added Raúl Martínez Paula. The Doosan DL380-7 wheel loader features a Stage 5 engine that primarily uses Selective Catalytic Reduction, plus a longer lasting Diesel Particulate Filter, with a fully automatic regeneration process designed to manage itself, without operator intervention. Eliminating exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) from the engine leads to much lower fuel consumption and fewer particulates in the exhaust. With no EGR needed and a new selection of power modes available - SAT2, Standard or Power - the new generation Situation Awareness Technology (SAT2) power management system automatically scans the machine’s activity and adjusts the engine’s output according to real time analysis of the boom pressure, pump pressure and output shaft. Raúl Martínez Paula explained, “Previously, we owned another Doosan loader, a DL300 and we were satisfied with its performance so we weren't considering changing brands. Compared with the old machine, the new loader is more modern, sleeker and very comfortable. It is larger, the cab is very spacious, comfortable and has a better finish. It has an 8-inch touchscreen that is easy to read and use, with all the functions integrated in one place. Visibility from the operator's station is unbeatable.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""537"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/dooswl3.jpg"" width=""800""/> Inside the cab, the DL380-7 wheel loader offers enhanced operating comfort, an enhanced steering system and advanced electronic controls. Using the new Doosan Smart Key system on the control panel in the cab, the operator can start the machine using a keyless device, helping to prevent machine theft. The Smart Key system provides remote door control, door lock and unlock, door release, searching and other functions. The control panel also includes two USB sockets. The new cab has a Grammer Actimo XXL seat with fully adjustable horizontal and vertical suspension settings, a pneumatic lumbar function and seat heating as standard. The new EMCV (Electric Main Control Valve) joystick fully integrated in the armrest is another standard feature in the cab, providing the operator with smoother and precise controllability of the lift arm and attachments on the wheel loader. Raúl Martínez Paula continued, ""It is also worth noting the breakout force of this loader, as well as its high traction that facilitates the penetration of even the hardest materials. This is a very safe and robust machine and we also opted for the DL380-7 because of the confidence provided by the service of the Doosan distributor, Sumag Mop, and the professionals in their workshop, together with that offered by Centrocar, exclusive importer of Doosan in Spain, Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, who we have been working with for many years.” "
29 December 2022,JCB electric mini celebrates milestone,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,jcb-electric-mini-celebrates-milestone_5704.htm","JCB’s double-award winning electric mini excavator recently marked another significant milestone in its short history – the production of the 1,000th machine. JCB went into full production with the world’s first volume-produced all-electric mini excavator in 2019. Employees at JCB Compact Products in Cheadle, Staffordshire, gathered on the shop floor to cheer the milestone 1,000th 19C-E model off the production line. JCB Chairman Lord Bamford said, “We are delighted with the success of JCB’s electric mini excavator, which is proving very popular around the world, particularly in North America, France and the UK where there is a growing demand for zero emissions equipment operating in urban environments.” JCB has been at the forefront of the development of electric technology to meet customers’ demands for zero-emission products and the company has led the way with the introduction of a battery-electric solution for smaller machines. The 19C-1E is said to be five times quieter than its diesel counterpart and can be fully charged in under two hours and can complete a typical full shift on a single charge. The model has reportedly been a big hit with companies working inside buildings and in emissions and noise-sensitive inner-city areas. It is said to be ideal for working indoors or outdoors, in factories, tunnels or basements, for digging foundations, or on utility projects. In 2019, the 19C-1E scooped one of the automotive industry’s most prestigious honours when the Royal Automobile Club presented JCB with the Dewar Trophy for ‘Outstanding Technical Achievement in the British Automotive Industry’ for the development of the machine. The following year, the Royal Academy of Engineering in the UK announced that the 19C-1E had won the MacRobert Award, a prize for innovation that has been presented since 1969 to honour a wide variety of engineering feats, including the CT scanner and Rolls-Royce’s Pegasus engine used in the Harrier jump jet.

28 December 2022,Bobcat telehandlers at Colours of Ostrava music fe...,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,bobcat-telehandlers-at-colours-of-ostrava-music-festival_5702.htm","For many years, Bobcat telehandlers have been gaining popularity in fields such as construction, agriculture, waste management and elsewhere. For many companies, they are invaluable tools when handling materials. This was ably demonstrated in the key role they played in the preparation of one of the biggest music festivals in the Czech Republic – the legendary Colours of Ostrava. Five Bobcat telehandlers from the largest T40.180SLP and T36.120SL models to the smaller TL38.70HF and two TL35.70HF machines helped ‘on the set’ during the build-up to the festival. A Bobcat S590 skid-steer loader also assisted in smaller tasks on the ground. An integral part of the work of telehandlers involved the use of specialised attachments such as a work platform. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""594"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/Bobcat Colours of Ostrava (1).jpeg"" width=""800""/> As part of the often hectic preparations for the festival, Bobcat machines were used by a number of different staff, who had high praise for the machines. The staff often have the opportunity to try something new – in this case they provided valuable feedback back to the company's headquarters (Doosan Bobcat EMEA is based in Dobříš in central Bohemia, where it has a production plant, an innovation centre for development, the headquarters for the EMEA region and where training for customers also takes place). The telehandlers handled a number of tasks, including the transportation of equipment for bands, installation of lights and decorations, general handling of materials during construction, and transportation of concrete blocks for use as part of temporary structures. The S590 loader was primarily used for landscaping around the site. "
27 December 2022,Hyundai HX220AL for Kastle Crushers,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,hyundai-hx220al-for-kastle-crushers_5703.htm","Crushing. Digging. Munching. Pecking. Feeding. Screening. Independent crushing and screening contractors, Kastle Crushers needed a machine that could do it all. With a brief to find something powerful and long-lasting with a lower emission output, Kastle Crushers turned to its trusted dealer Taylor and Braithwaite to find them one crawler excavator that could do everything that they need. The machine that perfectly fit that bill was the Hyundai 22-tonne HX220AL. Kastle Crushers has specialised in the crushing, screening and recycling of aggregates for over 25 years from its recycling site near Selby. The size of projects and sites that it provides machines for varies hugely, and so any vehicle that the company purchases needs to be a good all-rounder, able to be used in tight spaces but reliably deliver on power and performance. Sam Collis, Director of Kastle Crushers said, “We were looking for an excavator that could do a bit of everything, would be durable and capable of accepting a whole host of additional attachments including munchers, peckers and buckets. Hyundai has certainly lived up to its good reputation and our operators are impressed with how the HX220AL is handling. Not only that, but the Stage 5 Cummins engine is helping us to lower our emissions without compromising on power – a huge benefit as we look to future-proof our fleet and move towards a more eco-conscious business model.” It was important to Kastle Crushers to choose a machine that would keep their operators happy and John Holtby, one such operator, has nothing but positive feedback for the HX220AL. John said, “The new Hyundai has everything you hope for as a driver – the air con is great, the seat is perfect and it’s really responsive. But what makes the biggest difference to the operator are the safety features. The glass panel on the door is a brilliant addition – when you’re high up on the pile you can see down the sides and it makes you feel more confident because you have a better view of what’s around you. The 360-degree camera is a godsend too, particularly when you’ve got pedestrians wandering on site. Safety is paramount on any job and in the Hyundai you definitely feel like that’s taken care of.” Supplied by Hyundai Construction Equipment dealer, Taylor and Braithwaite, the HX220A crawler excavator is part of Hyundai’s flagship A-Series – a 22,100kg machine that is powered by a Stage 5-certified Cummins engine, featuring an integrated after-treatment system that reduces emissions and maintenance requirements while delivering exceptional power and fuel economy. The HX220AL features the new Engine Connected Diagnostics (ECD) system which immediately reports any engine failure to both Hi-MATE and the engine manufacturer to ensure the fastest, easiest resolution. On top of that, the new EPFC (Electronic Pump Flow Control) system improves controllability and reduces operating costs. "

22 December 2022,Schoolboy ADT driver,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,schoolboy-adt-driver_5707.htm","13-year-old Jay Currie has become one of the youngest trained articulated dump truck drivers in the UK, after gaining his Construction Plant Competence Scheme (CPCS) ADT (articulated dump truck) Red Card. The schoolboy from Cullen follows in his brother Jamie’s footsteps (pictured below), who became <a href=""https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,13year-old-jamie-currie-becomes-trained-operator_4351.htm"" target=""_blank"">the youngest trained operator</a> in the UK after gaining a CPCS Red Card in 2020, when he was also aged just 13. “I have always been fascinated with big dump trucks since a young age,” explained Jay. “My brother did his digger ticket so I thought I should try to get a dumper ticket so we can get some earthmoving done. I wanted to do it at an early age too so that I could have more experience on the machine.” Jay took his first step towards the qualification aged 12, when he was eligible to take the CITB Health, Safety & Environment (HS&E) test. “I couldn’t book my first test until I was 12 so we booked it on my 12th birthday, and I passed 10 days later with 49/50 marks.” After passing the HS&E test, Jay was determined to add to his qualifications. He continued practicing and building up experience on the machines before, in November 2022, he attended a three-day course followed by a test at GoldCast Academy in Lanark. “During the course, I had to drive the dump truck around a stockpile into position for loading, then do the same in reverse,” Jay continued. “I found it quite easy, and it also helped that the Bell B20 dump truck was easy to use. I revised the theory questions and what they meant too, so I passed with flying colours 151/151 marks and I then passed the practical test too. In the test, we were loaded by a digger and reversed to the stop block and tipped the load. I completed around 10 loads.” <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""533"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/Jay Currie with big brother Jamie Cu.jpg"" width=""800""/> Jay and Jamie’s passion for diggers runs in the family, with his dad, James Currie, being the director of Currie Contractors Cullen Ltd. Commenting on his brother’s achievement, Jamie Currie said, “It’s really good that Jay has his dump truck qualification now. It means we can practice together and do jobs around the house. When we’re old enough to work on commercial sites, I hope we can do that together and build our own plant business one day.” Both Jamie and Jay have been encouraged throughout their very first steps in the plant industry by the President of the Scottish Plant Owners Association (SPOA), Callum Mackintosh. Callum said, “What a fantastic achievement by Jay and what a duo him and his brother are! Laying the foundations for a career in plant at 13 is admirable, the focus, hard work and determination shown here will carry Jay a long way in life. “Jay and his older brother are an inspiration for other young people, particularly those whose family business is in the plant industry and can replicate their achievements,” Callum continued. “Careers in plant are well worth considering and I look forward to seeing where Jay’s future takes him.” When asked about his next plans, Jay said, “I hope to gain some more experience when I can, maybe even on a bigger dump truck like the 777 I saw at Finning the day before my test, and pass my NVQ when I am 16. I would like to encourage other people like me to follow in my footsteps or similar as it can provide a great career path and it can make their CV look better when applying for a job. They will have lots more experience despite still being a young age, rather than being completely new to a machine.” "

19 December 2022,New Case E-Series wheeled excavators,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,new-case-eseries-wheeled-excavators_5695.htm","Case has revealed a four-model E-Series wheeled excavator range, with a fifth, larger model joining the series in the future. The machines will be built under an existing supply agreement with South Korean manufacturer Hyundai Construction Equipment. The Case wheeled excavator line-up will include the conventional tail swing WX140E and WX160E, along with the short radius WX155E SR and the WX175E SR. These four models will be joined by a conventional tail swing WX210E at a later stage. The new Case E-Series wheeled excavators will be available in a range of lower frame layouts, with several combinations of front and rear dozer blades plus front and rear outriggers. Upper equipment will comprise a choice of mono or two-piece main booms for all machines except the WX175E SR, which will be supplied with a two-piece articulating boom only. Standard cruise control will make travel between work sites easier while moving material in a work site is made more efficient by the optional ride control and even more so by using joystick steering controls.Proven technology The new Case wheeled excavators are powered by EU Stage 5-compliant Cummins diesel engines. The four smaller models will use a Cummins B4.5 engine, delivering an above industry standard, outstanding maximum power of 129kW, while the WX210E will come with the larger B6.7, offering up to 145kW maximum power. The engines feature an exhaust aftertreatment module incorporating a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and a diesel particulate filter (DPF). With no need for complex exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system to comply with Stage 5 requirements, the maintenance cost is much reduced. In addition, fuel filter service intervals are 1,000 hours and engine oil and filter intervals are set at 800 hours, further maximizing machine up time for the operator. The engines are capable of operating with a range of fuels to suit the customer. This includes B7 and B20 biodiesel, hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO) and gas-to-liquid (GTL), coal-to-liquids (CTL) biomass-to-liquid (BTL) paraffinic fuels. The WX140E through to the WX175E SR all use a Load Independent Flow Sharing hydraulic system from Bosch Rexroth. This delivers smooth, progressive control for the operator, while enhancing multi-function operation of boom, dipper arm and bucket functions. A pressure compensator is built into the control system, to allow flow sharing performance for simultaneous travel and boom operations. The larger WX210E will come with an open centre hydraulic system with Electric Positive Flow Control, from Kawasaki. This uses a twin-pump layout, offering the power distribution required for smooth, productive operation. An electro-hydraulic proportional pressure reducing valve helps to reduce fuel consumption and boost performance. Operators can also benefit from an optional automatic digging brake and a fine swing control, to further ease control of the machine’s movements.

The windscreen has parallel wipers in both the upper and lower sections for the widest possible coverage and the machines can be supplied with an optional rear-view camera on the right-hand side. The Case 360-degree Maximum View Monitor is also offered as an option, along with rear-mounted radar for maximum visibility and safety. The Case Maximum View Monitor uses four cameras, mounted around the machine, to provide a 360-degree aerial view. This provides the operator with a complete view of the machine on the worksite, increasing safety and visibility and preventing potential collisions. The optional radar alarm can be set to five distances from the machine, warning the operator of any possible collision to the rear or the sides of the excavator. Six LED work lights are standard, further improving visibility in poor light conditions. An 8-inch touchscreen monitor provides access to a menu system that controls all functions of the machine. A secondary screen is available for cameras. The operator can navigate the main screen through a jog dial controller, that also controls the engine throttle. This jog dial has 10 engine rpm positions. The monitor provides ECO guidance for the operator, showing a range of data including idle times to help the driver to improve their performance and productivity while working. Proportional joystick controls are standard, with a forward/reverse selection switch in the lever head. The lever also contains a front axle oscillation lock and a detent feature. Joystick steering is optional, as is a smart key with push-button start. The operator can select within the monitor menus up to 10 pre-set auxiliary hydraulic flow and pressure settings. This makes it easier to inter-change hydraulic attachments, with hydraulic flows suited to each work tool. The right-hand joystick also has a switch to activate one-way or two-way auxiliary flow. Key specs for each machine are as follows: Case WX140E (129kW) – 14,900 to 15,860kg operating weight, mono- or 2-piece boom, 2.6m wheelbase; Case WX155E SR (129kW) – 16,860 to 17,170kg operating weight, mono- or 2-piece boom, 2.6m wheelbase; Case WX160E (129kW) – 17,580 to 18,390kg operating weight, mono- or 2-piece boom, 2.6m wheelbase; Case WX175E SR (129kW) – 18,820kg operating weight, 2-piece boom, 2.6m wheelbase; and Case WX210E (145kW) – 21,280 to 22,510kg operating weight, mono- or 2-piece boom, 2.85m wheelbase.

09 December 2022,SMT GB's first Volvo EWR130E excavator,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,smt-gbs-first-volvo-ewr130e-excavator_5681.htm","With its compact footprint, articulated boom, and the shortest front and rear swing radius on the market, Great Britain’s first Volvo EWR130E wheeled excavator from SMT GB is said to be ideal for Flannery’s urban infrastructure projects, such as the HS2 Victoria Road Crossover Box. Flannery Plant Hire has taken delivery of Great Britain’s first Volvo EWR130E wheeled excavator from SMT GB, putting it straight to work at the HS2 Victoria Road Crossover Box site in West London. On this project, Flannery is supporting its customer SCS Railways – a joint venture between contractors Skanska, Costain, and Strabag – to construct the huge underground box structure that will hold the crossover track mechanism for trains to switch between tracks as they travel in and out of the HS2 Old Oak Common station. The Volvo EWR130E is currently excavating foundations for a large conveyor that will carry material from the crossover box excavation site all the way to Willesden Euro Terminal where it will be transported away by rail, reducing both road traffic and emissions from the site. Despite the vast size of the project, conditions are tight, and Flannery needed an excavator that could easily manoeuvre around the site and dig in confined spaces. The Volvo EWR130E wheeled excavator is able to take on jobs that a conventional excavator cannot, thanks to its new boom and arm design, which possess the shortest front (1.81m) and rear (1.55m) swing radius on the market. The footprint is also kept small by the inline outriggers which, along with the divided blades, help the operator to position and stabilise the excavator within a wide variety of locations. When Flannery needs to move the EWR130E between jobsites in the future, the low machine height and optimised tie-down points on the lower frame will reportedly make it easy to transport. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""508"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/VolvoEWR130E_2.jpg"" width=""800""/> After a few weeks at the controls, Flannery Operator Alex Moraru (pictured below) is already a fan. “I would drive it home if I could. It’s a really good machine to drive all day,” he said. “The seat is really comfortable, the buttons are easy to reach and the shortcuts are really useful. I also like the Volvo Smart View, where the cameras show a 360-degree view of the machine. This is a great safety feature when you are working in tight spaces, and where you have other people around you on site.” Alex also praised the machine’s ease of maintenance and low fuel consumption. “It’s very easy to maintain. The greasing points are easily accessible and gathered together in two places only, which you don’t often see on competitor models. A good thing as well would be the fuel consumption, which is really low. I wouldn’t expect it to be so low for the size of the machine.” "

The Construction Equipment Association (CEA), owners of the Cesar Scheme, developed ECV as a response to the demand for an easy and reliable way to confirm the emissions category of construction equipment used within Low Emission Zones and ‘green’ construction sites. Cesar ECV has already been recognised by HS2 as an acceptable means of demonstrating a machine's green credentials and other major schemes are also looking favourably at the initiative. Andrea Davidson, Air Quality Lead, Phase One, HS2 Ltd said, “We are happy to confirm that we would accept the ECV as part of the registration process for plant to work on HS2 sites, and would consider it suitable for compliance assurance purposes.” Suneeta Johal, Chief Executive of the CEA commented, “With the expansion of Low Emission Zones and ‘green’ construction sites, there is an urgent demand for the quick identification of the certified emission levels of machines brought on to sites. The easy-to-read and scan visual sticker cuts out a lot of work for construction site managers and local authorities, and as such, the ECV application for Cesar is the single biggest development since the scheme was launched as an anti-theft initiative back in 2007.” "
02 December 2022,Topcon donates to TU Dublin,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,topcon-donates-to-tu-dublin_5668.htm","Topcon Positioning Systems has committed to making two significant donations to TU Dublin, Ireland’s first technological university, which will enhance students’ experience with education on the latest digital construction methods. The announcement marks another step in the long-standing relationship between the two organisations. As a designer, manufacturer and distributor of precision measurement and workflow solutions, Topcon has an opportunity to support the university with an initial equipment donation worth €1.5 million (around £1.3m) in market value, which will be continually updated with the latest technology available. This approach is part of what Topcon terms its ‘Learn-Apply-Build’ (LAB) initiative, helping universities keep pace with the rapid changes in advanced technologies for hands-on training, equipping students with knowledge of the most current construction and geopositioning tools as they enter the workforce. <img alt="""" class=""inline-image"" height=""527"" src=""/ugc-1/1/6/0/TU_Dublin_Topcon_visit_36_edit.jpg"" width=""800""/> Additionally, Topcon has committed to be a TU Dublin Cornerstone Donor, providing a philanthropic donation of €500,000 (£430,000) over a period of five years. This funding will support the development of a new Design + Construct Centre at TU Dublin’s Broombridge site in Cabra, which will be a National Centre of Excellence for construction, engineering, and architectural education, and expand the university’s footprint in the Dublin 7 area. The donation also includes two fully funded, four-year scholarships to the university, and the relationship will see students given the opportunity to take part in internships across the globe in Topcon locations. Current estimations predict that the Irish construction sector will employ only 78,000 workers by 2025, but with the Irish government’s ambitious National Development Plan requiring 180,000 construction workers, a boost to the sector’s workforce is imperative. Topcon’s partnership with TU Dublin aims to address not only Ireland’s skills gap, but also strengthen the pipeline of highly skilled workers entering the sector across Europe. "

01 December 2022,Five Doosans heading to Ukraine,"https://www.earthmoversmagazine.co.uk/news/view,five-doosans-heading-to-ukraine_5669.htm","Five Doosan DX17Z mini-excavators are part of a package of equipment being sent by South Korea to support Ukraine. The mini-excavators and 20 generators from the Korean government are being supplied alongside contributions from aid agencies in France and the United States, together totalling almost 200 generators to help Ukraine after attacks on critical infrastructure in the country. The equipment is expected to be delivered this month on a chartered flight.   The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, reported on November 25th 2022 that South Korea would provide the equipment for Ukraine. “An agreement was reached with the Korean side on the transfer of 20 generators with a capacity of 450-500kW, as well as five Doosan DX17Z mini-excavators to Ukraine as humanitarian aid,” Ukraine’s Ambassador to South Korea, Dmytro Ponomarenko, said. France is ready to send 100 high-power generators to Ukraine. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Ukraine will provide 80 generators to help keep the power on. These announcements follow on from earlier this year when Doosan made a donation at the company’s European Dealer Meeting to support Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the international medical humanitarian organisation. Ukraine is crying out for help from the rest of the world and teams from MSF are working hard to deliver emergency medical aid to people in Ukraine, as well as those seeking safety in neighbouring countries.
