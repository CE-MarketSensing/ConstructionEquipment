(President and CEO: Hiroyuki Ogawa) , a global leader in construction and mining equipment, today announced a new collaboration to electrify next-generation underground mining machines using Proterra’s battery technology.\\n\\nUnder the collaboration, Proterra will supply its H Series battery system technology to Komatsu for the development of battery-electric LHDs, drills and bolters for underground hard rock mining. Mining equipment and services provider Komatsu plans to utilize Proterra’s high-performance battery systems for the development of prototype machines this year before the expected commencement of commercial production in 2022.\\nA Komatsu underground LHD is pictured with Proterra batteries.\\nThe collaboration represents Proterra’s entry into the underground mining equipment market.\\n“Proterra is excited to build on our relationship with a proven, industry-leader like Komatsu to electrify mining machines with our EV technology,” said Gareth Joyce, President of Proterra. “The benefits of zero-emissions, battery-electric vehicles extend far beyond our roads and cities. Switching to battery-electric technology means helping protect clean air for those working in underground mines while delivering a high-performance technology solution where safety and reliability are paramount.”\\n“INSERT PROTERRA QUOTE” President of Proterra – division\\n“We are excited to be working with Proterra to bring zero-emissions mining solutions to underground hard rock,” said Josh Wagner, vice president of hard rock mining at Komatsu. “Leveraging their battery technology, we seek to offer customers increasing sustainable solutions for their operations.” \\n\\nThis is the second collaboration between Proterra and Komatsu. The two companies previously announced an agreement in which Proterra supplies its industry-leading battery systems to support Komatsu in electrifying its first medium-sized hydraulic excavators.\\n\\nKomatsu has helped advance customer options to mitigate environmental impact through product development for many years, through initiatives such as its hybrid hydraulic excavators kickoff in 2008, which marked the world’s first hybrid construction equipment on the market. This year, Komatsu also announced its new Greenhouse Gas (GHG) alliance with customers to actively collaborate on product planning, development, testing and deployment of the next generation of zero-emission mining equipment and infrastructure. The alliance’s initial target is advancing Komatsu’s power-agnostic truck concept for a haulage vehicle that can run on a variety of power sources including diesel electric, electric, trolley (wired), battery power and even hydrogen fuel cells.\\n\\nDesigned and manufactured in the United States, Proterra battery systems leverage industry-leading energy density and a customizable design to fit within a variety of vehicles. Proterra’s best-in-class battery systems have been proven in more than 20 million service miles driven by Proterra transit vehicles and selected by world-class commercial vehicle manufacturers to power heavy-duty vehicles, including construction equipment.\\n\\nProterra battery systems offer an outstanding application for confined, underground mining settings where safety and durability are of utmost importance, while helping to mitigate air and noise pollution through battery-electric technology. Proterra uses rigorous testing to ensure Proterra battery packs are designed to withstand tough conditions and meet or exceed the latest functional safety standards. Proterra battery systems incorporate liquid thermal conditioning, monitoring sensors throughout the battery pack, as well as active and passive protective features like passive propagation resistance to isolate individual battery cells in the rare case of a thermal event. \\n\\nA Komatsu underground drill is pictured with Proterra batteries.\\n  No : 0057(3072)\\nCorporate Communications Department\\nSustainability Promotion Division\\nKomatsu Ltd.\\ntel: +81-(0)3-5561-2616\\nmail: JP00MB_cc_department@global.komatsu\\n\\n*The information may be subject to change without notice.'"

       " \"  Komatsu Ltd. today announced its consolidated business results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 (U.S. GAAP). The highlights are described below.In the following, “the Company” expresses Komatsu Ltd. on a non-consolidated basis, while “Komatsu”, on a consolidated basis.1. Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2023（FY2022）For the fiscal year under review (April 1, 2022 - March 31, 2023), the first year of the mid-term management plan, consolidated net sales totaled JPY 3,543.5 billion, up 26.4% from the previous fiscal year. In the construction, mining and utility equipment business, demand for mining equipment expanded, centering on North America and Asia. Komatsu worked to make its supply chain highly resilient to changes in the external environment, especially by capitalizing on cross-sourcing and strengthening multi-sourcing, and steadily capturing demand for new equipment. Sales increased from the previous fiscal year, affected by advanced parts sales and service revenues, improved selling prices in almost all regions of the world and the Japanese yen’s depreciation. In the industrial machinery and others business, while sales of large presses mainly declined among presses, sheet-metal machines and machine tools for the automobile manufacturing industry, sales made a steady gain in the Excimer laser-related business against the backdrop of expanding demand for semiconductors worldwide. As a result, sales of this business increased from the previous fiscal year.With respect to profits for the fiscal year under review, operating income surged by 54.8% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 490.7 billion, reflecting improved selling prices and the Japanese yen's depreciation, which more than offset the adverse effects of increased prices of materials and logistics costs. The operating income ratio improved by 2.5 percentage points to 13.8%. Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies expanded by 46.8% to JPY 476.4 billion. Net income attributable to Komatsu Ltd. climbed to JPY 326.4 billion, up 45.1%.2. Projections for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2024（FY2023）In the construction, mining and utility equipment business, Komatsu expects demand for mining equipment will remain strong, centering on Asia and North America, while demand for construction equipment will slow down, partly due to rising interest rates. Based mainly on its assumption of the Japanese yen’s appreciation, Komatsu anticipates a decline in sales. With respect to segment profit, Komatsu expects an increase by more than offsetting the impact of the Japanese yen’s appreciation, lower sales volume and higher fixed costs with improved selling prices.In the retail finance business, Komatsu anticipates a decrease in both sales and segment profit, mainly due to the impact of the Japanese yen’s appreciation and the absences of gains on reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts and those on resale of used equipment after the termination of leases, which were recorded for the fiscal year under review.In the industrial machinery and others business, Komatsu expects an increase in both sales and segment profit, as sales of the Excimer-laser related business for the semiconductor industry will remain steady and those of presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools for the automobile manufacturing industry will increase, centering on large presses.As a result, Komatsu expects a decrease in consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. Operating incomes is expected to flat from the fiscal year under review, mainly due to an improvement in selling prices. Komatsu anticipates a decrease in net income attributable to Komatsu Ltd., mainly due to an increase in interest expenses caused by higher interest rates.As preconditions for its projection, Komatsu is assuming the foreign exchange rates will be as follows: USD1=JPY 125.0, EUR1=JPY 133.0, and AUD1=JPY 83.0.  3. Cash DividendsConcerning cash dividends for the fiscal year under review, after considering consolidated business results for the fiscal year under review and future business prospects, the Company is planning to increase the year-end common stock dividend per share by JPY 11 from the earlier projection of JPY 64 per share.

       " ' Komatsu Ltd. (President and CEO: Hiroyuki Ogawa) and its wholly owned subsidiary Komatsu Europe International N.V. (hereafter “Komatsu”) are pleased to announce the company’s decision to switch to Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) as factory-fill fuel for Komatsu equipment produced in Europe.Filling a Komatsu machine with HVO as factory-fill fuel at the KGC plant in Hannover, Germany  In line with Komatsu’s long-term goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and as a challenging target in the mid-term management plan, this Komatsu world first will begin in April 2023 at the Komatsu Germany GmbH, Construction Division (KGC) plant in Hannover, Germany, and at the Komatsu UK plant in Birtley, England, with other Komatsu Europe plants to follow. The combustion engines in Komatsu machines*1 can be operated with HVO*2, with no modifications required. The switch to this renewable, paraffinic fuel as a sustainable alternative to traditional diesel fuel is a major step Komatsu is taking towards reducing its environmental impact. It shows that the company\\'s machines can run on a cleaner and more sustainable fuel, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improving air quality. HVO is produced from renewable raw material such as cooking oil and animal fats wastes. It is a simple drop-in replacement for fossil diesel, but with high cetane, no oxygen and no aromatics. It can lower the amount of greenhouse gas emitted by your Komatsu equipment by up to 90 percent, if the machine is fuelled with Neste MY Renewable Diesel (= HVO 100) from Neste, one of our main suppliers of HVO.\"HVO not only grants lower emissions during operation by superior chemical composition.\"  said Ingo Büscher, Managing Director of KGC. \"Komatsu’s HVO first fill product (Neste MY Renewable Diesel) is mainly made of waste material limiting consumption renewable resources such as vegetable oils.\" He added: \"We are committed to support our customers in achieving their long-term sustainability goals as a one team approach. We believe that HVO is an effective and economical option to both reduce emissions and save limited resources.\"Komatsu’s switch to HVO factory-fill fuel is just one of the many steps that the company is taking towards sustainability, along with the research and development of new technologies and solutions such as electric and hydrogen-powered machines, to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and achieve its zero-emission goal.By embracing solutions like HVO fuel, Komatsu is helping to create a more sustainable future for the construction and mining industries.DANTOTSU Value is defined as customer value creation that generates a positive cycle of improvement of earnings and ESG resolutions in Komatsu\\'s mid-term management plan, entitled \"DANTOTSU Value - Together, to ‘The Next’ for sustainable growth\". Through this DANTOTSU Value, Komatsu will strive to create new values in order to take steady steps forward to the next stage for the workplace of the future and pass on a sustainable future to the next generation.*1 including the construction, forklift, mining and forestry machines *2 Only HVOs that conform to the standards can be used for Komatsu machines equipped with Komatsu engines.Note: The GHG emission reduction varies depending on the region-specific legislation that provides the methodology for the calculations (e.g. EU RED II 2018/2001/EU for Europe and US California LCFS for the US), and the raw material mix used to manufacture the product for each market.About NesteNeste (NESTE, Nasdaq Helsinki) creates solutions for combating climate change and accelerating a shift to a circular economy. We refine waste, residues and innovative raw materials into renewable fuels and sustainable feedstock for plastics and other materials. We are the world’s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel and developing chemical recycling to combat the plastic waste challenge. We aim at helping customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions with our renewable and circular solutions by at least 20 million tons annually by 2030. Our ambition is to make the Porvoo oil refinery in Finland the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030.

Komatsu and EARTHBRAIN are going to help customers improve the safety and productivity of their workplaces.  The need for remote control of construction equipment is increasing year by year as the labor shortage and aging of operators at construction sites in Japan become more serious. To achieve safe, highly productive, smart and clean workplaces of the future, Komatsu has been developing remote control systems over the years. In 2020 Komatsu was the first company in Japan that successfully conducted a verification test of remote control of construction and mining equipment using 5G.To ensure steady commercial production from the previously verification concept, Komatsu developed the system based on its radio-controlled vehicles, which have a proven track record, such as in the restoration work of Mount Unzen Fugendake in the 1990s. By combining newly developed software and controller that convert remote control signals for radio-controlled operation and transmit them, we aim to commercialize this system as a remote control system of high quality and reliability.The remote control cockpit developed by EARTHBRAIN enables remote control with a sense of presence, just as in the actual driver\\'s seat, while checking the front, back, left, right, and work equipment through high-definition video sent from the construction equipment. The transmission and reception of the on-site images and control signals necessary for remote control are sent via 5G mobile network, which features high speed, large capacity, and low latency, in cooperation with NTT Communications Corporation. 5G and cloud-based service (\"docomo MEC™ \"※1 , \"MEC direct™ \"※2 ) are used to connect construction sites and remote control bases.With the cooperation of OONO DEVELOPMENT CO., LTD. (Chairman: Teruaki Oono, Headquarters: Matsuyama City, Ehime Prefecture), which has already introduced this system, we are conducting final verification of technologies and safety for mass production and plan to flexibly respond to the different remote control needs of each customer and each site.This system can also be linked with Smart Construction Fleet and Smart Construction Retrofit, and when linked with these services, we can expect to maximize work efficiency in loading dump trucks and further improve safety in construction equipment operation.  Komatsu and EARTHBRAIN will work to create new value at future workplaces, as we improve the functions of the system for on-site use and further upgrade the system toward the commercial production by the end of this fiscal year.1 \"docomo MEC\" is DOCOMO\\'s cloud service with features of MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) required in the 5G era, such as low latency and high security.2 \"MEC direct\" is a service that achieves low-latency and high-security communications through 5G by optimizing communication route by directly connecting terminals and cloud infrastructure provided by DOCOMO.* \"docomo MEC\" and \"MEC direct\" are trademarks of NTT DOCOMO, INC.

       " '  Komatsu Ltd. (hereafter “Komatsu”) (Hiroyuki Ogawa, President and CEO) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (hereafter “Honda”) (Toshihiro Mibe, Director, President and Representative Executive Officer) have jointly developed the PC05E-1, an expanded model of the PC01E-1 electric micro excavator, with the aim of early introduction to Japanese market in FY2023. Honda is going to exhibit a sample prototype of this machine at the 13th INTERNATIONAL SMART GRID EXPO (scheduled to be held in Tokyo from March 15 to 17, 2023).  【PC05E-1 electric micro excavator】This machine is an expanded model of the electric micro excavator PC01E-1, which was launched on the Japanese market in March 2022. Like the PC01E-1, the PC05E-1 is powered by the Honda Mobile Power Pack e: (Mobile Power Pack e*1, hereafter “swappable mobile battery“) and Honda eGX electrified power unit as a power source. The PC05 is the base machine for the electric micro excavator and used for small-scale civil engineering and construction work among Komatsu’s construction equipment, including gas, electrical, and pipe-laying work.The PC05E-1 achieves a dramatic reduction of noise and heat emission, which are the features of electric micro excavators. The zero exhaust emission is also environmentally friendly, making it possible to work comfortably in any environment, either indoors or outdoors. As the batteries are swappable, customers can continue work simply by exchanging them, when one runs low, without waiting for the battery to recharge. In addition, the midship layout, with the battery located in the center of the vehicle under the operator seat, offers both stability and compactness equivalent to its engine-powered counterpart. Furthermore, the adoption of an electric motor that can exert power in the full RPM range enables powerful excavation even when working at low RPMs, which are challenging for engine-powered models. With respect to maintenance, since the engine is not mounted, customers will no longer need to clean air cleaners and filters, check engine oil, or refuel, significantly reducing time-consuming daily inspection and maintenance work for them.Komatsu is working on the development and market introduction of different electric models, including the development of the \"PC05E-1\" electric micro excavator. Komatsu positions FY2023 as the first year of launching electric construction equipment on the market.

With an input range from 400-1140V and an output of 300-900V, it features a universal CCS (AC/DC) charge plug and it too is transportable.Developed in partnership with Proterra, the Proterra portable charging concept is designed for use in “off grid” locations or where site power is inaccessible or unreliable. The Komatsu energy container concept for mini-excavator, exhibited as a charging solution concept for environments without a power supply, is compactly designed for easy transportation. In addition to charging mini-excavators, it can also be used to charge other electric equipment on the work site.  (Komatsu\\'s portable charging concept for mini-excavator)  HB365LC-3 hybrid excavatorKomatsu’s hybrid excavator is designed to provide high production and efficiency with low fuel consumption. Engineered for productivity with a Komatsu hybrid system that can provide an additional 70 Hp on demand, the HB365LC-3 allows operators to be up to 15% more productive in power mode, while its environmentally friendly operation offers up to 20% more fuel efficiency and 20% less CO2 emissions when compared to the PC360LC-11. Development of these hybrid and electric machines and charging stations moves Komatsu closer to its global sustainability target of a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 and complete carbon neutrality by 2050.MVT-II 600To reduce waste in the quarry and cement production process, the newly rebranded Komatsu MVT-II-600 crusher uses tension — rather than compression — which can save significant energy, in some cases up to 90%. The crushing process of the MVT-II 600 uses matched velocity technology (MVT) to generate far less fines in product, to help minimize waste production and disposal costs. Engineered for lower cost of ownership, the MVT-II 600 has replaceable bolt-on roll wear segments and durable pick technology and can consistently crush a combination of hard abrasive minerals and wet sticky material.With the right products, latest technologies, actionable data and dealer support, Komatsu and its customers can create value together.

       " 'Komatsu Ltd. (President and CEO: Hiroyuki Ogawa) (hereinafter \"Komatsu\") has been awarded a position on this year’s A List for climate change and water security by CDP*, the non-profit global environmental disclosure platform.The A-List is awarded to companies which are recognized as international leaders of managing climate change and water security.Every year, thousands of companies disclose data about their environmental impacts, risks and opportunities to CDP for independent assessment against its scoring methodology. In 2022, over 680 investors with over US$130 trillion in assets and 280 major purchasers with US$6.4 trillion in procurement spend requested companies to disclose data on environmental impacts, risks and opportunities through CDP’s platform and a record-breaking 18,700 companies responded. A detailed and independent methodology is used by CDP to assess these companies, allocating a score of A to D- based on the comprehensiveness of disclosure, awareness and management of environmental risks and demonstration of best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets.Komatsu has conventionally positioned environmental activities as one of top management priorities. In 2021, Komatsu upheld the new long-term vision of achieving carbon neutrality, virtually zero carbon emissions, by 2050. In the mid-term management plan “DANTOTSU Value – Together, to ‘The Next’ for sustainable growth”, which began in April 2022, Komatsu has also defined carbon neutral by 2050 as a challenging target and implemented aggressive activities. In order to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in the entire lifecycle of construction and mining equipment, Komatsu aims to introduce electrification equipment and is advancing to develop \"power agnostic concept truck\" that can run on a variety of power sources including fuel cells and hydrogen engines. By enabling efficient operation through automatic operation and remote control using sophisticated digital technologies, Komatsu is also determined to drive its activities to realize a low-carbon society as an industrial leader.Through climate change risk and opportunity assessments and scenario analyses based on TCFD, Komatsu will pursue increasing our resilience against climate change impacts. At the same time, Komatsu will advance climate change and water security response measures through a healthy dialogue with stakeholders.- Dexter Galvin, Global Director of Corporations and Supply Chains at CDP, said: “Congratulations to all the companies on this year’s A List; environmental transparency is the first vital step towards a net-zero and nature-positive future. In a year of ever-increasing environmental concerns around the world – from extreme weather to unprecedented losses to nature – the need for transformational, urgent and collaborative change is more critical than ever. We must decarbonize half of global GHG emissions and eliminate deforestation by 2030, alongside achieving water security on the same timescale – there is no route to 1.5°C without nature. As CDP continues to raise the bar on what qualifies as climate, forests and water leadership, we hope to see the ambitions and actions of companies on the A List – and those wanting a place on it – do the same.”*CDP: CDP is a global non-profit that runs the world’s environmental disclosure system for companies, cities, states and regions. Founded in 2000 and working with more than 680 financial institutions with over $130 trillion in assets, CDP pioneered using capital markets and corporate procurement to motivate companies to disclose their environmental impacts, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, safeguard water resources and protect forests. Nearly 20,000 organizations around the world disclosed data through CDP in 2022, including more than 18,700 companies worth half of global market capitalization, and over 1,100 cities, states and regions.

       " 'Komatsu Ltd. (President and CEO: Hiroyuki Ogawa) (hereafter “Komatsu”), jointly with Ishikawa Agriculture and Forestry Research Center and ASAHI AGRIA CO., LTD. (President: Masanori Murakami) (hereafter “ASAHI AGRIA”), a manufacturer of fertilizers, has successfully converted wood ash from the biomass boilers in operation at Komatsu’s Awazu Plant in an effort to promote efficient use of forest resources in the Kaga area of Ishikawa Prefecture, and to reduce industrial waste. As a leading model of the public-private sector partnership, the three partners will contribute to the reduction of industrial waste and achievement of carbon neutrality by developing the circulation cycle which extends to agriculture and forestry and the vitalization of agriculture and forestry in Ishikawa Prefecture by using biomass combustion ash as fertilizer.     【Left: Biomass combustion ash. Right: Delivery of biomass combustion ash from the Awazu Plant】  \\u3000In 2014, Komatsu reached a comprehensive forestry agreement with the Ishikawa prefectural government and the Federation of Forestry Associations of Ishikawa Prefecture to jointly promote the vitalization of local forestry. At its Awazu Plant, since 2015, Komatsu has operated biomass boilers using woodchips as fuel, mainly made of unused left-over wood after forest thinning in the Kaga area, which has facilitated energy savings, energy creation, and environmental impact reduction. Using about 6,000 tons of woodchips annually, Komatsu contributes to promoting sound management of forests and curbing driftwood-caused damages after heavy rain. Meanwhile, Komatsu has disposed of about 20 tons of wood ash generated in the biomass boilers as industrial waste, which has been an issue of concern for the Awazu Plant.After focusing attention on potassium and phosphorus, necessary nutrients of agricultural products contained in regular wood ash, at the Awazu Plant, since June 2016, Komatsu has worked with two new partners: the Ishikawa Agriculture and Forestry Research Center and ASAHI AGRIA. Work has centered on content analysis of wood ash generated in the biomass boilers at the Plant and on the verification of fertilizing effects with an eye to converting wood ash to fertilizer. These efforts have found a sufficient amount of active ingredients of fertilizer, including potassium. Cultivation tests have also demonstrated no difference from conventional fertilizers. In August 2017, Komatsu applied for “applications for registration of fertilizer” as biomass combustion ash-based fertilizer with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Japan has relied on imports of potassium and phosphorus as raw fertilizer materials. Recently, however, safe wood ash, generated mainly in biomass boilers, has attracted keen attention as an alternative raw material accessible in Japan. Against this background, the Japanese government enforced the revised Act on the Quality Control of Fertilizer in the previous fiscal year, which promoted the classification reassessment of fertilizers. Safety-verified wood ash is now classified as a “by-product fertilizer”. Awazu Plant’s biomass combustion ash was registered as by-product fertilizer in April 2022.     In April 2022, Komatsu began delivery of Awazu Plant’s biomass combustion ash as raw fertilizer material to ASAHI AGRIA’s Kansai Plant. Komatsu plans to deliver almost all of Awazu Plant’s ash there. Currently, the partner’s plant is busy preparing for the production start-up of fertilizer which uses biomass combustion ash. ASAHI AGRIA is working on launching sales of the fertilizer through the JA Group, the group of Japan agricultural cooperatives, and other sales channels, starting in FY2023. ASAHI AGRIA hopes to contribute to a stable supply of fertilizers for farmers in Ishikawa Prefecture as well as other prefectures. KAGA FOREST ASSOCIATION, which produces wood chips, has also been concerned about disposing of about 2,700 tons of tree roots and barks annually, which are generated during the process of felling and gathering, and are not suitable as a fuel for biomass boilers at the Awazu Plant. In an effort to reduce industrial waste of forest resource recycling in the Kaga area, the ASSOCIATION has worked to make tree roots and barks usable as fuel at large-scale biomass combustion facilities by mixing and crushing them together. Today, the Association engages in mixed crushing by using a large mobile crusher, and supplies crushed chips as fuel to large-scale biomass combustion facilities in Gifu Prefecture and other regions. As a result, it has become possible to completely use wood produced either from trunks or bark of forest and mountain trees, including the use as lumber, plywood, biomass wood chips, and the like.When all these series of efforts become widespread, they will hold the promise of not only carbon-neutral energy use of local wood in Ishikawa Prefecture, but also further vitalization of local agriculture and forestry, reduction of industrial waste volume in production, and recycling of generated industrial waste.     【Left: Prototype fertilizer made from biomass combustion ash. Right: Mixed crushing at KAGA FOREST ASSOCIATION】  \\u3000In the current mid-term management plan, Komatsu is committed to minimizing environmental impact through its business, targeting a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions from use of its products and production of its equipment by 2030 (compared to 2010 levels) and a challenge target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.Through DANTOTSU Value (customer value creation that generates a positive cycle of improvement of earnings and ESG resolutions), Komatsu will strive to create new values in order to take steady steps forward to the next stage for the workplaces of the future and pass on a sustainable future to the next generation.

       " \"  Komatsu Ltd. today announced its consolidated business results for three months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 (U.S. GAAP). The highlights are described below.1. Results for Three Months Ended June 30, 2022For the first three-month period (April 1- June 30, 2022) of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, the first year of the mid-term management plan, consolidated net sales totaled JPY 763.8 billion, up 17.8% from the corresponding period a year ago. In the construction, mining and utility equipment business, demand for both construction and mining equipment expanded, especially in North America and Asia. While supply chain disruptions continued to affect Komatsu’s production and sales, Komatsu steadily captured expanding demand for new equipment by capitalizing particularly on cross-sourcing. Reflecting steady sales of mining equipment against the backdrop of growing commodity prices and the Japanese yen’s depreciation, sales advanced from the corresponding period a year ago. In the industrial machinery and others business, while sales of the Excimer laser-related business remained strong, supported by expanding demand for semiconductors worldwide, sales of presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools for the automobile manufacturing industry decreased from the corresponding period a year ago. This was affected mainly by reduced sales of medium-sized and large presses. As a result, sales of this business declined from the corresponding period a year ago.With respect to profits for the first three-month period under review, operating income expanded by 51.5% from the corresponding period a year ago, to JPY 93.6 billion. Coupled with the Japanese yen's depreciation, the increase of profits was mainly due to improved selling prices in many regions in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, which more than offset the adverse effects of increased prices of materials and logistics costs. The operating income ratio improved by 2.7 percentage points to 12.2%. Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies expanded by 83.0% to JPY 112.5 billion. Net income attributable to Komatsu Ltd. climbed to JPY 80.5 billion, up 96.7%.2.

       " \"Komatsu Ltd. (President and CEO: Hiroyuki Ogawa), through its subsidiary, Komatsu Cummins Chile Ltda. (KCC; President: Yasuji Nishiura), has agreed with Codelco, a major state-owned mining company in Chile, to collaborate on trialing a new tunnel excavation method using Komatsu's newly developed Mining Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) starting in 2024 at Codelco's Chuquicamata Mine in Chile. Through trial use of the new machine, Komatsu and Codelco aim to speed up the potential introduction of this innovative technology.  Photo: Komatsu’s Mining TBM for underground hard rock mine(Copyright of this image © 2022 Komatsu Ltd. All right reserved)  \\u3000Demand for underground mining equipment is expected to increase along with global demand for mineral resources that require increasingly deeper mining operations. Komatsu developed the first TBM for rock excavation in 1963 for use in civil engineering in Japan. Since that time, the company has introduced a cumulative total of more than 2,300 TBM (including its Micro Tunneling Machine) to the market. Based on Komatsu's experience in excavation, the Mining TBM is equipped with new technologies that enable adaptability to small curves, reversing, and passing intersections in hard rock tunnel excavation. Previously, use of TBM has generally been limited to excavating nearly straight tunnels. This new technology improves the flexibility of the equipment and enables excavation of tunnels according to the more unique designs of each mine.The Mining TBM works by continuously performing a series of processes, such as excavating rock with disc cutters and discharging the chipped rock backwards with belt conveyors, while fortifying the excavated tunnel wall. Excavation with disc cutters improves tunnel strength and stability by creating a circular tunnel shape with smooth walls with less damage to the excavated tunnel (compared to drilling and blasting method). To support customers’ needs for increasingly sustainable ways of mining, the new machine runs off electricity, does not require the use of blasting and performs a series of tunnel excavation processes with a single machine, reducing the number of vehicles required overall. The result is a new excavation option that reduces the creation of greenhouse gases and particulate matter emissions for an improved underground environment that requires less ventilation than other methods. At the same time, it significantly increases the productivity of personnel associated with tunnel excavation work compared to conventional methods. In response to climate change and the need for solutions for environmental issues, Komatsu has been focusing on the development of equipment for the future of underground hard rock mining under the slogan of “No Blasting”, “No Batch”, “No Diesel.” The Mining TBM and the new method embody this forward-looking approach and seek to help customers improve safety, environmental friendliness, and productivity (shorter tunnel construction period and lower tunnel construction costs) at underground mines, and will also help them achieve a revolution in their mining operations.Per the company’s ongoing mid-term management plan “DANTOTSU Value - Together, to ‘The Next’ for sustainable growth”, Komatsu is working to expand offerings for underground hard rock mining, creating new value for customers with the development of new equipment, processes and technologies that will help operations step forward to the next stage for the workplace of the future and provide a more sustainable future for the next generation.Outline of CODELCOCODELCO (Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile) is a state-owned company in Chile, the world's largest copper producer.

In the short-term span, however, we project the volatility will increase as affected by a variety of risks in the external environment. In the industrial machinery and others business, we anticipate that demand for semiconductors will continue to thrive. We also expect to see structural changes in the automobile industry, our client industry against the background of the growing popularity of electric vehicles. As sustainability-impact factors, such as climate change, continue to attract social interest, we developed our Sustainability Policy concerning the achievement of a sustainable society and improvement of our business continuity. Furthermore, we have also made our” 2050 carbon-neutral declaration” as a target of our challenge to satisfy both global warming countermeasures and business growth.   Against this background, we are striving to achieve our vision of developing safe, highly productive, smart and clean workplaces of the future, together with customers, through the growth strategies of the new mid-term management plan. To this end, we are working to create DANTOTSU Value which integrates DANTOTSU Products (advancement of machines), DANTOTSU Service (advancement of machine operations), and DANTOTSU Solutions (advancement of workplace operations). With this creation of customer value that generates a positive cycle for improvement of earnings and ESG resolutions, we will strive for sustainable growth.  (DANTOTSU Value - Customer value creation that generates a positive cycle of improvement of earnings and ESG resolutions)Materiality and Business PortfolioPrior to developing the new mid-term management plan, we have extracted priority areas of important social issues (materiality), to both us and stakeholders. As a result, we have recognized the four areas where our materiality and that of stakeholders overlapped as the most important areas, that is, Environment, Customers, Employees, and Ethics & Governance. To generate a positive cycle for improvement of earnings and ESG resolutions, we have reflected efforts for these four areas to our growth strategies. Concerning our business portfolio, we have also reviewed it when developing the new mid-term management plan. Specifically, we have clarified mid to long-term directions and issues aimed at by each business segment, and reflected them to efforts of focus in the new mid-term management plan. In the construction and mining equipment business, we will focus investments in growth areas and expand the solution and value-chain businesses, as we look into M&A, in order to further improve growth potentials and profitability. Three Pillars of Growth Strategies and Efforts of Focus In the new mid-term management plan, we have continued to emphasize the previous plan’s sustainability management in which we work for sustainable growth through a positive cycle for improvement of earnings and ESG resolutions, and have defined three new pillars of growth strategies, consisting of (1) Accelerate growth by means of innovation, (2) Maximize earnings power, and (3) Enhance corporate resilience. By continuing to focus investments to create value in growth areas and maximizing earning opportunities in existing areas, we will work to further improve profitability and build an operational structure that is resilient to demand changes. Additionally, concerning our management foundation that supports these efforts, we will enhance our corporate capabilities to improve operational efficiency and respond to changes in the external environment.            ESG Resolutions through Growth StrategiesBased on our sustainability policy, it is our determination to continue to contribute to society through business activities in the next 100 years. In the new mid-term management plan, we have selected important issues (materiality) for us and ten new goals which are strongly related to the materiality, from our 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). In order to resolve ESG issues steadily through our growth strategies, we will set KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for key initiative activities and monitor their achievement. We are planning to disclose our progress in the Komatsu Report.     Management Targets in the Mid-term Management Plan Concerning management targets in the new mid-term management plan, while we are keeping the same targes from the previous plan, that is, “Growth,” “Profitability,” “Efficiency,” and “Financial Position,” we have set a new ESG target of the challenge to become carbon neutral by 2050.  With respect to shareholder return, while placing priority on focusing investments in growth areas, we will continue to work for stable dividends for shareholders and maintain the policy of keeping a consolidated payout ratio of 40% or higher.

Difference between non-consolidated results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and those for the previous fiscal year (April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022）[Reasons for the difference]Concerning non-consolidated business results, both sales and profits increased from the previous fiscal year, as demand for construction and mining equipment remained strong around the world, except for China, as the adverse effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic shrank from the previous fiscal year. Increased sales also reflect the Japanese yen’s depreciation. 2. Details of dividend[Reason for the change of projected cash dividend]Komatsu is building a sound financial position and enhancing its competitiveness in order to increase its sustainable corporate value. Concerning cash dividends, Komatsu has the policy of continuing stable payment of dividends after comprehensively considering consolidated business results and reviewing future investment plans, cash flows and the like. Specifically, Komatsu has the policy of maintaining a consolidated payout ratio of 40% or higher.Concerning cash dividends for the fiscal year under review, after considering consolidated business results for the fiscal year under review and future business prospects under its dividend policy, the Company is planning to increase the year-end common stock dividend per share by JPY 16 from the earlier projection of JPY 40 per share. As a result, year-end cash dividend for the fiscal year under review should amount to JPY 56 per share. Annual cash dividends should total JPY 96 per share, including the interim cash dividend which has already been paid, and which shows an increase of JPY 41 per share from the previous fiscal year, ended March 31, 2021.

       " \"Komatsu Ltd. today announced its consolidated business results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (U.S. GAAP). The highlights are described below.In the following, “the Company” expresses Komatsu Ltd. on a non-consolidated basis, while “Komatsu”, on a consolidated basis. 1. Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2022（FY2021）For the fiscal year under review (April 1, 2021 ? March 31, 2022), the final year of the mid-term management plan, consolidated net sales totaled JPY 2,802.3 billion, up 28.0% from the previous fiscal year. In the construction, mining and utility equipment business, demand for both construction and mining equipment was strong around the world, except for China, as the adverse effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic shrank from the previous fiscal year. Komatsu steadily captured expanding demand for new equipment by capitalizing particularly on cross-sourcing, while experiencing the adverse effects of the tight market of marine transportation and semiconductor shortage. Reflecting increased parts sales and service revenues as well, sales expanded sharply from the previous fiscal year. In the industrial machinery and others business, with respect to the businesses of presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools, Komatsu improved sales from the previous fiscal year, by completing installation of machinery at overseas customers’ plants, as the governments of related countries eased their regulations on economic activities. Moreover, sales of the Excimer laser-related business advanced, supported by an increase in global demand for semiconductors. As a result, sales increased from the previous fiscal year.With respect to profits for the fiscal year under review, operating income surged by 89.5% from the previous fiscal year, to JPY 317.0 billion. This was mainly due to expanded sales volume and improved selling prices in many regions in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, as well as the Japanese yen's depreciation, which more than offset the adverse effects of increased prices of materials and logistical costs. The operating income ratio improved by 3.7 percentage points to 11.3%. Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies expanded sharply by 99.4% to JPY 324.5 billion. Net income attributable to Komatsu Ltd. climbed to JPY 224.9 billion, up 111.7%.2. Projections for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2023（FY2022）Concerning the consolidated business results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, Komatsu projects an increase in both sales and profits.In the construction, mining and utility equipment business, Komatsu anticipates an increase in sales against the background of strong demand around the world, centering on North America and Asia, as well as the Japanese yen’s depreciation. Demand in CIS and China is estimated to decline. With respect to segment profit, Komatsu also anticipates an increase, supported by the expected expansion of sales volume, improvement of selling prices, and the Japanese yen’s depreciation, which will absorb the anticipated increase in prices of materials and logistics costs. As of today, it is impossible to predict any impacts, including supply chain confusion, in Russia due to the situation in Ukraine. Therefore, this projection is based on the assumption that Komatsu will sell products that are in local stock or already shipped there as of March 31, 2022.In the retail finance business, Komatsu anticipates a decrease in both sales and segment profit, mainly due to declined sales of used equipment after lease use and no more benefits of improved valuation of equipment after lease use, which were recorded in the previous fiscal year.In the industrial machinery and others business, while the Excimer laser-related business for the semiconductor market is expected to increase sales, Komatsu projects a decline in both sales and segment profit due mainly to reduced sales of medium-sized and large presses to the automobile manufacturing industry.As preconditions for its projection, Komatsu is assuming the foreign exchange rates will be as follows: USD1=JPY 118.0, EUR1=JPY 129.0, and AUD1=JPY 88.0.  3. Cash DividendsConcerning cash dividends for the fiscal year under review, after considering consolidated business results for the fiscal year under review and future business prospects, the Company is planning to increase the year-end common stock dividend per share by JPY 16 from the earlier projection of JPY 40 per share. As a result, year-end cash dividend for the fiscal year under review should amount to JPY 56 per share. Annual cash dividends should total JPY 96 per share, including the interim cash dividend which has already been paid, and which shows an increase of JPY 41 per share from the previous fiscal year, ended March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the consolidated payout ratio will translate into 40.3%. This dividend amount will be proposed to the 153rd ordinary general meeting of shareholders (scheduled for June 21, 2022).Regarding annual cash dividends for the fiscal year, ending March 31, 2023, the Company plans to pay JPY 96 per share, keeping the same amount from the fiscal year under review.

       " '  Komatsu Ltd. (President and CEO: Hiroyuki Ogawa) (hereafter “Komatsu”) today announced that Anglo American Minas-Rio (hereafter \"Anglo American\"), a major British resource group company, and Komatsu have signed a memorandum of understanding through Komatsu Brazil International Ltda., a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu, to carry out a trial of a large ICT mining bulldozer with remote control functionality. The companies intend to trial D375Ai-8 tele remote control bulldozer at Minas-Rio iron mine owned by Anglo American in Brazil. Through this trial, to be conducted this calendar year, the two companies will aim to establish a new solution that advances safety and productivity at mine sites.  Bulldozer D375A at the Minas-Rio mine in Brazil (Non-remotely)  Komatsu has been developing tele remote control large bulldozers for mines with the aim of mass production by the end of FY2022 by integrating the technologies and know-how that the Komatsu Group has cultivated until today. In addition to advancing safety and productivity, the new machine aims to assist customers who have a hard time securing human resources due to a shortage of skilled operators. Leveraging multiple high-quality cameras installed around the vehicle body and work equipment and low-delay video transmission technology, the operator is provided with an operating environment that is close to the actual operation, even though the operation room is several kilometers away from the vehicle. This remote-control system is equipped with auto blade control that eliminates the need for detailed blade operations during excavation and leveling processes (Intelligent Machine Control) with the combination of the machine guidance system “ProVision” from Modular Mining Systems, Inc. (Headquarters: Arizona, USA), a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu. It was difficult to apply the conventional remote-control system to work that requires delicate operability such as leveling due to the influence of delay, but by utilizing this automatic blade control, production close to boarding operation is possible. It will be possible to achieve productivity, and even operators with little driving experience will be able to achieve high-quality work.“We think that this is very important strategic project between Anglo and Komatsu for cutting edge mining technology implementation at actual mine site.

       " \"  Komatsu Ltd. today announced its consolidated business results for Nine months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 (U.S. GAAP). The highlights are described below.1. Results for Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021For the nine-month period (April 1- December 31, 2021) of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, the final year of the mid-term management plan, consolidated net sales totaled JPY 2,014.6 billion, up 33.1% from the corresponding period a year ago. In the construction, mining and utility equipment business, demand for both construction and mining equipment was strong around the world, except for China, as the adverse effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic shrank from the corresponding period a year ago. Komatsu steadily captured expanding demand for new equipment by capitalizing particularly on cross-sourcing, while experiencing the adverse effects of the tight market of marine transportation and semiconductor shortage. Reflecting increased parts sales and service revenues as well, sales expanded sharply from the corresponding period a year ago. In the industrial machinery and others business, with respect to the businesses of presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools, Komatsu improved sales from the corresponding period a year ago, by completing installation work of machinery at overseas customers’ plants, as the governments of related countries eased their regulations on economic activities. Moreover, sales of the Excimer laser-related business expanded, supported by an increase in global demand for semiconductors. As a result, sales advanced sharply from the corresponding period a year ago.With respect to profits for the nine-month period under review, operating income surged by 108.1% from the corresponding period a year ago, to JPY 223.7 billion. This was mainly due to expanded sales volume and improved selling prices in many regions in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, as well as the Japanese yen's depreciation, which more than offsetted the adverse effects of increased prices of materials and logistical costs. The operating income ratio improved by 4.0 percentage points to 11.1%. Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies expanded by 117.0% to JPY 224.3 billion. Net income attributable to Komatsu Ltd. climbed to JPY 155.5 billion, up 135.7%.[Consolidated Financial Highlights]      2.

In 2021, over 590 investors with US$110 trillion in assets and 200 major purchasers with US$5.5 trillion in procurement spend requested companies to disclose data on environmental impacts, risks and opportunities through CDP’s platform and a record number of about 13,000 companies responded. A detailed and independent methodology is used by CDP to assess these companies, allocating a score of A to D- based on the comprehensiveness of disclosure, awareness and management of environmental risks and demonstration of best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets.Komatsu has conventionally positioned environmental activities as one of top management priorities. In the mid-term management plan, Komatsu has also defined ESG as one of management targets and implemented aggressive activities. In order to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in the entire lifecycle of construction and mining equipment, Komatsu has been promoting the introduction of electrified equipment such as batteries and hybrids, and has also started the development of \"power agnostic concept truck\" that can run on a variety of power sources. By enabling efficient operation through automatic operation and remote control using sophisticated digital technologies, Komatsu is also determined to drive its activities to realize a low-carbon society as an industrial leader.In addition, Komatsu has upheld the new long-term vision of achieving carbon neutrality, virtually zero carbon emissions, by 2050, in the integrated report in 2021. Through climate change risk and opportunity assessments and scenario analyses based on TCFD already endorsed, Komatsu will pursue increasing our resilience against climate change impacts. At the same time, Komatsu will advance climate change and water security response measures through a healthy dialogue with stakeholders.   - Paul Simpson, CEO of CDP, said: “Many congratulations to all the companies on this year’s A List. Taking the lead on environmental transparency and action is one of the most important steps businesses can make, even more so in the year of COP26 and the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report. The scale of the risk to businesses from climate change, water insecurity and deforestation can no longer be ignored, and we know the opportunities of action far outweigh the risks of inaction. Leadership from the private sector is essential for securing global ambitions for a net-zero, nature positive and equitable world. Our A List celebrates those companies who are preparing themselves to excel in the economy of the future by taking action today.”  *CDP: CDP is a global non-profit that runs the world’s environmental disclosure system for companies, cities, states and regions.

       " 'Komatsu Ltd. (hereafter “Komatsu”) (President & CEO: Hiroyuki Ogawa) has built a new factory for seal rings, the parts of an undercarriage component, in its Himi Plant 2 as part of structural reforms for growth, one of the efforts of focus in the mid-term management plan. Komatsu held the completion ceremony today, and will start production in November this year. To strengthen its technology development and facilitate the role of being the global Mother plant of casting materials for the Komatsu Group, Komatsu has transplanted the functions of the former seal ring factory, which was built about 60 years ago, into the new factory, thereby working to dynamically improve productivity, labor savings, and reduce CO2 emissions by 50%. Komatsu is advancing production reforms designed to realize the long-term vision of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.  [New seal ring factory]  Komatsu draws its strengths by engaging in in-house development and the manufacture of key components that determine the quality of its construction equipment. By improving the durability and reliability of its key components, for example, Komatsu offers a new service program for construction equipment, which has further prolonged the warranty period of the extended warranty program, thereby striving to further expand the value chain business. Seal rings are high-precision parts which are used to prevent lubricant from leaking inside the undercarriage components, such as final drives*. Seal rings are supplied to other plants of the Komatsu Group, which manufacture the undercarriage components.For the new factory, Komatsu has taken advantage of its group-wide synergy, for example, by installing high-precision, high-efficiency CBN grinders and has also introduced AI-driven automatic inspection machines, both of which were jointly developed by Komatsu NTC Ltd. As a result, the new factory achieves outstanding labor-saving and productivity improvement. On the occasion of opening this new factory, Komatsu is concerting efforts to develop and introduce next-generation components that incorporate all advantages of in-house development and production.In its mid-term management plan, Komatsu has defined the targets of reducing CO2 emissions by 50% raising the ratio of renewable energy use to 50% by 2030 from 2010 levels. As an extension to these targets, Komatsu has recently announced a long-term vision of achieving carbon neutrality, i.e., virtually zero carbon emissions, by 2050. As the casting process, including for seal rings, particularly consumes a large amount of energy, high-efficiency casting, by improving its process, will lead to an outstanding reduction of energy consumption. In addition, Komatsu is also working to improve the environmental performance of the new factory, including the reduction of CO2 emissions, by installing energy-saving equipment and improving the airtightness of the factory building.While remaining committed to Quality and Reliability, Komatsu will work to maximize its corporate value and also achieve safe, highly productive, smart, and clean workplaces of the future by creating DANTOTSU value (solving ESG issues and improving earnings through creation of customer value).*It is one of our power transmission devices through which power is transmitted from the engine to the track, and it determines the final reduction ratio of power, etc.<Outline of the new seal ring factory at Himi Plant 2>･ Address: Himi Plant 2, 1-3, Shimotago, Himi-shi, Toyama 935-8501, Japan･ Total floor area: 8,230 m2･ Manufactured product: Seal rings for components of construction equipment･ Investment: About JPY3.6 billion･ Completion: May 2021･ Production start-up: November 2021<Outline of the Himi Plant>･ Addresses: Plant 1, 2654, Kubo, Himi-shi, Toyama 935-0024, Japan         \\u3000\\u3000\\u3000   Plant 2, 1-3, Shimotago, Himi-shi, Toyama 935-8501, Japan･ Plant manager: Norikatsu Nishiyama･ Site areas: Plant 1, 67,400 m2, and Plant 2, 489,500 m2･ No. of employees: 834 persons (as of March 31, 2021)No : 0062(3077)Corporate Communications DepartmentSustainability Promotion DivisionKomatsu Ltd.tel: +81-(0)3-5561-2616mail: JP00MB_cc_department@global.komatsu*The information may be subject to change without notice.

In addition, demand for the Excimer laser-related business for the semiconductor manufacturing industry remained brisk. As a result, sales advanced from the corresponding period a year ago.With respect to profits for the first six-month period under review, operating income surged by 125.9% from the corresponding period a year ago, to JPY 136.2 billion. This was mainly due to expanded sales volume and improved selling prices in many regions in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, as well as the Japanese yen\\'s depreciation. The operating income ratio improved by 4.3 percentage points to 10.6%. Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies expanded by 133.2% to JPY 136.5 billion.

(President and CEO: Hiroyuki Ogawa) , a global leader in construction and mining equipment, today announced a new collaboration to electrify next-generation underground mining machines using Proterra’s battery technology.Under the collaboration, Proterra will supply its H Series battery system technology to Komatsu for the development of battery-electric LHDs, drills and bolters for underground hard rock mining. Mining equipment and services provider Komatsu plans to utilize Proterra’s high-performance battery systems for the development of prototype machines this year before the expected commencement of commercial production in 2022.A Komatsu underground LHD is pictured with Proterra batteries.The collaboration represents Proterra’s entry into the underground mining equipment market.“Proterra is excited to build on our relationship with a proven, industry-leader like Komatsu to electrify mining machines with our EV technology,” said Gareth Joyce, President of Proterra. “The benefits of zero-emissions, battery-electric vehicles extend far beyond our roads and cities. Switching to battery-electric technology means helping protect clean air for those working in underground mines while delivering a high-performance technology solution where safety and reliability are paramount.”“INSERT PROTERRA QUOTE” President of Proterra – division“We are excited to be working with Proterra to bring zero-emissions mining solutions to underground hard rock,” said Josh Wagner, vice president of hard rock mining at Komatsu. “Leveraging their battery technology, we seek to offer customers increasing sustainable solutions for their operations.” This is the second collaboration between Proterra and Komatsu. The two companies previously announced an agreement in which Proterra supplies its industry-leading battery systems to support Komatsu in electrifying its first medium-sized hydraulic excavators.Komatsu has helped advance customer options to mitigate environmental impact through product development for many years, through initiatives such as its hybrid hydraulic excavators kickoff in 2008, which marked the world’s first hybrid construction equipment on the market. This year, Komatsu also announced its new Greenhouse Gas (GHG) alliance with customers to actively collaborate on product planning, development, testing and deployment of the next generation of zero-emission mining equipment and infrastructure. The alliance’s initial target is advancing Komatsu’s power-agnostic truck concept for a haulage vehicle that can run on a variety of power sources including diesel electric, electric, trolley (wired), battery power and even hydrogen fuel cells.Designed and manufactured in the United States, Proterra battery systems leverage industry-leading energy density and a customizable design to fit within a variety of vehicles. Proterra’s best-in-class battery systems have been proven in more than 20 million service miles driven by Proterra transit vehicles and selected by world-class commercial vehicle manufacturers to power heavy-duty vehicles, including construction equipment.Proterra battery systems offer an outstanding application for confined, underground mining settings where safety and durability are of utmost importance, while helping to mitigate air and noise pollution through battery-electric technology. Proterra uses rigorous testing to ensure Proterra battery packs are designed to withstand tough conditions and meet or exceed the latest functional safety standards. Proterra battery systems incorporate liquid thermal conditioning, monitoring sensors throughout the battery pack, as well as active and passive protective features like passive propagation resistance to isolate individual battery cells in the rare case of a thermal event.
