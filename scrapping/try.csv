The SEK 65 million ($6.3 million) investment from Volvo Group will allow for the phased production of electric wheel loaders.
A milestone in the company’s ambition to be entirely fossil free by 2040, the move will also go a long way to fulfilling Volvo CE’s aim for 35% of machines sold to be electric by 2030.
The SEK 65 million (around $6.3 million) investment from Volvo Group will allow the Arvika factory in Sweden – which specializes in the production of medium and large wheel loaders – to expand its facilities with a new building and allow for the phased introduction of new electric wheel loaders.
It is not only a milestone in the plant’s almost 140-year history, but a significant moment for Volvo CE and its determination to be completely fossil free by 2040 – in line with the aims of the Paris Agreement and as laid out in the manufacturer’s industry leading Science-Based Target goals. It is also a pioneering step forward in its ambition for 35% of its machines sold to be electric by 2030.
Coming soon after an announcement to invest in electric haulers from the company’s production facility in Braås, Sweden, it is also a signpost that Volvo CE is committed to achieving more sustainable solutions for customers across all its product lines – and is dedicated to driving that change forward in the here and now. These announcements are part of an investment strategy that allows Volvo CE to advance electric solutions across its production facilities, including also the Konz facility in Germany, Belley in France and Changwon in South Korea, where other electric machines are made.
Site Manager Mikael Liljestrand says: “This is a clear signal of our commitment to building the world we want to live in. It is more than 40 years since we last invested in a new building and what better reason now than to invest in our future, our planet and the next generation. We know that this is not only important to our customers and stakeholders, who rightly have high expectations on us, but it is also close to our hearts to be part of something bigger in building our future.”
Volvo CE has already successfully introduced compact electric wheel loaders to the global market with the L20 Electric and L25 Electric wheel loaders proving to be efficient, zero-exhaust emission solutions capable of driving down carbon emissions while maintaining high productivity across a variety of customer applications. Together with the ECR25 Electric, ECR18 Electric and EC18 Electric compact excavators and the mid-size EC230 Electric excavator, Volvo CE has one of the largest electric ranges on the market.
SUSTAINABILITY TRANSFORMATION
Thanks to the investment, Arvika will erect a new building, approximately 1,500 sq m, which will allow the facility to free up areas inside its assembly factory to be able to build electric wheel loaders. While it has not yet been announced which models will begin their electric transformation and exactly when, production of both electric wheel loaders and more traditional wheel loaders fitted with combustion engines will continue for now on the same production line.
Volvo CE will ensure a phased introduction model by model, taking into account all aspects of the electric ecosystem as it does so, including infrastructure requirements, charging solutions, battery handling and business models. The result will be reliable mid-size and larger electric wheel loaders that can easily be integrated into customers’ business.
It is not the first sustainability initiative from the Arvika facility. Despite actually increasing production last year, the factory managed to reduce its internal climate footprint by 350 tons of CO2 thanks to a variety of emission reduction efforts.
“Our goal at the factory in Arvika, as well as Volvo CE and the entire Volvo Group is to be climate-smart and to produce fossil-free machines,” continues Mikael. “Together, we are quite clear that we want to lead this transformation and be the driving force of more sustainable ways of working for the benefit of our planet. This investment is Arvika’s exciting first step towards electrification.”
Building work is set to begin later this year, with further announcements on when production will begin to come."

By Press information,1/18/2023,https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/news-and-events/press-releases/2023/volvo-ce-introduces-first-electric-machine-for-road-segment/,VOLVO CE INTRODUCES FIRST ELECTRIC MACHINE FOR ROAD SEGMENT,Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) is unveiling its latest addition to its growing portfolio of electric machines – and its first for the road segment – with the DD25 Electric asphalt compactor.,"The DD25 Electric will be unveiled at CONEXPO 2023 in Las Vegas, from March 14-18 – and is expected to be available on select markets from Q1 2024
A compact double-drum asphalt compactor, the DD25 Electric is a zero-exhaust emission solution for small scale compaction projects including street repairs and patching, parking lots, driveways, municipalities and rental houses
Its introduction is an important milestone in Volvo CE’s journey toward electromobility and its ambition to build a more sustainable construction future
The Volvo DD25 Electric will make its debut at this year’s CONEXPO trade show in Las Vegas. The newest addition to Volvo CE’s lineup of electric machines, the DD25 Electric is the first Volvo CE produced electric machine designed specifically for the asphalt industry.
This latest innovation is an important milestone in Volvo CE’s ambition to reach net zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 – as validated by the Science Based Targets initiative – and is part of Volvo Group’s target to have at least 35% of its total range of vehicles fully electric by 2030.
Ray Gallant, Vice President Product Management and Productivity at Volvo CE North America, says: “As a global leader in construction solutions, delivering premium products and services, we not only have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, but we are committed to leading the way and providing real-life solutions for our customers that will help them meet their own sustainability goals. We are proud to expand our portfolio of electric machines and extend our offering to the road segment.”
The DD25 Electric is the first Volvo CE produced electric machine designed specifically for the asphalt industry.
PAVING THE WAY FOR ZERO EMISSIONS
The electric driveline of the DD25 Electric is based upon the same proven architecture and components found on Volvo CE’s ECR25 Electric compact excavator and L25 Electric compact wheel loader - the first electric machines available for the construction market, launched in 2020 - which are proving a success in a variety of different applications and markets across the globe.
Its zero-emission operation makes the DD25 Electric ideal for sensitive or urban environments with strict emission regulations and for organizations who are looking to meet their own sustainability goals. Zero tailpipe emissions also mean a cleaner and more enjoyable work environment for operators, site teams and passers-by. If used alongside other electric powered equipment, such as the Volvo EC18 Electric, ECR18 Electric and the ECR25 Electric compact excavators, the larger EC230 Electric excavator, or the L25 Electric and L20 Electric compact wheel loaders, the DD25 Electric offers the opportunity for a zero-emission workplace.
Expected to operate for a full shift on a single charge depending upon the type of job and intensity of the work cycle, the DD25 Electric has the same charging solutions as its forerunners the ECR25 Electric and L25 Electric, allowing customers to choose the right solution depending on their operational requirements. The machine comes with an integrated on-board charger which enables charging from 0 to 100% in as little as three hours depending on AC power level. With an optional off-board DC fast charger this can be achieved in little over an hour, and this also offers a practical solution to top-up the machine’s charge during the lunch break.

HIGH PERFORMING
Combining the proven Volvo Asphalt Compactor platform with battery power, the DD25 Electric offers 24 kW of available power, 30% more than the conventional Volvo DD25B. The result is a more responsive machine in terms of speed and vibrations, which performs better on grade, thanks to the size of its components, and better at high elevations, when compared to a diesel machine which loses power as you increase altitude.
360-degree visibility and high frequency compaction allow operators to achieve a smooth finish asphalt surface with speed. Frequency can be adjusted from 3500 vpm / 55 Hz to 4000 vpm / 67 Hz to cater for different applications.
And with no engine to service - and electric components, batteries and motors all maintenance free, maintenance requirements are reduced too, saving customers time and money.
With the introduction of this latest electric machine, Volvo CE continues to lead the way with products and solutions to help its customers reduce their total cost of ownership and carbon footprint, while meeting its own sustainability goals."
